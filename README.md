# Master_thesis_AJ_22_23

This repository functions as lab notebook for the master thesis: <br>
"USING REPROCESSED PUBLIC PROTEOMIC DATA TO PREDICT PROTEIN PATTERNS IN HUMAN CELL LINES" <br> <br>
In the *Reference* folder, all material created by Tine Claeys is located. Many of the work is based on this material. <br>
The material specifically for this project is located in the *master_thesis* folder. <br>
This folder is subdivided in five parts: <br>
- Scraper: contains a notebook used to find PXD-projects via the Cellosaurus database.
- Metadata: files with manually annotated data for files and projects
- Database: notebooks used for creating the MySQL database
- Atlas_creation: notebooks used to create the protein expression atlas and make t-SNE visualisations of this atlas
- Atlas_analysis: notebook containing exploratory data analysis of the protein expression atlas.
