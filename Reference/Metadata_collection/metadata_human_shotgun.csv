PXD003411	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD003411	Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - secreted proteins of inflammatory stimulated endothelial cells	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

Dimethyl labeled proteins of platelets in resting (light label) and activated state (collagen and thrombin activation, intermediate label) from three healthy volunteers fractionated by SCX, analyzed on a LTQ Obitrap Velos using a data dependent decision tree method (HCD/ETD).Peak lists were generated from the raw data files using the Proteome Discoverer software package version 1.3.339. Peptide identification was performed by searching the individual peak lists (HCD, ETD-IT and ETD-FT) against a concatenated target-decoy database containing the human sequences in the Uniprot database (release 2012_06) supplemented with a common contaminants database using the Mascot search engine version 2.3 (Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom) via the Proteome Discoverer interface (version 1.3). The search parameters included the use of semitrypsin as proteolytic enzyme allowing up to a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification whereas oxidation of methionines and the dimethyl light and intermediate labels on N-termini and lysine residues were set as variable modifications. Precursor mass tolerance was initially set at 50 ppm, while fragment mass tolerance was set at 0.6 Da for ETD-IT fragmentation and 0.05 Da for HCD and ETD-FT fragmentation. Subsequently, the peptide identifications were filtered for true mass accuracy <4 ppm and an ion score of 40 until an FDR <1% at peptide level was achieved.

ProteoMinerTM is an equalizing technique by reducing high-abundance proteins and enriching low-abundance proteins in biological liquids. With triton X-100/TBS buffer extraction, ProteoMinerTM enrichment and peptide fractionation, 25 MPs with 73 unique peptides were identified from four human tissues, including 10 membrane proteins and 6 nucleus proteins. Then 18 MPs were confirmed with at least 2 unique peptide identification and 6 MPs were confirmed with 1 unique peptide identification by PRM assay.

PXD001421	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001421	Comprehensive Assessment of Proteins Regulated by Dexamethasone Reveals Novel Effects in Primary Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells - nuclear proteins of dexamethasone-treated inflammatory stimulated cells	Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GRO? was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

PXD004626	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD004626	Multi-omics analysis of serum samples demonstrates reprogramming of organ functions via systemic calcium mobilization and platelet activation in metastatic melanoma patients - proteins from serum samples of healthy donors	Pathophysiology of cancer-associated syndroms such as cachexia is poorly understood and no routine biomarkers have been established, yet. Using shotgun proteomics, known marker molecules including PMEL, CRP, SAA and CSPG4 were found deregulated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Targeted analysis of 58 selected proteins with multiple reaction monitoring was applied for independent data verification. In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.

PXD009310	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009310	The platelet releasate in healthy population and pregancy	Upon activation, platelets release a multitude of soluble and vesicular signals, collectively termed the �platelet releasate� (PR). This PR plays an important role in haemostasis, wound healing and the inflammatory response. We and others have used qualitative/quantitative proteomic approaches to characterise the PR; however, with reports of marked inter-individual variability, confident and reliable insights have been hindered. Here we aimed to provide a reproducible and quantifiable proteomic analysis and establish a 'core' human PR, as well as to assess its variability in healthy human pregnancy where increased platelet activation is observed. 896 proteins from thrombin-induced PRs were quantified across 32healthy donors, with 277 proteins forming a �core� PR with low variability. All 277 core PR proteins were identified in pregnancy. Furthermore 69 proteins were found differentially released from platelets in healthy human pregnancy. In summary, the PR comprises a �core� set of proteins between healthy individuals. This dynamic proteome significantly changes in physiologic and pathologic conditions. Thus, the PR is a barcode for the health status of an individual at a given time.

MS/MS spectra were searched by the Andromeda search engine against a human FASTA (August 2016) obtained from UniProt.  MQ analysis included an initial search with a precursor mass tolerance of 20ppm the results of which were used for mass recalibration. In the main Andromeda search precursor mass and fragment mass had an initial mass tolerance of 6ppm and 20ppm, respectively. The search included fixed modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids and a maximum of 2 miscleavages was allowed. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.01 for peptide/protein identification.  For the PR analysis across healthy population we used label-free quantification (LFQ) with a minimum of two ratio counts to determine the normalized protein intensity. LFQ intensities were assigned to identified proteins by comparing the area under the curve of the signal intensity for any given peptide. Protein IDs were filtered to eliminate identifications from the reverse database, proteins only identified by site, and common contaminants. LFQ values were Log2 transformed unless otherwise indicated.  A protein was included in our �core� PR if it was found in 32 from 32 donors.  For pregnancy analysis total protein apprach (TPA) was used.

PXD006578	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006578	Aging-related proteome alterations in B cells may predispose for chronic lymphocytic leukemia - cytoplasmic proteins of CLL cells	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of leukemia in adults, is still incurable despite the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

PXD002212	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD002212	Quantification of cytokines secreted by primary human cells using MRM: evaluation of analytical parameters � shotgun secretome data of untreated HUVECs	The determination of secreted proteins may provide highly valuable information about cell functions. While the typical methods for the determination of biologically relevant but low-abundant molecular species still relies on the use of specific antibodies, mass spectrometry-based methods are now gaining sufficient sensitivity to cope with such challenges. In the current study we have identified several cytokines and chemokines which were induced by inflammatory activation of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Based on the high-resolution mass spectrometry data obtained with a Q Exactive orbitrap, we built an MRM method to quantify the most relevant molecules selected from the screening experiment. Using nano-flow Chip-HPLC coupled to a 6490 triple-quadrupole MS for MRM analyses we achieved calibration curves covering a linear range of four orders of magnitude and detection limits in the low attomol per microliter concentration range. Carryover was consistently less than 0.005%, the accuracy between 80% and 120% and the median coefficient of variation for LC/MS was only 2.2%. When including the variance introduced by biological replicates and the digestion procedure, the coefficient of variation was less than 20% for most peptides. Selection of appropriate marker molecules allowed us to monitor typical cell culture variations such as different cell densities, proliferative states and the occurrence of cell death. As a result, here we present a robust and efficient MRM-based assay for the accurate and sensitive determination of cytokines and chemokines representative for functional cell states and including comprehensive quality controls.

PXD007744	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007744	Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Specialized Wiring of Signaling Pathways that Protects Human Regulatory T Cell Identity - 6 populations ex vivo	Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) are functionally distinct from conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs). To understand Treg identity, we compared by proteomics and transcriptomics human na�ve (n) and effector (e)Tregs, Tconvs and transitional FOXP3+ cells. Only 12% of 422 differentially expressed proteins was identified as such at the mRNA level, demonstrating the importance of direct proteome measurement. Fifty-one proteins discriminated Tregs from Tconvs. This common Treg protein signature indicates altered signaling by TCR-, TNF receptor-, NF?B-, PI3 kinase/mTOR-, NFAT- and STAT pathways, and unique cell biological and metabolic features. Another protein signature uniquely identified eTregs and revealed active cell division, apoptosis sensitivity and suppression of NF?B- and STAT signaling. eTreg fate appears consolidated by FOXP3 outnumbering its partner transcription factors. These features explain why eTregs cannot produce inflammatory cytokines, whereas transitional FOXP3+ cells can. Collectively, our data reveal that Treg identity is defined and protected by uniquely �wired� signaling pathways. Associated GEO dataset is available at GSE90600.

Protein extraction and generation of tryptic peptides from dental calculus was performed using a filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol, modified for ancient samples, on 92 samples of archaeological dental calculus. Samples were extracted at three laboratories; the Functional Genomics Centre Z�rich (FGCZ), the Centre for GeoGenetics at the National History Museum of Denmark, and BioArCh at the University of York. Sample extracts were sequenced (LC-MS/MS) using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (FGCZ), a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap and an LTQ-Orbitrap Elite (Central Proteomics Facility, Target Discovery Institute, Oxford).

We found the majority of MPs were distributed in low molecular weight (LMW) ranges, especially in 0-40 kDa. The identification of LMW proteins is challenging owing to their low length, low abundancy, and hydrophobicity. Even worse, many sequences from Trypsin digestion are unlikely to yield detectable peptides or composed less number of observable peptides in MS detection. Therefore, we focused on small MPs by combining LMW protein enrichment and mirror-protease strategy on human testis samples. The in-depth testis LMW protein profiling documented 4,063 proteins from which 2,565 proteins were belong to LMW proteins and 1,130 proteins had mirror peptides. This provided mass spectral evidence for small MPs further verification, and two MPs were verified in seven identified MPs. For Q8N688, confident peptides were verified from Trypsin and LysargiNase digestions, and continuous b/y-ion peptide was obtained by mirror-spectrum matching. Two verified peptides of Q86WR6 were from gel-separation and gel-elution dataset, respectively. And the other 5 MPs cannot be distinguished sufficiently as PE1, but need more verification information.

PXD007592	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007592	Proteomics-based insights into mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor resistance of cerebral melanoma metastases	Background MAP kinase inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy for BRAF mutated melanoma is characterized by high response rates but also development of drug resistance within a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9 to 12 months. Understanding mechanisms of resistance and identifying effective therapeutic alternatives is one of the most important scientific challenges in melanoma. Using proteomics, we want to specifically gain insight into the pathophysiological process of cerebral metastases. Methods Cerebral metastases from melanoma patients were prepared for MS analysis by tryptic digestion. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a QExactive HF hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer, equipped with a nanospray ion source, coupled with a nano HPLC system.  Results In this pilot study, we were able to identify 5,977 proteins by LC-MS analysis. Samples were classified into good and poor responders based on PFS. By evaluating these proteomic profiles according to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG pathways and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we could characterize differences between the two distinct groups. We further detected an EMT signature, V-type proton ATPases, calcium ion binding proteins, eukaryotic translation initiation factors, cell adhesion proteins and several transporter and exchanger proteins to be significantly up-regulated in poor responding patients, whereas good responders showed an immune-activation and involvement of extracellular matrix structural constituents, among other features. Subsequently we identified the most class-discriminating proteins based on nearest shrunken centroids. Conclusions Using proteomics helped to identify already known extra-cerebral resistance mechanisms in the cerebral metastases and further discovered possible brain specific mechanisms of drug efflux, which might serve as interesting targets, especially for treatment of these types of metastases or as predictive marker.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson�s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation. The search result files were loaded into Pinnacle version 1.0.26.0, and the spectral library threshold settings included a Percolator q-value less than 0.05, XCorr scores above 1.5/2.0/2.2 for singly/doubly/triply charged peptides, and a Mascot Ion score > 29. Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson�s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).	29/07/2016	"[[""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201600300"",""PMID:28195392""]]"

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GRO? was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

We aimed to identify a reliable panel of biological predictors, present in synovial fluid, which can be used in the preoperative setting to optimise patient selection and therapy efficacy. The-long term aim is to reduce the number of patients who progress to end-stage OA and require knee replacement by making earlier, less invasive treatments more effective. In this first stage, we have taken synovial fluid aspirates from patients undergoing autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) at our centre in Oswestry, UK. Synovial fluids (SFs) were obtained from 14 ACI responders (mean Lysholm improvement of 33 (17-54)) and 13 non-responders (mean Lysholm decrease of 14 (4-46)) at the two stages of surgery (cartilage harvest and chondrocyte implantation).

Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (HFS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene CMG2. Patients develop subcutaneous nodules and painful joint contracture. CMG2 is a transmembrane protein of poorly understood physiological function. To understand better the pathogenesis of HFS and the role of CMG2 in this disease, we compared by mass-spectrometry the composition of nodular and matching non-nodular tissues. Two tissue pairs were analyzed, both obtained after surgical resection of nodules from a HFS patient. Our shotgun proteomics analysis showed that nodules were enriched in serum protein, which correlated with previous descriptions of blood vessel leakage in these tissues. Importantly, we also observed a clear accumulation of collagen VI in nodules. Collagen VI accumulation was caused by CMG2 loss-of-function and is the main cause of the nodule formation.

PXD009996	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009996	Proteogenomic systems analysis identifies targeted therapy resistance mechanisms in EGFR-mutated lung cancer	Cancer precision medicine largely relies on knowledge about genetic aberrations in tumors and next-generation-sequencing studies have shown a high mutational complexity in many cancers. Although a large number of the observed mutations is believed to be not causally linked with cancer, the functional effects of many rare mutations but also of combinations of driver mutations are often unknown. Here, we perform a systems analysis of a model of EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer resistant to targeted therapy that integrates whole exome sequencing, global time-course discovery phosphoproteomics and computational modeling to identify functionally relevant molecular alterations. Our approach allows for a complexity reduction from over 2,000 genetic events potentially involved in mediating resistance to only 44 phosphoproteins and 35 topologically close genetic alterations. We perform single- and combination-drug testing against the predicted phosphoproteins and discovered that targeting of HSPB1, DBNL and AKT1 showed potent anti-proliferative effects overcoming resistance against EGFR-inhibitory therapy. Our approach may therefore be used to complement mutational profiling to identify functionally relevant molecular aberrations and propose combination therapies across cancers.

In the field of neuroproteomics the most popular mass spectrometry-based strategy for biomarker discovery studies is data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. In this study we evaluate the use of DIA for native CSF analytics with particular focus on spectral library generation for data analysis, DIA data reproducibility and identification of brain specific proteins.

Trypsin was selected as digestion enzyme with two maximum missed cleavage sites. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm and fragment mass tolerance to 20 mmu. Oxidation at methionine was set as dynamic modification, carbamidomethylation as static modification at cysteine. Using the target decoy PSM validator decoy database search was performed with target FDR of 1%). For analysis with Spectronaut different spectral libraries were generated by using Spectronaut 9.0 (Biognosys). Therefore, different .MSF files from PD were uploaded to the �Prepare� perspective of Spectronaut and treated with the following settings: for identification only peptides with high confidence level (equals a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%) were considered and protein inference was performed by Spectronaut. Spectral Library Filters were set to no missed cleavage filters, no peptide charge filters, number of best fragment ions between 3 and 6 in a mass range of 300 � 1800 m/z. The first library (library A) consisted of five .MSF files of untreated CSF samples. The second library (library B) was generated by using library A plus 5 .MSF files of analyzed whole blood. The third library (library C) contained library A and additional 54 .MSF files originating from human substantia nigra analyses. The fourth library (library D) combined library B. These Libraries were used to analyze native CSF measured in data-independent (DIA) mode, subdividing a mass range of 400 � 1000 m/z into 30 isolation windows with an equal width of 20 m/z and one full scan with a loop cycle of 10. The full MS was performed with a resolution of 30,000 at 200 m/z (AGC 3e6, 80 ms maximum injection time). DIA analysis was operated with a resolution of 15,000 at 200 m/z (AGC 1e6, auto maximum injection time, default charge state 2). This ended up in a cycle time of approx. 2.2 s. The .RAW files were converted into .HTRMS files by using the Raw to HTRMS Converter Professional provided by Biognosys. Those .HTRMS files were analyzed via Spectronaut 9.0 in the �Review� perspective by applying the four different libraries in single experiments. The following settings were applied: dynamic XIC RT Extraction Window, enabled Interference Correction, enabled Cross Run Normalization, quantitation on MS2 level, automatic Protein Inference Workflow and p-value normal distribution estimator.

PXD004625	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD004625	Multi-omics analysis of serum samples demonstrates reprogramming of organ functions via systemic calcium mobilization and platelet activation in metastatic melanoma patients - proteins from serum samples of melanoma patients with low tumor load	Pathophysiology of cancer-associated syndroms such as cachexia is poorly understood and no routine biomarkers have been established, yet. Using shotgun proteomics, known marker molecules including PMEL, CRP, SAA and CSPG4 were found deregulated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Targeted analysis of 58 selected proteins with multiple reaction monitoring was applied for independent data verification. In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.

PXD009752	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009752	LC-MSMS of the lc2 MHC class I immunopeptidome	MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson�s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation. The search result files were loaded into Pinnacle version 1.0.26.0, and the spectral library threshold settings included a Percolator q-value less than 0.05, XCorr scores above 1.5/2.0/2.2 for singly/doubly/triply charged peptides, and a Mascot Ion score > 29. Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson�s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).	29/07/2016	"[[""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201600300"",""PMID:28195392""]]"

In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators. The present data suggest that successful pharmacological abrogation of the formation of lipid inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts may not suffice to suppress the release of several other powerful inflammatory mediators which we thus understand to be capable of establishing chronic inflammation states.

PXD001325	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001325	Proteome profiling of breast cancer biopsies reveals a wound healing signature of cancer-associated fibroblasts - tumor-distant tissue sections	Breast cancer is still the most common type of cancer in women; an important role in carcinogenesis is actually attributed to cancer-associated fibroblasts. In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGF? or IL-1?, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGF? in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.

In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GRO? was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

Principal component analysis clearly distinguished adenomas from normal mucosal samples, and cancer cell lines from HCEC cells. Two hundred twelve (212) proteins displayed significant expression changes in adenomatous tissues in comparison with normal mucosa samples (q-value < 0.02, mean fold change vs. normal mucosa  +/-1.4). These proteomic data showed correlation (r=0.7) with transcriptomic data from our previous studies. One-fourth of these proteins (51) had similar expression changes in colorectal cancer cells (vs. HCEC cells) and were therefore confidently attributed to the epithelial component of adenomas. Although benign, adenomas already displayed cancer-associated proteomic changes since the vast majority (91%) of the 76 upregulated proteins in these lesions have been previously reported in cancer. Validation studies were performed on one of the most significantly upregulated proteins, sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD), a key enzyme in the polyol pathway. SORD concentrations and activity were dramatically increased in adenomas and cancer cell lines, where important changes were also noted in the expression of other enzymes in the same (AKR1B1) and related (KHK) pathways. Dysregulation of the polyol pathway may represent a novel aspect/facet of the metabolome remodelling associated with tumorigenesis.	3/04/2014	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:24567419""]]"
PXD008217	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008217	Proteomic Evidence of Ancient Mongolian Dietary Dairy Sources in Ancient Dental Calculus	To investigate dairy consumption in ancient Mongolia, we analysed dental calculus samples from four Late Bronze Age (LBA, 1500-1000 BCE) individuals for proteomic evidence of milk proteins. As many archaeological sites before Mongolia's Iron Age suffer from a dearth of occupational materials, looking to biomolecular markers of dietary intake can open new investigational avenues into ancient economies. In this case, we use a previously established method of extracting proteins from calculus to explore the consumption of dairy products at LBA Khirigsuur sites in northern Mongolia's Hovsgol Aimag. Seven of nine individual's calculus contained peptides from the whey protein Beta-lactoglobulin from Ovis, Capra hircus, Bos, and general Bovidae species.  Aside from proteomics, these and 16 other individuals from the site were analysed for aDNA. We found that 18 of the 20 were primarily from one genetic ancestral group, and Ancient North Eurasian (ANE). One of the outliers represents a combination of ANE and Western Steppe Herder (WSH), with the other a combination of ANE and Eastern Asian (EE). This finding, while important in its own right, evidences the earliest known dairy consumption in Mongolia, and supports a widely held assumption that pastoralism was a primary subsistence strategy in the ancient Eastern Steppes. The combined proteomic and DNA evidence suggest that Western Steppe dairy animals and technology entered Mongolia before genetic admixture.

PXD008311	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008311	The impact of oncogenic EGFRvIII on the proteome of extracellular vesicles (exosomes) released from glioblastoma cells	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous form of primary brain tumors, driven by a complex repertoire of oncogenic alterations, including the constitutively active epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII). EGFRvIII impacts both cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous aspects of GBM progression, including cell invasion, angiogenesis and modulation of the tumor microenvoiront, this is, at least in part, attributable to the release and intercellular trafficking of extracellular vesicles (EVs), heterogeneous membrane structures containing multiple bioactive macromolecules. Here we analyzed the impact of EGFRvIII on the profile of glioma EVs using a series of isogenic tumor cell lines, in which this oncogene exhibits a strong transforming activity. Thus, we observed that EGFRvIII expression alters several properties of glioma EVs, including their output and global protein composition. Using mass spectrometry, quantitative proteomic analysis and Gene Ontology terms filters, we observed that EVs released by EGFRVIII-transformed cells were enriched for extracellular exosome and focal adhesion related proteins. Among them, we validated the association of pro-invasive proteins (CD44, BSG, CD151) with EVs of EGFRvIII expressing cells, and down-regulation of exosomal markers (CD81 and CD82) in EVs of their indolent counterparts. Nano-flow cytometry revealed that the EV output from individual glioma cell lines was highly heterogeneous, such that only a fraction of EVs contained specific proteins such as EGFR, CD9, or others. Notably, cells expressing EGFRvIII released ample EVs double positive for CD44/BSG, and these proteins also co-localized in cellular filopodia. We also detected the expression of homophilic adhesion molecules and increased homologous EV uptake by EGFRvIII-positive glioma cells. These results suggest that oncogenic EGFRvIII reprograms the proteome of GBM-related EVs, a notion with considerable implications for their biological activity and properties relevant for development of EV-based cancer biomarkers.

However, the corresponding selection is often not based on a fit-for-purpose evaluation. Here we report a comparison of in-gel (IGD), in-solution (ISD), on-filter (OFD), and on-pellet digestion (OPD) workflows on the basis of targeted (QconCAT-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method for mitochondrial proteins) and discovery proteomics (data dependent acquisition, DDA) analyses using three different human head and neck tissues (i.e. nasal polyps, parotid gland, and palatine tonsils). Our study reveals differences between the sample preparation methods, for example with respect to protein and peptide losses, quantification variability, protocol-induced methionine oxidation and asparagine/glutamine deamidation as well as identification of cysteine containing peptides. Moreover, none of the methods performed best for all types of tissues, which seemingly argues against the existence of a universal sample preparation method for proteome analysis.

Raw data for the targeted proteomics analyses were processed using the Skyline software (version 3.5), and were furthermore analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2013 (more details on processing of targeted proteomics data have been published previously21). Shotgun proteomics data were processed using PEAKS Studio software (version 8.0)32, and peak lists were searched against the UniProtKB homo sapiens �UP000005640� reference proteome (canonical; 70956 entries; downloaded on December 15, 2016) with trypsin selected as proteinase (? 3 missed cleavages), cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification, methionine oxidation as variable oxidation, and allowing ? 6 modifications per peptide, ? 10.0 ppm precursor mass deviation (using monoisotopic mass), ? 0.2 Da fragment ion deviation, and ? 1.0% false discovery rates (FDR) for peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), proteins and peptides for the principal analyses. For evaluation of cysteine carbamidomethylation efficiency, this modification was set to variable; for assessment of protocol-induced asparagine and glutamine deamidation, the corresponding modification was added as variable modification; and any further modification assessment was based on PEAKS PTM (including all 485 built-in modifications) and SPIDER searches on spectra with de novo ALC (Average Local Confidence) scores greater than 15%. Label-free quantification using ion counts was performed on the basis of the results of the principal PEAKS search, as described above, followed by further filtering and processing of the data using an in-house developed script in R (version 3.4.0) and R Studio (version 1.0.143). With respect to peptide quantification, peptide areas were summed for peptides with corresponding primary amino acid sequence thus including all PTMs and charge states. For protein quantification, areas of peptides belonging to the same protein group were summed, yet only if they were unique for the corresponding protein group. For both peptide and protein quantification, DDA data was scaled by median scale normalization. Bioinformatics analysis. Data analysis was performed using R, R studio, Microsoft Excel, and GraphPad Prism (version 5.00). For assessment of (relative) recovery and precision, peptides and proteins that were measured in all 20 samples originating from the same tissue (four sample preparation approaches, five replicates per approach) were included, and average levels as well as coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for every approach, of which the latter values were used for evaluating the precision of the sample preparation method. For every peptide/protein, the highest average quantity was set to 100% and the other three average quantities were related to this maximum value thereby obtaining relative peptide/protein levels which were used for evaluation of the recovery of the sample preparation approaches. Assessment of the discovery potential for each of the sample preparation methods was based on comparing the amounts of proteins and peptides identified (in three out of five, four out of five, and five out of five replicates) per method as well as based on comparisons of the trypsin cleavage efficiencies, the fractions of cysteine-containing peptides (relative to the total number of peptides), methionine oxidized peptides (relative to the total number of methionine containing peptides), and asparagine and/or glutamine deamidated peptides (relative to the total number of asparagine and/or glutamine containing peptides) for each method. Furthermore, relevant modifications as pointed out by the PEAKS PTM and SPIDER searches were included as well. Comparisons of the selected physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight (MW), isoelectric point (pI), and hydrophobicity, expressed as grand average of hydropathy (GRAVY) scores calculated using the method of Kyte & Doolittle27) of the proteins and peptides identified in at least three out of five replicates per sample preparation method were enabled by using the R �Peptides� package (version 2.2, 2017-06-05). For visualization of the corresponding data, density plots were obtained using the R �ggplot2� package (version 2.2.1.9000, 2016-12-30).	19/12/2017	"[[""DOI:10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00600"",""PMID:29608294""]]"
PXD001326	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001326	Proteome profiling of breast cancer biopsies reveals a wound healing signature of cancer-associated fibroblasts - bulk tumor tissue	Breast cancer is still the most common type of cancer in women; an important role in carcinogenesis is actually attributed to cancer-associated fibroblasts. In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGF? or IL-1?, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGF? in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.

PXD000004	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000004	Identification and quantification of human postmortem frontal cortex proteome with a SILAM mouse brain standard	Prefrontal cortex tissue slices from a cognitively and neurpathologically normal human subject were obtained from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Brain Bank. 300-350 mg grey matter was homogenized in 1.5 ml solution A (0.32 M sucrose, 1mM MgCl2 and 0.1mM CaCl2) with a Teflon pestle.  ~100 ?l of the homogenate was saved, solubilized with 1% SDS and clarified by centrifugation.  To prepare the [13C6]brain ISTD, 400 mg labeled MouseExpress brain tissue (Cambridge Isotopes, MA) was homogenized in 4 ml buffer A as described above, centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min to clarify, agitated on a rocker at 4?C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 20 min.  The pellet, a crude membrane fraction, was dissolved in 2 ml 20 mM Tris pH 7.4 with 1% SDS. Total protein in all preparations was quantified with the micro BCA assay (Pierce) and all solutions were supplemented with protease and phosphate inhibitor cocktails (Sigma) as well as 1 mM sodium fluoride and sodium orthovanadate (Sigma). Human cortex homogenate was mixed with the [13C6]brain ISTD (1?g/?l) at a ratio of 2:1(?g/?g) and processed for LC-MS/MS: 40 ?l preparations were heated with lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) (Invitrogen) buffer at 95?C for 20 min, separated on a 1.5 mm 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen), cut into five fractions, chopped into ?2 mm cubes, washed in 200 ?l 50% acetonitrile (ACN) containing 25 mM NH4HCO3, reduced in 300 ?l 10 mM DTT, alkylated in 300 ?l 55 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma), and digested with 80-120 ?l trypsin (.025 ?g/?l) (Promega) overnight at 37?C, so that the amount of trypsin was 1:5 of the total protein to be digested by mass.  Peptides were recovered from gel cubes into 200 ?l 50/50 H2O/ACN with 3% formic acid by vortex-mixing and sonication for 20 min each, twice. Samples were then evaporated to a 100 ?l volume, brought to 1ml in H20 with 0.1% formic acid, desalted with Oasis? HLB cartridges (Waters), evaporated almost to completion and suspended in ~ 45?l H2O with 0.1% formic acid, and filtered with 0.22 ?m Ultra free-MC filter cartridges (Millipore). LC-data dependant -MS/MS analyses were conducted on a Q Exactive (ThermoFisher Scientific) quadrupole orbi-trap hybrid instrument with an Easy nLC-II (ThermoFisher Scientific) nano-pump/autosampler.  3?l peptide sample (~ 1 ug) was loaded and resolved on a 20 cm x 75 ?m proteopepII C18 packed tip column over a 90 min gradient at a flow rate of 350 nL/min, 0-35% mobile phase B (ACN, 0.1 formic acid).  A data-dependent top 10 method was used to acquire a 70,000 resolution full scan to trigger ten 17,500 resolution HCD scans.  Ions were isolated for MS/MS analysis with a 2.0 Da window on the quadrupole.  Average cycle times were 1.2 sec.  Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Raw files from triplicate injections were searched together within Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (ThermoFisher Scientific) using SEQUEST and the human refseq. database (release 47, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/).  Search parameters allowed trypsin to cleave after Lysine and Arginine and have 2 missed cleavages.  Precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 15 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance was 20 mmu.  The dynamic modification of methionine (oxidation = 15.995 Da) and lysine (13C6 = 6.020 Da), in addition to the static modification of cysteine (carbamidomethylation = 57.021 Da) was accepted on up to 4 residues per peptide.  Within the Proteome Discoverer Software, SILAC pairs were identified using the ?2 plex? workflow node, and all peptides were rescored using the Percolator algorithm node.  Finally, peptides were filtered at 1% false discovery rate (FDR).

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GRO? was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

PXD003215	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD003215	A Novel Method for Isolating Whole Protein from Human Cranial Bone	The presence of the extracellular matrix within human bone limits the applicability of conventional protocols for protein extraction. As a result, complete and accurate characterization of human bone proteome is yet to be performed, and as a result, several bone-related diseases such as craniosynostosis and osteosarcoma are still poorly understood. We sought to develop a reproducible method for extracting whole proteins of varying molecular weights from human cranial bone. Whole protein was extracted from human cranial suture by mechanically processing samples using a method that minimized heat introduction to proteins to limit degradation. Western blotting suggests the presence of whole protein while mass spectrometry was used to sequence peptides and identify isolated proteins. Molecular weights of extracted protein ranged from 9.4-629 kDa and contained proteins of both intra- and extra-cellular origin. High correlation scores among suture protein spectral counts suggest the reproducibility of the method. Ontology analytics revealed proteins of myriad functions including mediators of metabolic processes and cell organelles. These results suggest a reproducible method for isolation of whole protein representing a large range of molecular weights, origins and functions.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson�s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation. The search result files were loaded into Pinnacle version 1.0.26.0, and the spectral library threshold settings included a Percolator q-value less than 0.05, XCorr scores above 1.5/2.0/2.2 for singly/doubly/triply charged peptides, and a Mascot Ion score > 29. Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson�s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).	17/01/2017	"[[""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201600300"",""PMID:28195392""]]"

While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

PXD003412	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD003412	Contribution of primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the hallmarks of inflammation as determined by proteome profiling - cytoplasmic proteins of untreated fibroblasts	While the most important players of inflammation have been well described, a systematic analysis of the proteins fulfilling the effector functionalities during inflammation has not yet been undertaken. Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators. The present data suggest that successful pharmacological abrogation of the formation of lipid inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts may not suffice to suppress the release of several other powerful inflammatory mediators which we thus understand to be capable of establishing chronic inflammation states.

PXD008440	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008440	The response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to 5-fluorouracil in locally advanced colorectal cancer patients: a predictive proteomic signature.	Background: Colorectal cancer is the third most common and the fourth most lethal cancer in the world. In the majority of cases, patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage or even metastatic, thus explaining the high mortality. The standard protocol for treating patients with locally advanced non-metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (NRCT) with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), but the resistance rate to this treatment remains high with approximately 30% of non-responders. The lack of evidence available in clinical practice to predict NRCT resistance to 5-FU and to guide clinical practice therefore encourages the search for biomarkers of this resistance. Methods: From twenty-three formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies performed before NRCT with 5-FU of locally advanced non-metastatic CRC patients, we extracted and analysed the tumor proteome of these patients. From clinical data, we were able to classify the twenty-two patients in our cohort into three treatment response groups: non-responders (NR), partial responders (PR) and total responders (TR), and to compare the proteomes of these different groups.  Results: We have highlighted 384 differentially expressed proteins between NR and PR, 248 between NR and TR and 417 between PR and TR. Among these proteins, we have identified many differentially expressed proteins identified as having a role in cancer (IFIT1, FASTKD2, PIP4K2B, ARID1B, SLC25A33: overexpressed in TR; CALD1, CPA3, B3GALT5, CD177, RIPK1: overexpressed in NR). We have also identified that DPYD, the main degradation enzyme of 5-FU, was overexpressed in NR, as well as several ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins also overexpressed in NR.  Conclusions: From these retrospective study, we implemented a protein extraction protocol from FFPE biopsy to highlight protein differences between different response groups to RCTN with 5-FU in patients with locally advanced non-metastatic CRC. These results will pave the way for a larger cohort for better sensitivity and specificity of the signature to guide decisions in the choice of treatment.

PXD005477	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD005477	Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Specialized Wiring of Signaling Pathways that Protects Human Regulatory T Cell Identity - 5 populations ex vivo	Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) are functionally distinct from conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs). To understand Treg identity, we compared by proteomics and transcriptomics human na�ve (n) and effector (e)Tregs, Tconvs and transitional FOXP3+ cells. Only 12% of 422 differentially expressed proteins was identified as such at the mRNA level, demonstrating the importance of direct proteome measurement. Fifty-one proteins discriminated Tregs from Tconvs. This common Treg protein signature indicates altered signaling by TCR-, TNF receptor-, NF?B-, PI3 kinase/mTOR-, NFAT- and STAT pathways, and unique cell biological and metabolic features. Another protein signature uniquely identified eTregs and revealed active cell division, apoptosis sensitivity and suppression of NF?B- and STAT signaling. eTreg fate appears consolidated by FOXP3 outnumbering its partner transcription factors. These features explain why eTregs cannot produce inflammatory cytokines, whereas transitional FOXP3+ cells can. Collectively, our data reveal that Treg identity is defined and protected by uniquely �wired� signaling pathways.

Peptides were identified using the Andromeda search engine by querying the human Uniprot database (2015-02, 89796 entries) with a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off both at peptide and protein level. Potential contaminants and reverse hits were eliminated using Perseus version 1.5.0.31. To compare proteomes of different cell populations, LFQ values were log2-transformed and the 3 technical replicates per experimental condition grouped. For further analysis, only proteins with 3 valid values in at least one of the groups were included. Missing values were imputed by normal distribution (width= 0.3, shift= 1.8). Intergroup differences in protein levels were calculated using ANOVA using Benjamini Hochberg FDR of 0.05 and S0 0. General relatedness of samples was assessed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Perseus� built-in tool. Calculation of Pearson�s correlations was assessed using Gitools (version 2.2.3)(Perez-Llamas and Lopez-Bigas, 2011). Clusters of proteins with specific expression patterns were identified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on K-means and Euclidian distance after z-score normalization. Cell type specific clusters were further analyzed for enrichment of functional and biological categories, using STRING and DAVID bioinformatics tools. Pathway diagrams were generated through the use of Ingenuity� Pathway Analysis (IPA�, QIAGEN). GO biological processes redundancy was removed using REVIGO (Supek et al., 2011).  Absolute protein abundance was estimated using the proteomic ruler approach using a plug-in built in Perseus as described by the authors (Wi?niewski et al., 2014). The abundances were expressed as protein copy numbers and the values were log10 transformed and presented in graphs using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).  Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the geneset collection C3 from the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB v4.0) that contains information about curated-, motif-, transcription factor targets gene sets. The genes that share a transcription factor binding site are defined and annotated by TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2006) (version 7.4).   Protein and RNA comparison The comparison of protein and transcript abundances across cell types was performed as published before (Wilhelm et al., 2014). Briefly, absolute transcript abundances (expressed as fragment per kilobase per million, FPKM) were extracted from the RNA-Seq data. Absolute protein abundance was estimated using the intensity based absolute protein quantification (iBAQ)(Schwanh�usser et al., 2011) approach with few modifications described elsewhere (Wilhelm et al., 2014). Briefly, peptide intensities were summed up and divided by the number of observable peptides per protein. The iBAQ values were then normalized based on the total sum of all protein intensities in order to be able to compare abundances across samples. Proteins were mapped to transcripts using the Uniprot.ws package (Bioconductor) resulting in 4,782 transcripts/proteins with expression data. For the comparison of protein and mRNA abundances, protein and transcript expression of 409 differentially expressed proteins/RNAs was z-score-transformed. All the analyses were performed using R (v 3.2.0).	15/09/2017	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.immuni.2018.04.008"",""PMID:29752063""]]"
PXD001524	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001524	Human testicular matrix -  Derivation and characterization of a cytocompatible scaffold from human testis	ITo derive a scaffold from human testis for the purpose of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, we developed a method to produce a cytocompatible decellularized testicular matrix (DTM) while maintaining the native tissue-specific characteristics and components. The potential benefits of tissue-specific scaffolds consisting of naturally-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) have been demonstrated using a wide variety of animal and human tissue sources. However, so far, testis scaffolds have never been considered for constructive remodelling purposes. We have therefore developed a protocol for the preparation of cell-free extracellular matrix and characterized the material extensively using a combination of proteomics, immunohistochemsitry, and cell population assays. To prepare cell-free matrix, human cadaveric testicular tissue was exposed for 24 h or 48 h to 1% Triton X-100 and/or 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The extent of decellularization was evaluated by histology. Confirmation of cell removal in DTM was done by a DNA quantification technique. The protein composition was analysed by LC-MS/MS. The retention of testicular tissue-specific characteristics was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, Alcian blue staining and scanning electron microscopy. Soluble toxicity and testicular cell attachment was assessed to check the cytocompatibility of DTM scaffolds.  Histological analysis showed that DTM could be obtained by mechanical agitation in 1% SDS for 24 h. The resulting DTM was found to be clear of cells while retaining the typical three-dimensional structure. Proteomics analysis revelaed the presence of  the major components of the native tissue scaffold, including collagen type I and IV, fibronectin, laminin and glycosaminoglycans. In addition, numerous additional ECM proteins in DTM were detected, indicating its complex nature. Importantly, we demonstrated that DTM scaffolds are not cytotoxic, as evidenced by MTT assay showing a normal fibroblast proliferation activity after indirect exposure, and support testicular cell attachment and infiltration.

PXD006176	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006176	Syntaxin-3 is a Weibel-Palade body localized SNARE protein that regulates Von Willebrand factor secretion from endothelial cells	Endothelial cells store von Willebrand factor (VWF) in rod-shaped secretory organelles, called Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). WPB exocytosis is coordinated by a complex network of Rab GTPases, Rab-effectors and SNARE proteins. We have previously identified STXBP1 as the link between the Rab27A-Slp4-a complex on WPBs and the SNARE proteins syntaxin-2 and -3. In this study we investigate the function of syntaxin-3 in VWF secretion. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from healthy controls endogenous syntaxin-3 immunolocalized to WPBs. A detailed analysis of BOECs isolated from a patient with variant microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), carrying a homozygous mutation in STX3 (STX3-/-), showed a loss of syntaxin-3 protein and absence of WPB-associated syntaxin-3 immunoreactivity. Ultrastructural analysis revealed no detectable differences in morphology or prevalence of immature or mature WPBs in control versus STX3-/- BOECs. VWF multimer analysis showed normal patterns in plasma of the MVID patient, and media from STX3-/- BOECs, together indicating WPB formation and maturation are unaffected by absence of syntaxin-3. However, a clear defect in Ca2+ and cAMP-mediated VWF secretion was found in the STX3-/- BOECs. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that syntaxin-3 associates with the WPB SNAREs SNAP23 and VAMP8. Our data reveal syntaxin-3 as a novel WPB-associated SNARE controlling VWF secretion and highlight the complex regulation of WPB exocytosis by multiple SNARE complexes.

Global changes in protein levels were assessed employing four separate volcano plots where the syntaxin-3 patient BOECs were pair wise compared with the healthy control BOECs (FDR 0.05, S0: 0.4). Proteins with a significantly changed level were defined as proteins with a significantly changed expression in all four pair wise comparisons. References 3.

PXD001417	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001417	Comprehensive Assessment of Proteins Regulated by Dexamethasone Reveals Novel Effects in Primary Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells - secreted proteins of untreated cells	Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GRO? was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

Here, we demonstrate the adsorption of plasma protein onto BP nanomaterials and the subsequent immune perturbation effect on macrophages. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we discovered that BP nanosheets (BPNSs) were able to bind 23.3 percent of immune proteins from plasma, while BP quantum dots (BPQDs) bound 41.8 percent of immune proteins. In particular, the protein corona dramatically reshaped BP nanomaterial-corona complexes, influenced cellular uptake, activated the NF-?B pathway and even increased cytokine secretion by 2-5-fold. BP nanomaterials induced immunotoxicity and immune perturbation in macrophages in the presence of a plasma corona. These findings offer important insights into the development of safe and effective BP nanomaterial-based therapies.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGF? or IL-1?, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGF? in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.

Identification of high grade CIN lesions by population-based screening programs and their subsequent treatment has led to a significant reduction of the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. Cytology-based testing of cervical smears is the most widely used cervical cancer screening method, but is not ideal, as the sensitivity for detection of CIN2 and higher (CIN2+) is only ~55%. Therefore, more sensitive and specific biomarkers for cervical cancer and its precancerous stages are needed.

Our goal is to develop new predictive tools of nephropathy starting from urine, which can be easily obtained using noninvasive procedures and it is directly related to kidney. In this study, urine from children with recent diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was subjected to proteomic analysis in comparison to age-matched controls. Targeted confirmation was performed on children with a longer history of diabetes using Western Blotting and applying a urinary lipidomic approach. To definitively understand whether the observed alterations could be related to diabetic nephropathy, urine from diabetic adults with or without albuminuria, which is an indication of nephropathy, was also examined. Our results showed that lipid metabolisms of prostaglandin and ceramide, which are significantly and specifically modified in association with DN, are already altered in children with a recent diabetes diagnosis.

PXD008996	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008996	Impact of biomechanical stimulation in the toxicity of deoxynivalenol in A431 cells: impairment of �dynamic� cell functions	Morphology together with the capability to respond to surrounding stimuli are the key elements governing the spatial interaction of a living cell with the environment. In this respect, biomechanical stimulation can trigger significant physiological cascades that can potentially modulate or interact with toxicity. Deoxynivalenol (DON, vomitoxin) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins produced by Fusarium spp. and it was used to explore the delicate interaction between biomechanical stimulation and cytotoxic processes in A431 cells. In fact, in addition of being a well-known food contaminant, DON is becoming a relevant toxin also for other organ systems. The combination between biomechanical stimulation and the mycotoxin revealed how DON can impair crucial functions like cellular morphology and lysosome trafficking at concentrations far below those known to be cytotoxic in routine toxicity studies. Moreover, sub-toxic concentrations of DON (0.1-1 ?M) impaired the capability of A431 cells to respond to a biomechanical stimulation that normally sustains trophic effects in this cell line. Ultimately, the effects of DON (0.1-10 ?M) were partially modulated by the application of uniaxial stretching (0.5Hz, 24h, 15% deformation) suggesting a deep cross-talk between the cytotoxic potential of the mycotoxin and the biomechanical stimulation.

PXD008029	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008029	An adaptive pipeline to maximize isobaric tagging data in large-scale MS-based proteomics	Isobaric tagging is a method of choice in Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics for comparing multiple conditions at a time. Despite its multiplexing capabilities, when multiple experiments are merged for comparison in large sample-size studies, some drawbacks appears, due to the presence of missing values, which result from the stochastic nature of the Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode. Another indirect cause of data incompleteness might derive from the proteomic-typical data processing workflow that first identifies proteins in individual experiments and then only quantifies those identified proteins, leaving a large number of unmatched spectra with quantitative information unexploited.  Inspired by untargeted metabolomic and label-free proteomic workflows, we developed a quantification-driven bioinformatic pipeline (Quantify then Identify � QtI) that optimizes the processing of isobaric Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) data from large-scale studies. This pipeline includes innovative modules, such as the Peptide Match Rescue (PMR) and the Optimized Post-Translational Modification (OPTM) and outperforms a classical benchmark workflow in terms of quantification and identification rates, significantly reducing missing data while preserving unmatched features for quantitative comparison. The number of unexploited tandem mass spectra was reduced by 77% and 62% for two human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma datasets, respectively.

PXD006776	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006776	Proteome Profiling Identifies Markers for Inflammation-Related Tumor-Fibroblast Interaction in Colorectal Cancer	Inflammation has been identified as an important factor in cancer development and progression, including colorectal cancer [CRC]. To determine the role of inflammation and the specific contribution of activated fibroblasts in cancer development and progression we analyzed six human CRC tissue specimens and paired normal adjacent mucosa samples by LS/MS-MS. Amongst other, indeed several inflammation associated proteins were found differentially expressed compared to normal colonic mucosa. Two candidate molecules, SPARC and THBS2 were recently identified as proteins of a fibroblast inflammation signature. Analysis of public available RNA expression datasets revealed, that the mRNA of both SPARC and THBS2 are upregulated in CRC, typically in association with the CRC consensus molecular subtype 4 [CMS4]. Immunohistochemistry staining also demonstrated upregulation of SPARC and THBS2 in the tumor stroma compared to normal adjacent mucosa and indicated co-localization with the mesenchymal marker [alpha]SMA. In vitro 3D co-culture experiments with human colon derived fibroblasts and CRC cell lines resulted in enhanced SPARC and THBS2 protein levels when both cell types were cultivated in direct physical contact, compared to fibroblasts or cancer cells alone. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting tumor-specific signatures by LC-MS/MS and compatibility with RNA expression datasets. We identified an inflammation signature in CRC tissue and the data emphasized the contribution of activated fibroblasts in these events.

PXD008205	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008205	Contractile work contributes to maturation of energy metabolism in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes	Energy metabolism is a key aspect of cardiomyocyte biology. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are a promising tool for biomedical application, but they are immature and have not undergone metabolic shift related to early postnatal development. Cultivation of hiPSC-CM in 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) format leads to morphological maturation. This study compared the mitochondrial and metabolic state of hiPSC-CM in standard 2D culture and the EHT format and determined the influence of contractile activity. HiPSC-CM in EHTs showed ~2-fold higher number of mitochondria (electron microscopy), mitochondrial mass (mitotracker), DNA (Mt-ND1, Mt-ND2), and protein abundance (proteome) than in 2D culture. While hiPSC-CM exhibited the principal ability to use glucose, lactate and fatty acids as energy substrates irrespective of culture format, hiPSC-CM in 3D performed more oxidation of glucose, lactate and fatty acid, and less anaerobic glycolysis. The increase in mitochondrial mass and DNA in 3D was diminished by pharmacological inhibition of contractile force, suggesting that contractile work participates in mitochondrial development hiPSC-CM. In conclusion, contractile work in the EHT format contributes to metabolic maturation of hiPSC-CM.

The resulting data file was loaded into the Scaffold software (version scaffold_4.3.4, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA) to filter and quantify the peptides and proteins. For protein identification, filters were set to a 90% protein probability threshold and a 90% peptide probability threshold, which resulted in a final decoy FDR of less than 0.1%. For protein identification, at least 2 peptides per protein had to be recognized. Data analysis and clustering was performed in the Scaffold software. In general, relative quantification was done in a label-free approach by the setting Quantitative Value (Normalized Total Spectra). For comparison, the total number of spectral counts identified for each proteins were visualized and compared to the counterpart. For statistical analysis only proteins identified in 3/3 samples were used for comparative analysis. For a quantitative analysis of specifically unique peptides to precisely distinguish between protein isoforms, the measured peak areas from Proteome Discoverer were analyzed using Scaffold and the Multiplex Quantitation method. Protein FDR was set to 1.0% and Peptide FDR to 0.1% with a minimum of 2 peptides. Quantitative analysis was performed by adjusting the reference group to the 2D samples. To display the comparison the setting was adjusted to fold change ratio. No minimal fold change threshold was applied.	14/11/2017	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.stemcr.2018.01.039"",""PMID:29503093""]]"
PXD001985	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001985	CF sputum LC-MSMS -  Proteomic profile of cystic fibrosis sputum cells in adults chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Lung disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), and involves chronic infection by a destructive microbiota and perturbed innate and adaptive immune responses. Tissue damage is considered to be mediated mostly by proteases, but other bacterial and host factors may also play a role. To determine the presence of potentially injurious proteins we employed semi-quantitative Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology to identify sputum cellular proteins with consistently altered expression in CF compared to healthy controls. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, Gene Ontology functions, protein abundance and correlation with lung function were used to infer their clinical significance. The CF proteome exhibited differential expression of proteins relating to Rho family small GTPase activity, immune cell movement and activation, generation of reactive oxygen species and dysregulation of cell death and proliferation. Compositional breakdown established neutrophil extracellular trap proteins as the consistently most abundant cellular proteins detected, while a further 13 biologically relevant proteins were found to correlate negatively with lung function. These findings expand the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying CF lung disease and identify sputum cell proteins which might be useful as markers of disease status, prognostic indicators, stratification determinants for treatment prescription or as therapeutic targets.

PXD002211	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD002211	Quantification of cytokines secreted by primary human cells using MRM: evaluation of analytical parameters � shotgun secretome data of inflammatory stimulated HUVECs	The determination of secreted proteins may provide highly valuable information about cell functions. While the typical methods for the determination of biologically relevant but low-abundant molecular species still relies on the use of specific antibodies, mass spectrometry-based methods are now gaining sufficient sensitivity to cope with such challenges. In the current study we have identified several cytokines and chemokines which were induced by inflammatory activation of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Based on the high-resolution mass spectrometry data obtained with a Q Exactive orbitrap, we built an MRM method to quantify the most relevant molecules selected from the screening experiment. Using nano-flow Chip-HPLC coupled to a 6490 triple-quadrupole MS for MRM analyses we achieved calibration curves covering a linear range of four orders of magnitude and detection limits in the low attomol per microliter concentration range. Carryover was consistently less than 0.005%, the accuracy between 80% and 120% and the median coefficient of variation for LC/MS was only 2.2%. When including the variance introduced by biological replicates and the digestion procedure, the coefficient of variation was less than 20% for most peptides. Selection of appropriate marker molecules allowed us to monitor typical cell culture variations such as different cell densities, proliferative states and the occurrence of cell death. As a result, here we present a robust and efficient MRM-based assay for the accurate and sensitive determination of cytokines and chemokines representative for functional cell states and including comprehensive quality controls.

PXD007745	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007745	Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Specialized Wiring of Signaling Pathways that Protects Human Regulatory T Cell Identity - 2 populations in vitro	Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) are functionally distinct from conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs). To understand Treg identity, we compared by proteomics and transcriptomics human na�ve (n) and effector (e)Tregs, Tconvs and transitional FOXP3+ cells. Only 12% of 422 differentially expressed proteins was identified as such at the mRNA level, demonstrating the importance of direct proteome measurement. Fifty-one proteins discriminated Tregs from Tconvs. This common Treg protein signature indicates altered signaling by TCR-, TNF receptor-, NF?B-, PI3 kinase/mTOR-, NFAT- and STAT pathways, and unique cell biological and metabolic features. Another protein signature uniquely identified eTregs and revealed active cell division, apoptosis sensitivity and suppression of NF?B- and STAT signaling. eTreg fate appears consolidated by FOXP3 outnumbering its partner transcription factors. These features explain why eTregs cannot produce inflammatory cytokines, whereas transitional FOXP3+ cells can. Collectively, our data reveal that Treg identity is defined and protected by uniquely �wired� signaling pathways.

PXD006570	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006570	Aging-related proteome alterations in B cells may predispose for chronic lymphocytic leukemia - cytoplasmic proteins of elderly B cells	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of leukemia in adults, is still incurable despite the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

PXD002990	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD002990	Complementary Phosphoproteomic Approaches Link IL-23R Downstream Signaling with Metabolic Adaptation in Lymphocytes	Interleukin (IL)-23 mediated signal transduction represents a major molecular mechanism underlying the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In addition, emerging evidence supports the role of IL-23-driven Th17 cells in inflammation. Components of the IL-23 signalling pathway, such as IL23R, JAK2 and STAT3, have been characterised, but elements unique to this network as compared to other interleukins have not been readily addressed. In this study, we have undertaken a multi-stage phosphoproteomics approach to better characterise downstream signalling events. To this end, we performed and compared phosphopeptide and phosphoprotein enrichment methodologies after activation of T lymphocytes by IL-23. We demonstrate the complementary nature of the two phosphor-enrichment approaches by maximising the capture of phosphorylation events. A total of 8069 unique phosphopeptides (containing 8344 unique sites), and 4317 unique phosphorylated proteins were identified, amongst which STAT3, PKM2, CDK6 and LASP-1 clearly showed induction of specific phosphorylation sites that were not readily observed after IL-2 stimulation. Interestingly, we observed subsequent translocation of STAT3 and PKM2 to the nucleus as well as increased phosphorylation especially of the nuclear portion at ~30 min after IL-23 stimulation, suggesting a wide range of cellular responses including proliferation and metabolic adaptation.

Cells within one experiment were taken from the same culture. Cells for experiments A and B were from the same batch and equal passage number, cells for experiment C were a separate batch with same passage number. All batches originated from cells frozen on the same date and stored in liquid nitrogen. Unstimulated/stimulated samples were digested as described above and the peptides labelled with two different dimethyl labels per the table below; note the inverted label strategy between dataset A and datasets B and C. Analysis of the MS data for these phosphopeptide datasets was performed using Proteome Discoverer v1.4 (PD, Thermo Scientific) and the default Dimethylation 2plex method.

Precursor quantitation settings were Mass Precision = 3 ppm, S/N Threshold = 1, RT Tolerance of Isotope Pattern Multiplets = 1 min, Single-Peak/Missing Channels Allowed = 1, Replace Missing Quan Values With Minimum Intensity = True. The results were initially filtered in PD according to the following parameters - quantify unique peptides only, Maximum Fold Change = 10000, Minimum Quantitation Value threshold = 0.1, Mascot cut-off value = 20, false discovery rate = 1 %, Peptide Grouping disabled, Protein Grouping enabled (using Strict Maximum Parsimony Principle). The list was refined to select only phosphopeptides, exported as .csv and further filtered in Excel to select Search Rank = 1, Unambiguous (allowing for protein grouping) peptides.  For each phosphopeptide, in cases of multiple data points due to multi-modal elution profiles or different charge states, the example with the highest mean abundance across both conditions was taken.  These final quantitation values for unique phosphopeptides are shown in the filtered data tabs of Table S1. Finally, stimulated/unstimulated ratios were normalised to correct for mixing error by dividing all values by the median of all peptides exported from PD (normalisation factor for datasets: A: 1.10, B: 1.14, C: 0.95).	30/09/2015	"[[""DOI:10.1038/srep24491"",""PMID:27080861""]]"

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GRO? was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

PXD010690	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010690	Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid via data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the brain and serves as a valuable specimen to examine diseases of the central nervous system through analyzing its components. These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.

PXD009021	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009021	Proteomic Analysis of Human Liver Reference Material	Recent advances in mass spectrometric (MS) instruments resulting in high mass resolution and high duty cycles have allowed of very deep coverage of proteomes. However, even with state of the art, high duty cycle instruments, the number of proteins identified with a conventional single liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC/MS/MS) analysis is typically limited and fractionating protein samples prior to LC/MS/MS analysis is crucial for increasing both the analytical dynamic range and proteome coverage.  In order to achieve near comprehensive identification of proteomes two-dimensional (2D) chromatography has been an invaluable tool.  This first dimension is typically performed with �L/min flow and relatively large column inner diameters, which allow efficient pre-fractionation but typically require peptide amounts in the milligram range while the second dimension is typically performed with nL/min flow rates and capillary columns with small inner diameters. Typically, reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) provides high peak resolution of peptides and achieves higher peak capacities than strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) due to the faster chromatographic partitioning. Another advantage of RPLC is that the mobile phases used generate much cleaner samples for downstream analyses, while the incorporation of a desalting step for SCX in order to eliminated the high salt concentrations that can significantly decrease the analytical sensitivity of the MS analysis due to ionization problems. When operated at widely different pH values (e.g., 1st dimension pH 10 and 2nd dimension pH 3) 2D RPLC-RPLC provides separation orthogonality comparable to that of the combination of SCX-RPLC. The difference of separation selectivity between the low and high pH (HpH) RPLC comes from the changes in the charge distribution within peptide chains upon altering pH of the eluent.  Herein we describe a method in which tryptic peptides are separated in the first dimension by HpH-RPLC and fractions are collected every 90 s over an 80 min gradient. For the second dimension, each of these fractions is individually run by the standard low pH RPLC method. The implementation of the HpH pre-fractionation allows for short second dimension gradients for bottom up LC/MS/MS and yields very deep (e.g. thousands of identifications) protein coverage at reasonable measurement time.

PXD006571	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006571	Aging-related proteome alterations in B cells may predispose for chronic lymphocytic leukemia - nuclear proteins of elderly B cells	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of leukemia in adults, is still incurable despite the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

PXD001420	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001420	Comprehensive Assessment of Proteins Regulated by Dexamethasone Reveals Novel Effects in Primary Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells - secreted proteins of inflammatory stimulated cells	Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GRO? was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms.

PXD002883	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD002883	Combined assessment of global proteome, phosphoproteome and N-terminal protein cleavage to characterize altered platelet functions in human Scott syndrome	The Scott syndrome is a rare bleeding disorder associated with a mutation in the gene encoding anoctamin-6 (TMEM16F). After stimulation of Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, syndromatic platelets show a reduced phosphatidylserine exposure and do not form membrane blebs. Given the central role of anoctamin-6 in the platelet procoagulant response, we used quantitative proteomics to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and the complex phenotypic changes in Scott platelets compared to control platelets. Therefore, we applied an iTRAQ-based multi-pronged strategy to quantify changes in (i) the global proteome, (ii) the phosphoproteome and (iii) proteolytic events between resting and stimulated Scott and control platelets.  Our data indicate a limited number of proteins with decreased (70) or increased (64) expression in Scott platelets, among those we observed the absence of anoctamin-6 and the strong up-regulation of aquaporin-1. Furthermore, the quantification of 1,566 phosphopeptides revealed major differences between Scott and control platelets after stimulation with thrombin/convulxin or ionomycin. Finally, we quantified 1,596 N-terminal peptides in activated Scott and control platelets, 180 of which we identified as calpain-regulated, whereas a distinct set of 23 neo-N-termini was caspase-regulated. In Scott platelets, calpain-induced cleavage of cytoskeleton-linked and signaling proteins was down-regulated, in accordance with an increased phosphorylation state. Thus, multi-pronged proteomic profiling of Scott platelets provides detailed insight into their protection against detrimental Ca2+-dependent changes that are normally associated with phosphatidylserine exposure.

Raw data were processed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 and 1.3 respectively (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Thus, data were searched against the Uniprot human database, Mascot and Sequest were used as search algorithms with the following settings: (i) trypsin as enzyme allowing two missed cleavages, (ii) iTRAQ 8-plex at N-termini and lysines and carbamidomethylation of Cys residues as fixed modifications, (iii) oxidation of methionine as variable modification, (iv) mass tolerances for MS and MS/MS were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. False discovery rate (FDR) estimation on the level of peptide spectrum matches was performed using the peptide validator node with filtering for 1% FDR (high confidence filter). The reporter ion quantifier node was used for iTRAQ reporter quantification. For the phosphoproteome analysis, phosphorylation of Ser/Thr/Tyr (+79.9663 Da) was set as variable modification furthermore, for localization of phosphorylated sites phospho-RS was used.For the global proteome only unique proteins quantified with at least 2 unique peptides were considered. Next, normalization factors were determinate and used to compensate for individual systematic errors (i.e. unequal sample amounts derived from pipetting errors or inaccurate BCA results) and to obtain normalized ratios. In addition, all data was scaled to obtain normalized abundance per iTRAQ channel. For the phosphoproteome, the obtained normalization factors from the global proteome were used to normalize the data and it was as well scaled to obtain normalized abundances. Furthermore, only phosphopeptides with phospho-RS probabilities >90% were considered as confident. Thus, for determination of confident phosphorylation sites at the peptide and protein level a ready-to-use Excel macro provided by Mechtler lab (http://ms.imp.ac.at/?goto=phosphors) was used. Additionally, label free quantification was performed using the Progenesis LC-MS software version 4.1 from Nonlinear Dynamics in combination with SearchGUI 2.8.1 and PeptideShaker 1.19.2.The following search parameters were used: (i) trypsin as protease with a maximum of two missed cleavages, (ii) carbamidomethylation of Cys as fixed, and (iii) oxidation of Met as variable modification. MS and MS/MS tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da. For all proteins, ratios between Scott and control platelets were calculated based on normalized areas obtained from Progenesis and log2-transformed. Regulations factors in both cases were as 2x SD of the normal distributed data. Finally, generated raw data from ChaFRADIC were searched against the human Uniprot database using Proteome Discoverer version 1.4 and Mascot 2.4 as search engine, reporter ion quantifier and percolator nodes. Enzyme specificities were set to semi-Arg-C, as Lys residues were blocked by iTRAQ labeling. To enable the quantification of two classes of N-terminal peptides, i.e. those with N-terminal iTRAQ label and those with endogenous N-acetylation, a two-step search strategy was performed. First, data were searched with iTRAQ-8plex (+304.2053 Da) as fixed modification at Lys and peptide N-termini; second, iTRAQ 8plex of Lys and N-terminal acetylation (+ 42.0105 Da) of N-termini were set as fixed modifications. In both cases, carbamidomethylation of Cys (+57.0214 Da) was selected as fixed and oxidation (+15.9949 Da) of methionine as variable modification. Mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm for MS and 0.02 Da for MS/MS. Identified peptides were filtered for high confidence corresponding to an FDR <1% at the PSM level, and a search engine rank of 1. The reporter ion quantifier node was adjusted according to the search settings. Quantification of N-terminal peptides across samples and conditions were essentially done as described for the phosphoproteome data. Sample set 2 was used to validate potential Calpain substrates. Therefore, the following ratios were determined: (i) ionomycin / unstimulated (ion effect); (ii) ionomycin+calpeptin / unstimulated (effect calpain inhibition); (iii) ionomycin+QVD-OPh / unstimulated (effect caspase inhibition)., (iv) ABT737 / unstimulated (ABT effect), (v)  ABT737+QVD-OPh / unstimulated (effect caspase inhibition), (vi) ABT737+calpeptin/ unstimulated (effect calpain inhibition). Sample set 1 was used to identify differential proteolytic cleavage between Scott and healthy platelets which we hypothesized to partially derive from Calpain activity. Therefore, for Set 1 only N-terminal peptides which were in agreement with the consensus motif (previously defined by an in vitro digestion of purified platelets platelets with recombinant calpain) showing a fold change between conditions were considered as regulated.	12/04/2016	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:27535140""]]"

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GRO? was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

PXD009754	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009754	LC-MSMS of the lc4 MHC class I immunopeptidome	MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

The present study establishes an in-depth CSF proteome through the analysis of a unique CSF sample from a pool of healthy donors. After immuno-affinity depletion, the CSF sample was fractionated using off-gel electrophoresis and analyzed with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MS) using the latest generation of hybrid Orbitrap mass spectrometers. The shotgun proteomic analysis allowed the identification of 20689 peptides mapping on 3379 proteins. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained dataset constitutes the largest CSF proteome published so far. Among the CSF proteins identified, 34% correspond to genes defined as elevated in the brain by The Human Protein Atlas.

PXD010698	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010698	Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid via data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the brain and serves as a valuable specimen to examine diseases of the central nervous system through analyzing its components. These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The goal of this study was to determine markers of HF in African Americans, using plasma samples collected before the development of symptoms. We propose that early plasma glycoprotein changes will link to later development of heart failure.  ApolipoproteinF will be the strongest indicator. METHODS: Plasma samples from a subset of Jackson Heart Study participants with a history of MI but without prevalent heart failure (HF) at visit 2 (2005-2008) were analyzed by glycoproteomics. Individuals were grouped into those who experienced subsequent HF hospitalization after visit 2 (n=15; 3 men/ 12 women) and those without HF hospitalization through 2012 (n=45; 24 men/ 21 women). N-linked plasma glycopeptides were quantified by solid-phase extraction coupled to mass spectrometry and identified using RefSeq and SwissProt.

Although this information could help guiding the management of PD patients, little is known about the potential of PDE to define pathomechanism-associated molecular signatures in PD. Here we present the utilization of a high-performance multiplex proteomics approach based on depletion of highly abundant plasma proteins and enrichment of low abundance proteins and quantitation using a combination of label-free and isobaric labeling strategies for PDE samples from PD patients (n=20), who received either standard PD fluid or a novel PD fluid (added alanyl-glutamine (AlaGln)) in an open-label, randomized, two-period, cross-over clinical trial.

The resultant peak lists was searched against the human SwissProt database version v2013.01_20130110 (37398 sequences, including isoforms as obtained from varsplic.pl) with the search engines Mascot (v2.3.02, MatrixScience, London, U.K.) and Phenyx (v2.5.14, GeneBio, Geneva, Switzerland). Submission to the search engines was via a Perl script that performs an initial search with relatively broad mass tolerances (Mascot only) on both the precursor and fragment ions (�10 ppm and �0.6 Da, respectively). High-con?dence peptide identi?cations were used to recalibrate all precursor and fragment ion masses prior to a second search with narrower mass tolerances (�4 ppm and �0.025 Da). One missed tryptic cleavage site was allowed. Carbamidomethyl cysteine, N-terminal, and lysine-modi?ed TMT 6plex were set as ?xed modi?cations, and oxidized methionine was set as a variable modi?cation. To validate the proteins, Mascot and Phenyx output ?les were processed by internally developed parsers. Proteins with ?2 unique peptides above a score T1 or with a single peptide above a score T2 were selected as unambiguous identi?cations. Additional peptides for these validated proteins with score >T3 were also accepted. For Mascot and Phenyx, T1, T2, and T3 were equal to 16, 40, 10 and 5.5, 9.5, 3.5, respectively (p-value <10?3). Following the selection criteria, proteins were grouped on the basis of shared peptides, and only the group reporters are considered in the ?nal output of identi?ed proteins. Spectral con?icts between Mascot and Phenyx peptide identi?cations were discarded. The whole procedure was repeated against a reversed database to assess the protein group false discovery rate (FDR). Peptide and protein group identi?cations were <0.1 and <1% FDR, respectively. Identified keratins (n=18) were only excluded from the results if containing the terms �hair� or �cuticular� as cytokeratins are markers of mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal wall.  TMT Semiquantitative Analysis The R software package Isobar (Breitwieser et al., J Prot Res 2011) was used to calculate protein ratios. Isobar is publically available under the LGPL license from the CeMM Web site (http://bioinformatics.cemm.oeaw. ac.at) and through Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/ packages/release/bioc/html/isobar.html). Isobar implements a signal intensity noise model to account for heteroscedasticity in TMT reporter ion ratios and calculates p values for each quantitated protein estimating technical and biological variability. The statistical framework of Isobar was described previously (Breitwieser et al., J Prot Res 2011). TMT reporter ions were extracted at the expected m/z � 0.005 m/z, and intensities were corrected for isotopic impurities, as supplied by the manufacturer. All channels were normalized to equal sum of intensities. Protein identi?cations were grouped based on peptide matches from both samples. Protein ratios were calculated based on unique peptides. Proteins were denoted as signi?cantly regulated (in one sample) when the ratio p value was <0.05, and the protein also had a ratio >2.5 times the median absolute deviation from the median. For further analysis, proteins were selected that were signi?cant in one or both samples and showed the same direction of change with a ratio p value of <0.05 in both samples. A protein was also selected if there was a signi?cant change in one sample only.	28/09/2017	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra117.000186"",""PMID:29208752""]]"

The results of multiple iTRAQ LC-MS/MS experiments were aligned to compare protein-level quantitative data using Protein Alignment Template vs. 2.00p (AB Sciex) [30]. The Protein Alignment Template provides the overlap of proteins across multiple iTRAQ LC MS/MS experiments by matching proteins in a �reference master list� to the �test list� of proteins identified in each individual iTRAQ LC-MS/MS run.  For this alignment, we created a reference master list by performing a database search using .RAW files from two iTRAQ LC-MS/MS experiments i.e. iTRAQ experiment 1 and 5. To ensure that the proteins in this list are of high ID quality, we used a local FDR ? 5% as a threshold for the reference protein list. As per the recommendation of the Protein Alignment Template, for assembling of feature table with quantitative values, the threshold of ? 5% global FDR was used for �test list� consisting of individual sets for the five-iTRAQ LC-MS/MS experiments. The Protein Alignment Template resulted in aligning of the ratios, p-values and error factors of the proteins across replicate experiments by using accession numbers of isoforms within protein summary and UniProt database.	29/06/2015	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.bbmt.2016.04.021"",""PMID:27155584""]]"

Here, we have performed a metaproteomic analysis of 103 stool samples from subjects that either had recent-onset T1D, were high-risk autoantibody positive or low-risk autoantibody negative relatives of individuals with beta cell autoimmunity or healthy individuals to identify signatures in host and microbial proteins associated with disease risk. Multivariate modelling analysis demonstrated that both human host proteins and microbial derived proteins could be used to differentiate new-onset and seropositive individuals from low-risk and healthy controls. Significant alterations were identified between subjects with T1D or islet autoimmunity versus autoantibody negative and control subjects in the prevalence of individual host proteins associated with exocrine pancreas function, inflammation and mucosal function. Data integrationIntegrative analysis combining the metaproteomic data with bacterial abundance showed that taxa that were depleted in new-onset T1D patients were positively associated with host proteins involved in maintaining function of the mucous barrier, microvilli adhesion and exocrine pancreas. These data support the notion that T1D patients have increased intestinal inflammation and decreased barrier function. They also confirmed that pancreatic exocrine dysfunction occurs in new-onset T1D patients and show for the first time that this dysfunction is present in high-risk individuals prior to disease onset. Our data has identified a unique T1D-associated signature in stool that may be useful as a means to monitor disease progression or response to therapies aimed at restoring a healthy microbiota.

PXD009196	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009196	Exercise-induced molecular mechanisms for glycogen supercompensation in human skeletal muscle	A single bout of exercise followed by intake of carbohydrates leads to glycogen supercompensation in the prior exercised muscle. The molecular mechanisms underlying this well-known phenomenon remain elusive. Here we report that a single bout of exercise induces marked activation of glycogen synthase (GS) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) for several days beyond normalized muscle glycogen content in man. Acute muscle specific deletion of AMPK activity in mouse muscle abrogated the ability for glycogen supercompensation, providing genetic evidence that AMPK serves as essential driver for glycogen supercompensation. Muscle proteomic analyses revealed elevated glucose uptake capacity in the prior exercised muscle while key proteins in fat oxidation and glycolysis largely remained unchanged. The temporal order of these sustained cellular alterations induced by a single bout of exercise provide a mechanism to offset the otherwise tight feedback inhibition of glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake by glycogen, ultimately leading to muscle glycogen supercompensation.

Identification of such biomarkers has hitherto been unsuccessful over a range of studies using different methods. The present study used an alternative proteomic approach to find new, potential plasma AAA biomarker candidates. Pre-fractionated plasma samples from twelve patients with AAA and eight matched controls without aneurysm were analyzed by mass spectrometry applying a tandem mass tag (TMT) technique. Eight proteins were differentially regulated in patients compared to controls, including decreased levels of the enzyme bleomycin hydrolase. The down-regulation of this enzyme was confirmed in an extended validation study using an ELISA assay. The TMT-based proteomic approach thus identified novel potential plasma biomarkers for AAA.

A database search for each set was performed with the Mascot search engine version 2.3 (Matrix Science LTD., London, United Kingdom) using the UniProtKB/Trembl database (downloaded 2012-11-19, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Switzerland) with MS peptide tolerance of 10 ppm and MS/MS tolerance of 100 millimass units (mmu). Tryptic peptides were accepted with one missed cleavage and variable modifications of methionine oxidation, cysteine methylthiolation and fixed modifications of N-terminal TMT6plex and lysine TMT6plex were selected.  The detected peptide threshold in the software was set to 1% False Discovery Rate by searching against a reversed database and the corresponding result was filtered by selecting proteins with at least one unique peptide per protein. Identified proteins were grouped by sharing the same sequences to minimize redundancy. For TMT quantification, the ratios of the TMT reporter ion intensities in MS/MS spectra ([M+H]+ m/z 126-131) from raw data sets were used to calculate fold changes between samples. The ratios were derived by Proteome Discoverer version 1.3 using the following criteria: fragment ion tolerance as 100 mmu for the most confident centroid peak, TMT reagent purity corrections factors were used and missing values were replaced with minimum intensity. Only peptides unique for a given protein were considered for relative quantitation, excluding those common to other isoforms or proteins of the same family. The quantification was normalized using the protein median.	9/10/2018	"[[""DOI:10.3390/proteomes6040043"",""PMID:30340394""]]"

Here, we identified the extracellular matrix protein Nidogen-1 (NID1) as a ligand of NKp44, an important activating receptor expressed by activated NK cells. When released as soluble molecule, NID1 can regulate NK cell function by modulating NKp44-induced IFN-? production or cytotoxicity.  We also show that NID1 may be present at the cell surface. In this form or when bound to a solid support (bNID1), NID1 failed to induce NK cell cytotoxicity or cytokine release. However, analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that exposure to bNID1 can induce relevant changes in the proteomic profiles suggesting an effect on different, biological processes of human NK cells.

There is no current treatment; instead, disease management targets the main symptoms (pain and stiffness) and culminates in joint replacement surgery. OA is a disease of cartilage degeneration, but the molecular changes leading to the development of OA are still poorly understood. In this study we compare methylation, gene transcription and protein abundance at the genome-wide level in individually-matched samples of chondrocytes extracted from affected and relatively healthy articular cartilage across 12 OA patients undergoing total knee replacement. Integration analysis highlights genes that are consistently affected at multiple levels, including AQP1, CLEC3B and COL1A1, and also relevant biological pathways such as extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolism and proteolysis. Collectively these results provide a first view of the comprehensive molecular landscape underpinning OA development and point to potential therapeutic avenues.

The search criteria were: full tryptic specificity was required; two missed cleavage sites were allowed; oxidation of methionine, 13C(6)15N(2) at lysine, 13C(6) at arginine, and acetylation of protein N-terminus were set as variable modifications; carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as the fixed modification; and precursor ion mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm for all MS and 20 mmu for all MS2 spectra. Peptide false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated using the percolator function provided by Proteome Discoverer, with a cutoff score of 1% based on decoy database searching. Proteome Discoverer Searching Algorithm was used for protein quantification. Briefly, relative protein expression ratios were calculated using the peak area of Lys0Arg0 divided by the peak area of Lys8Arg6. Only peptides assigned to a given protein group were considered unique. Proteins with two or more unique peptide matches were regarded as confident identifications and further quantified. Differences in protein abundance between sample and control groups were calculated by averaging unique peptide ratios for that protein.

This study presents a look at the individuality of the metaproteomes from 22 medieval Danish dental calculus samples. The proteomics data suggest two distinct groups; a healthy and disease-susceptible. Comparison to modern healthy calculus samples supports this hypothesis. The osteological inspections of the samples does not immediately support the grouping made by proteomics data, making us believe that this will add a new and exciting level of information. We identify 3671 protein-groups across all medieval samples and thus expanding the depth of previous studies more than ten times. As a part of future perspective for further depth in these types of samples we performed offline high pH fractionation in combination with TMT labelling and achieved ~30% more protein identifications and reduced costly mass spectrometry time.

The aim was to increase peptide and protein identifications, while controlling false positives in a conservative manner. Therefore, we stratified the search space into three uneven groups, namely �human�, �bacteria�, and �other� (consisting of all �other� taxa such as food remains and peptides not mapped to kingdom level). FDR calculations were performed separately within each of these groups at the peptide level using the peptides.txt file from MaxQuant output. The FDR was calculated analogous to Cox & Mann, 2008 as follows. In order to determine a cutoff score for a specific FDR, all peptide identifications - from the forward and the reverse database - were sorted by their Andromeda-score in descending order. Peptides were accepted until 1% of reverse hits/forward hits has accumulated. In order to work with MaxQuants LFQ intensities we used the remaining �Leading razor proteins� identifiers from the peptides.txt to map and filter the proteinGroups.txt file through the �Protein IDs� column.

Nakai is a variety of biological activities of medicinal plants, and the active component such as polysaccharides or alkaloids, also proved to have the effect of anti-tumor, anti-virus, anti-radiation, anti-oxidation and anti-infection. In this study, we examined the inhibition of three polysaccharide fractions from Viscum coloratum (Kom.) Nakai on HepG2 cells growth in a dose-dependent manner using CCK-8 kit assay, and flow cytometry analysis showed that VCP2 delayed cell cycle in G1 phase and induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells which may due to overexpressed p21Wafl/Cip1 and Cyclin D and decreased expressions of Cyclin E and CDK4, and the upregulated Bad, Smac and Caspase-3 and the downregulated Bcl-XL and XIAP may be one of reasons for inducing apoptosis in VCP2-treated HepG2 cells, but these effects may be not obviously related to Bad. Using iTRAQ and 2D-LC-MSMS, 113 differentially expressed proteins identified in normal and VCP2-treated HepG2 cells. Among them, the expressions of 59 proteins were upregulation, and the expressions of 54 proteins were downregulation.

Therefore it is of utmost importance to spatially characterize this tissue heterogeneity and to identify appropriate biomarkers. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can analyze spatially resolved tissue biopsies on a molecular level.   Experimental design MALDI MSI of snap frozen tissues as well as of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) were used to analyze m/z values localized in tumor and non-tumor regions. Peptide identification was performed by using liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS and immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results In both FFPE and frozen tissue specimen seven characteristic masses of the tumor epithelial region were found identified. Using LC-MS/MS, the peaks were identified as Vimentin, Keratin type II, Nucleolin, Heat shock protein 90, Prelamin-A/C, Junction plakoglobin and PGAM1. Finally, Vimentin, Nucleolin and PGAM1 were verified with IHC.  Conclusions and Clinical Relevance The combination of MALDI MSI, LC-MS/MS and subsequent IHC is an appropriate tool to characterize the molecular heterogeneity of tissue as well as to identify new representative biomarkers for a more individualized therapy.

PXD009440	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009440	Human Salivary Prolactine Inducible Protein (PIP)	In the HPLC high-resolution ESI-MS profiles of both multiple sclerosis subjects and healthy controls saliva samples three proteins, with exp. monoisotopic ion [M+H]+ at 13493.9 � 0.2 m/z, 13696.9 � 0.2 m/z (+203 Da, with respect to 13493.9), and 13843.1 � 0.2 m/z (+147 Da, with respect to 13696.9) eluting between 37.8-38.2 minutes, were detected. The mass difference of 203 Da suggested that the protein with exp. monoisotopic [M+H]+ at 13696.9 � 0.2 m/z could correspond to the N-acetylhexosamine (theor. monoisotopic ion at 203.1 m/z) derivative of the 13493.9 � 0.2 m/z protein. On the other hand, the mass difference of 146 Da between the proteins with exp. monoisotopic [M+H]+ at 13843.1 � 0.2 m/z and 13696.9 � 0.2 m/z was in agreement with an additional deoxyhesose moiety (theor. monoisotopic ion at 146.1 m/z). Manual inspection of the high-resolution MS/MS spectra of the [M+10H]+10 ions at 1351.00, 1371.32 and 1386.11 m/z allowed to establish that the three proteins were different proteoforms of PIP with the N-terminal glutamine residue converted to pyro-glutamic acid and with two disulfide bonds, but not to assign the glycosylation site. The presence in the MS/MS spectra of low-molecular weight saccharide oxoniun ions at 204.087 and 138.106 m/z confirmed the presence of an N-acetylhexosamine moiety in the protein with [M+H]+ at 13696.9 � 0.2 m/z.

In top-down experiments protein sequences and sites of covalent modifications were validated by manual inspection of the experimental fragmentation spectra against the theoretical ones generated by MS-Product software available at the ProteinProspector website (http://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/mshome.htm).  The relative abundance of the salivary proteins was determined by measuring the area of RP-HPLC low-resolution ESI-MS eXtracted Ion Current (XIC) peaks, considered when the S/N ratio was at least 5. This value is linearly proportional to the peptide concentration and it can be used to monitor relative abundances, under constant analytical conditions [36]. To determine reliable XIC peak area, the choice of m/z values of the protein of interest is relevant, in particular in crowded chromatographic where ESI spectra belonging to other proteins might share ions with the same m/z value. The window for all these values was in a range of �0.5 m/z. In order to minimize errors associated with sample dilution, the XIC peak value of each protein/peptide analyzed was correct with respect to the XIC peak value of the leucine encephalin internal standard. Statistical analyses were performed with the software GraphPad Prism 6.0. Data distributions were tested for normality by D'Agostino-Pearson test. A comparison between multiple sclerosis subjects and healthy controls  was performed by using the following statistical tests depending on data distribution (normal or skewed), and variance (homogeneous or unequal): parametric t-test (variance homogeneous); t-test with Welch correction (normal distribution, variance unequal), and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test (skewed distribution, variance unequal).	9/04/2018	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.jprot.2018.07.019"",""PMID:30086402""]]"
PXD006911	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006911	myocardial tissue from atrial fibrillation patients	Electrical and structural remodeling processes are contributors to the self-perpetuating nature of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, their correlation has not been clarified. In this study, human atrial tissues from the patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease in either sinus rhythm or persistent AF were analyzed using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach. An up-regulation in chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) 1, 4, 5 and a rise in type IV collagen were revealed. Combined with the results from immunohistochemistry and electron microscope analysis, the distribution of type IV collagen and effects of fibrosis on myocyte membrane indicated the possible interaction between CLIC and type IV collagen, confirmed by protein structure prediction and co-immunoprecipitation. These results indicate that CLICs play an important role in the development of atrial fibrillation and that CLICs and structural type IV collagen may interact on each other to promote the development of AF in rheumatic mitral valve disease.

PXD009056	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009056	Gut microbial functional maturation and succession during early life	The evolutional trajectory of gut microbial colonization from birth has been shown to prime for health later in life. Here, we combined cultivation-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics to investigate the functional maturation of gut microbiota in faecal samples from full-term healthy infants collected at 6 and 18 months of age. Phylogenetic analysis of the metaproteomes showed that Bifidobacterium provided the highest number of distinct protein groups. Considerable divergences between taxa abundance and protein phylogeny were observed at all taxonomic ranks. Age had a profound effect on early microbiota where compositional and functional complexity of less dissimilar communities increased with time. Comparisons of the relative abundances of proteins revealed the transition of taxon-associated saccharolytic and carbon metabolism strategies from catabolic pathways of milk and mucin-derived monosaccharides feeding acetate/propanoate synthesis to complex food sugars fuelling butyrate production. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis uncovered two anti-correlated modules of functional taxa. A low-connected Bifidobacteriaceae-centred guild of facultative anaerobes was succeeded by a rich club of obligate anaerobes densely interconnected around Lachnospiraceae, underpinning their pivotal roles in microbial ecosystem assemblies. Our findings establish a framework to visualize whole microbial community metabolism and ecosystem succession dynamics, proposing opportunities for microbiota-targeted health-promoting strategies early in life.

To quantify the amount of variability explained by each variable and subject in our different data sets, we calculated the coefficient of determination (R2). For the response of composition and function of the microbiota, multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices was performed, based on Bray-Curtis distance metrics. The matrices were partitioned in sources of variation with subject and characteristics of the study population as explanatory variables.

PXD007894	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007894	Absolute quantitation of proteins by two-point quantitation using dimethylated proteotypic peptides	Absolute targeted proteomics typically employs known amounts of synthetic stable isotopically labeled peptides which are mixed with the analyte and analysed by LC-MS. In order to obtain accurate data, we evaluated the use of two different stable isotopes of the same peptide as spike-in for absolute quantification. For this purpose, peptide labeling by reductive amination was applied, which is a mild reaction for dimethylation of amine groups with very high yield and very little side reactions. Furthermore, three different forms can be generated with e.g., light and heavy labels for spike-in peptides, and medium label for endogenous peptides. The addition of the dimethylated proteotypic peptide in two different versions allows to determine the accuracy of the quantification of endogenous peptides using the relative ratio of the intensities of the two internal standards. The method was studied with peptides of apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B-100, and leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein without and with serum. In serum, the endogenous protein concentrations were accurately measured across four orders of magnitude by the two-point quantitation method. Less than 20% of coefficient of variation (CV) values and strong correlation with R2 of 0.99 across three analytical replicates was observed. The results showed that the accuracy to determine the amount of endogenous peptides can be validated using two references against each other, which cannot be obtained by one-point quantitation. Because of the significant lower costs than synthetic stable isotopically labeled peptides, this approach might be particularly interesting for the absolute quantitation of multiple proteins.

Their lifespan in the blood stream is around 120 days. The turnover implies the production of 2 million new reticulocytes each second. Circulating reticulocytes achieve their maturation in 2 to 3 days. During this short time, important modifications occur such as membrane remodeling, removing of remaining organelles and specific elimination of useless proteins such as the transferrin receptor. This remodeling will ensure the optimization of the erythrocyte ability to fulfil its transport functions. We performed a deep label-free quantitative proteome analysis of purified erythrocytes and reticulocytes to better understand the physiology of the erythrocytes and the last steps of their maturation.

The search criteria were: full tryptic specificity was required; two missed cleavage sites were allowed; oxidation of methionine, 13C(6)15N(2) at lysine, 13C(6) at arginine, and acetylation of protein N-terminus were set as variable modifications; carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as the fixed modification; and precursor ion mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm for all MS and 20 mmu for all MS2 spectra. Peptide false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated using the percolator function provided by Proteome Discoverer, with a cutoff score of 1% based on decoy database searching. Proteome Discoverer Searching Algorithm was used for protein quantification. Briefly, relative protein expression ratios were calculated using the peak area of Lys0Arg0 divided by the peak area of Lys8Arg6. Only peptides assigned to a given protein group were considered unique. Proteins with two or more unique peptide matches were regarded as confident identifications and further quantified. Differences in protein abundance between sample and control groups were calculated by averaging unique peptide ratios for that protein.

We have generated transcriptome profiles from RP11 (PRPF31-mutated) patient-derived retinal organoids and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), as well as Prpf31+/- mouse tissues, which revealed that disrupted alternative splicing occurred for specific splicing programmes. Mis-splicing of genes encoding pre-mRNA splicing proteins was limited to patient-specific retinal cells and Prpf31+/- mouse retinae and RPE. Mis-splicing of genes implicated in ciliogenesis and cellular adhesion was associated with severe RPE defects that include disrupted apical-basal polarity, reduced trans-epithelial resistance and phagocytic capacity, and decreased cilia length and incidence. Disrupted cilia morphology also occurred in patient-derived photoreceptors, associated with progressive degeneration and cellular stress. In situ gene-editing of a pathogenic mutation rescued protein expression and key cellular phenotypes in RPE and photoreceptors, providing proof-of-concept for future therapeutic strategies.

PXD005436	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD005436	Proteomic analysis of human follicular fluid in poor ovarian responders during in vitro fertilization	Poor ovarian response (POR) observed in controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) is often observed during in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) cycles and is a major problem. A POR has been found to be related to several factors, including advanced age, high body mass index, and history of ovarian or pelvic surgery. However, it is difficult to predict POR, as there are no specific biomarkers known. In this study, we used quantitative proteomic analyses to investigate potential biomarkers that can predict poor response during IVF based on follicular fluid samples. A total of 1,079 proteins were identified using a high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled online to a nano flow liquid chromatography system. It is notable that 65 up-regulated and 66 down-regulated proteins were found to be functionally enriched in poor responders. We also validated these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) using a triple-quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometer for quantification of targeted proteins. Of the DEPs, three proteins (pregnancy zone protein, renin, and sushi repeat-containing protein SRPX) were regarded as statistically significant (p < 0.05). These proteins (one known as an inhibitor of cell growth and another as a regulator of angiogenesis) are potential biomarkers candidates of POR in IVF.

Materials and Methods: We employed liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cSCC material to study the tumor and normal skin tissue proteomes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to interpret the role of altered proteins in cSCC pathophysiology. Results were validated using the Human Protein Atlas and Oncomine database in silico. Results: Of 1,310 unique proteins identified, expression of an average of 144 and 88 proteins were significantly (p<0.05) increased and decreased, respectively, in the tumor samples compared to their normal counterparts. IPA analysis revealed disruptions in proteins associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. In silico analysis confirmed that proteins corresponding to 12 antibodies, and genes corresponding to 18 proteins were differentially expressed between the two categories, validating our proteomic measurements. Conclusion: Label-free MS-based proteomics is useful for analyzing FFPE cSCC tissues.

Peptide mixtures (10 ?g) were prepared in 20 ?l of 1% formic acid (FA) and 0.05% heptafluorobutyric acid for RP-LC-MS/MS analysis. Samples were separated by a nanoflow Ultimate 3000 HPLC and autosampler system (Dionex Corp, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) coupled online to a Q-Exactive� Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a nanospray ionization ion source. Peptides (2 ?g) were loaded in triplicate at a flow rate of 200 nl/min onto a C18-reversed phase column with mobile phase buffers A (2% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% FA) and B (80% ACN/0.1% FA), over a 2- h linear gradient (2-45% B for 118 min; 45-80% B for 1 min, 80% B for 1 min). Duplicate blank runs (30 min, 2-80% buffer B) were performed between each sample type, with 10 min washes with 2% buffer B prior to each sample. Data acquisition was achieved in a positive polarity mode using a data-dependent top-10 method where the most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (350-1,750 m/z) were dynamically chosen for higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 while for HCD spectra this was set to 17,500. In order to increase the likely coverage of lower abundant precursor ions, a 30 s dynamic exclusion list was employed. Automatic gain control was used to ensure that the Orbitrap mass analyzer always filled with the optimum number of ions, i.e. 1�106, for generation of MS/MS spectra. Normalized collision energy was set to 30 eV to achieve optimum fragmentation efficiency, and the intensity threshold, which defines the minimum precursor intensity to trigger an MS2 scan, was set to 5�104. A list of around 500 ion masses corresponding to the most common and prominent peptide contaminants were added as an exclusion list.

Here, we performed a label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of ?-catenin immunoprecipitates from human platelets identifying 9 co-immunoprecipitating proteins. GO biological pathway analysis revealed a significant enrichment of specific functional terms including 'cell adhesion', 'cell junction organization' and �adherens junction organization'. Our bioinformatics data suggests that human platelet ?-catenin may be involved in facilitating cell adhesion and cell junctions.

An FDR of 0.01 (1%) was used at the peptide and protein level and was estimated by searching a reversed and forward database. To generate the LFQ intensity protein profiles, signals of corresponding peptides in different HP LC MS/MS runs were matched by MaxQuant applying a mass accuracy of at least 20 ppm and a maximum retention time window of 2 min (Luber, Cox et al. 2010). Protein profiles were based on the ion intensities of all peptides assigned to a given protein in each of the fractions analysed.

PXD006607	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006607	Proteomic analysis of human Medulloblastoma reveals distinct activated pathways between subgroups	Deregulations in fundamental signaling pathways are key events in pathogenesis of cancer. One intriguing illustration that still holds blind spots is the pediatric brain tumor arising from the developing cerebellum: medulloblastoma (MB). Extensive high-throughput sequencing led to the characterization of four MB subgroups (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4) delineated with distinct molecular signatures and clinical outcomes. However, up-to-date these analyses have not attained the global comprehension of their dynamic network complexity. Wishing to uncover a comprehensive view of all MB subgroups we employed a proteomic analysis to integrate accurate protein expression and activity that should ultimately give rise to a realistic picture of how MB cancer cells are regulated. In this study we present the first analysis regrouping methylation status, whole-transcriptome sequencing and quantitative proteomics (proteome and phosphoproteome) using a super SILAC / spiked in strategy across 38 flash frozen primary human MBs (5 WNT, 10 SHH, 10 Group 3 and 13 Group 4). First, our data pinpointed that proteomic analysis could reveal MB subgroup identity. Second, analysis of proteome and phosphoproteome highlighted disregulated signaling pathways that have not been predicted by transcriptomic analysis. Altogether, combined multi-scale analyses of MB have allowed us to identify unrevealed pathways involved in human MB genesis and progression.

PXD010705	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010705	Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid via data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the brain and serves as a valuable specimen to examine diseases of the central nervous system through analyzing its components. These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.

Four different spectral libraries were generated (with mass spectrometry proteomics data from the DDA analysis  deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE39 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD010698  for native CSF, PXD009624 for fractionated CSF and PXD010690 for substantia nigra) by using Spectronaut 9.0 (Biognosys). Therefore, different .MSF files from PD were uploaded to the �Prepare� perspective of Spectronaut and treated with the following settings: for identification only peptides with high confidence level (equals a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%) were considered and protein inference was performed by Spectronaut. Spectral Library Filters were set to no missed cleavage filters, no peptide charge filters, number of best fragment ions between 3 and 6 in a mass range of 300 � 1800 m/z. The first library (library A) consisted of five .MSF files of native CSF samples (5069 precursors).

PXD009603	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009603	Proteomic Evidence of Dietary Sources in Ancient Dental Calculus	Archaeological dental calculus has emerged as a rich source of ancient biomolecules, including proteins. Previous analyses of proteins extracted from ancient dental calculus revealed the presence of the dietary milk protein ?-lactoglobulin, providing direct evidence of dairy consumption in the archaeological record. However, the potential for calculus to preserve other food-related proteins has not yet been systematically explored. Here we analyse shotgun metaproteomic data from 100 archaeological dental calculus samples ranging from the Iron Age to the post-medieval period (8thC BC - 19thC AD) in Britain, as well as dental calculus from contemporary dental patients and recently deceased individuals, to characterise the range and extent of dietary proteins preserved in dental calculus. In addition to milk proteins, we detected proteomic evidence of foodstuffs such as cereals and plant products, as well as the digestive enzyme salivary amylase. We discuss the importance of optimized protein extraction methods, data analysis approaches, and authentication strategies in the identification of dietary proteins from archaeological dental calculus. Our ability to detect dietary proteins, although limited, demonstrates the potential of these methods to robustly identify foodstuffs in the archaeological record that are under-represented due to their poor preservation.

PXD011175	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD011175	AUTOMATED PHOSPHOPEPTIDE ENRICHMENT FROM MINUTE QUANTITIES OF FROZEN MALIGNANT MELANOMA TISSUE	To acquire a deeper understanding of malignant melanoma (MM), it is essential to study the proteome of patient tissues. In particular, phosphoproteomics of MM has become of significant importance because of the central role that phosphorylation plays in the development of MM. Investigating clinical samples, however, is an extremely challenging task as there is usually only very limited quantities of material available to perform targeted enrichment approaches. Here, an automated phosphopeptide enrichment protocol using the AssayMap Bravo platform was applied to MM tissues and assessed for performance. The strategy proved to be highly-sensitive, less prone to variability, less laborious than existing techniques and adequate for starting quantities at the microgram level. An Fe(III)-NTA-IMAC-based enrichment workflow was applied to a dilution series of MM tissue lysates. The workflow was efficient in terms of sensitivity, reproducibility and phosphosite localization; and from only 12.5 �g of sample, more than 1,000 phosphopeptides were identified. In addition, from 60 �g of protein material the number of identified phosphoproteins from individual MM samples was comparable to previous reports that used extensive fractionation methods. Our data set included key pathways that are involved in MM progression; such as MAPK, melanocyte development and integrin signaling. Moreover, tissue-specific immunological proteins were identified, that have not been previously observed in the proteome of MM-derived cell lines. In conclusion, this workflow is suitable to study large cohorts of clinical samples that demand automatic and careful handling.

PXD007740	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007740	A system-wide approach to monitor responses to synergistic BRAF and EGFR inhibition in colorectal cancer cells	Molecular heterogeneity of tumors, epigenetic changes and a diverse range of molecular mechanisms are main contributors to drug resistance, which represents one of the great challenges in cancer treatment. A deeper understanding of the molecular biology of cancer has resulted in better targeted therapies, where one or multiple drugs are adopted in novel therapies to tackle resistance. This beneficial effect of using combination treatments has to some extent also been observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation, whereby dual inhibition of BRAF(V600E) and EGFR increases antitumor activity. Notwithstanding this success, it is not clear whether this combination treatment is the only or most effective treatment to block resistance. Here, we investigate molecular responses upon single and multi-target treatments, over time, using BRAF(V600E) mutant CRC cells as a well-define model system. Through integration of transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomics data we obtain a comprehensive overview, revealing both well-known and novel responses. We primarily observe widespread upregulation of tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and and metabolic pathways. This points to by which the treated cells switch energy sources as a defensive response entering a quiescent like state, while activating signalling to re-activate the MAPK pathway.

OMICs technologies cannot be applied on clinically precious human material as this is required in its integrity for routine pathology investigation. Hence all OMICs discovery today is done on residual and not clinically relevant material. In the study, we present a novel, non-destructive, procedure named EXPEL, which uses rapid, pressure-assisted, interstitial fluid extrusion, allowing for full clinical pathology and OMICs analysis (proteins, metabolites, miRNA and DNA) on the same specimen. To demonstrate this we engage in a simultaneous biomarker discovery and routine diagnostic analysis of human colorectal cancer and liver metastases. Biomarkers discovered with EXPEL methodology can be readily detected in human sera, allowing for unprecedented translation to the clinic.

Although epidemiological studies showing adverse effects such as oxidative stress-induced aging exists, studies showing the cellular and molecular response to such stress are rare. Using a primary skin keratinocyte model and TMT-based quantitative proteomics strategy, we studied the effects of chronic exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPE) and DPE vapor on the cellular proteome and the ability of a known anti-oxidant Vitamin E in ameliorating such changes. LC-MS3 analysis of DPE and/or its vapor exposed skin keratinocytes resulted in quantification of 4,490 proteins of which 201 and 374 proteins were significantly dysregulated (?1.5 fold, p-value ?0.05) in each condition, respectively. We observed distinct molecular alterations in chronic DPE and DPE vapor exposure models.

Large-scale proteomic profiling studies of these lesions are also non-existent.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate proteomic changes between normal epidermis, AK, BD and cSCC that could support a molecular classification and improve our understanding of disease progression.  METHODS: Microdissected formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples of normal epidermis (n?=?4, pooled), AK (n?=?10), BD (n?=?10) and cSCC (n?=?10) were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Following normalization and multiple testing adjustments, differential abundance analysis was performed using Linear Models for Microarray data. Proteins were filtered for significance (adjusted p-value???0.05) and fold change of at least �1.5. Comparative bioinformatics analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Proteomic findings were subsequently substantiated using immunohistochemistry.  RESULTS: 2073 unique proteins were identified. cSCC had the highest number of differentially abundant proteins (63 proteins) followed by BD (58 proteins) and AK (46 proteins). Six proteins (APOA1, ALB, SERPINA1, HLA-B, HP and TXNDC5) were differentially abundant in cSCC compared to AK. Immunohistochemical analysis corroborated changes in MIF, RPL37A and TXNDC5. IPA analysis predicted that cell proliferation, angiogenesis and inflammatory reactions were significantly activated in cSCC compared to BD and AK. Cell death and DNA damage were predicted to be inhibited in BD.  CONCLUSION: Our study supports the concept that AK and BD are precursors of cSCC. The identification of proteome changes indicates disruption of repair, pro-apoptotic, and tumor promoting pathways. Our findings will help select targets for classification and treatment.

The identification of specific biomarkers is required to facilitate diagnosis and therapy of dry AMD. We thus measured the proteome of 34 vitreous humor samples (dry AMD: n = 6, nAMD: n = 10, PDR: n = 9, ERM: n = 9). Samples were immunodepleted for high abundant blood proteins and analyzed by LC-MS/MS with a shotgun approach. Data from dry AMD, nAMD and PDR were compared to the ERM patient group, which was used as reference group. A bioinformatic pipeline was used for label-free relative quantification of proteins and to perform cluster analysis, gene ontology classification and gene set enrichment analysis. A selection of differentially regulated proteins was validated by ELISA.  A total of 677 proteins were identified and relatively quantified in the four patient groups. Different clusters of regulated proteins for each patient group were identified and showed characteristic enrichment of specific pathways, like �oxidative stress� for dry AMD, �focal adhesion� for nAMD and �complement and coagulation cascade� for PDR patients. We�ve identified CHLE to be specifically upregulated in dry AMD and RNAS1 together with CPVL to be upregulated in both forms of AMD. The description of pathways specific for the different patient groups and the identification of differentially regulated proteins provide a first step towards the definition of biomarkers for dry AMD. To validate these data and to unravel the mechanistic connection of identified proteins to dry AMD, larger patient cohorts need to be investigated.

The feature maps of all samples were aligned to the measurement of a representative pool of 4 samples per patient group. Peptides with a charge state of 2+ to 5+ were used for quantification. From each Progenesis peptide ion the top five tandem mass spectra were exported using charge deconvolution and deisotoping option at a maximum number of 200 peaks per MS2. The Mascot generic file (.mgf) was searched with Mascot Server v. 2.5.1 (www.matrixscience.com; Matrix Science; London; U.K) using the following search parameters:maximum missed cleavages: 2; peptide mass tolerance: 10 ppm (# 13C = 1); and fragment ion tolerance: 0.5 Da. Carbamidomethyl on Cystein was specified as fixed, whereas oxidation on Methionine and acetylation at protein N-terminus were specified as variable modifications. Searches were performed against the human protein database (Taxonomy ID: 9606) from UniProt (59�783 entries; downloaded at: 02.09.2016) concatenated to a decoy (reversed) database and 260 known mass spectrometry contaminants. A target-decoy approach was used to estimated the false-discovery levels.4 Peptide and protein assignments were filtered for peptide identification with maximally 5 % FDR and protein identification with less than 10 % protein FDR by Scaffold (Vers. 4.8.3; Proteome Software; Portland, Oregon, USA). The Scaffold spectrum report was exported and loaded into ProgenesisQI. Decoy hits and proteins with single peptide assignment were excluded from further analysis. For protein quantification the normalized abundance of all non-conflicting peptide ions of the same protein group were summed together individually for each sample to generate the normalized quantitative protein abundance. Dry AND, nAMD and PDR patient groups were relatively quantified to the ERM patient group. Fold changes (FC) were calculated and statistical significance was determined by parametric t-test (ANOVA) on the hyperbolic arcsine transformed normalized protein abundance. A protein was defined to be significantly differentially regulated if it reached a |log2(FC)| > 0.58 with a p-value < 0.05.	4/12/2017	"[[""DOI:10.1167/iovs.18-24122"",""PMID:30025106""],[""DOI:10.1167/IOVS.18-24122"",""PMID:0""]]"

ROs and chRCCs show pronounced molecular and histological similarities, which renders their differentiation demanding. We aimed for the differential proteome profiling of ROs and chRCCs in order to better understand distinguishing protein patterns.   Methods We employed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples (six RO cases, six chRCC cases) together with isotopic triplex dimethylation and a pooled reference standard to enable cohort-wide quantitative comparison. For lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and integrin alpha-V (ITGAV) we performed corroborative immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an extended cohort of 42 RO cases and 31 chRCC cases lacking any overlap with the smaller proteomic cohort.  Results: At 1 % false discovery rate, we identified > 3900 proteins, of which >2400 proteins were consistently quantified in at least four RO and four chRCC cases. The proteomic expression profiling discriminated ROs and chRCCs and highlighted established features such as accumulation of mitochondrial proteins in ROs together with emphasizing the accumulation of endo-lysosomal proteins in chRCCs. In line with the proteomic data, IHC showed enrichment of LAMP1 in chRCC and of ITGAV in RO.   Conclusion We present one of the first differential proteome profiling studies on ROs and chRCCs and highlight differential abundance of LAMP1 and ITGAV in these renal tumors.

PXD007873	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007873	TDP-43 in ALS/FTLD studied by a novel aggregate extraction method	Accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) is the main pathological finding characterizing affected neurons in most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). At least four different subtypes of FTLD-TDP have been described, based on the morphology and neuroanatomical distribution of pathological TDP-43 accumulations. To understand the molecular basis of this heterogeneity that correlates with clinical presentations, we developed SarkoSpin, a new method for the biochemical isolation of pathological TDP-43 from complex tissues. Using postmortem samples of 79 patients and controls, we show that SarkoSpin allows the physical separation of pTDP-43 from ~99.8% of total proteins, including the extreme bulk of physiological TDP-43. Pathological TDP-43 extracted from different disease subtypes forms large and buoyant assemblies of distinct densities and 3-dimentional shapes that correlate with specific neuropathological classifications.

PXD005693	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD005693	Biomarkers discovery for Colorectal cancer	Identification of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers measurable in liquid biopsies remains a major challenge in oncology today.  OMICs technologies cannot be applied on clinically precious human material as this is required in its integrity for routine pathology investigation. Hence all OMICs discovery today is done on residual and not clinically relevant material. In the study, we present a novel, non-destructive, procedure named EXPEL, which uses rapid, pressure-assisted, interstitial fluid extrusion, allowing for full clinical pathology and OMICs analysis (proteins, metabolites, miRNA and DNA) on the same specimen. To demonstrate this we engage in a simultaneous biomarker discovery and routine diagnostic analysis of human colorectal cancer and liver metastases. Biomarkers discovered with EXPEL methodology can be readily detected in human sera, allowing for unprecedented translation to the clinic. EXPEL method enables for the first time both clinicians and scientist to explore identical, fresh, clinical material regardless of origin and size.

By monitoring the rate of incorporation of labelled amino acids into newly synthesised proteins as they appear in the media, we can differentiate those proteins that have been destined for secretion, and exhibit rapid labelling, from those with low rates of labelling or low turnover relative to the growth rate of the cells which is a feature of intracellular proteins.

Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation was allowed as a variable modification. The initial precursor and fragment ion maximum mass deviations were set to 20 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. Peptide and protein false discovery rates (FDRs) were set to 1%, the �requant� function activated and �match between runs� enabled with the default parameters. For each peptide which passed a 1% FDR threshold in the Andromeda search, the relative isotope abundance (RIA) was calculated at each time-point if available in the MS data. We applied a set of stringent criteria in order to produce high quality data-sets for each cell-line analysed. First, the RIA data for at least 3 time-points were considered necessary for determination of the labelling trajectory. As the protein content of the secretome increases with time, we only analysed peptides where we had RIA data at both 6 h and 24 h post exchange of DMEM. We only focussed on peptides that had been identified and quantified, allowing RIA calculation, at > 1 time-point in the labelling trajectory, too, so that we were effectively tracking their RIA behaviour over time. Peptides for which we obtained evidence at a single time-point, were rejected, even if they yielded informative RIA data for the kinetic behaviour of the parent protein in the system). Peptides were also rejected from further analysis if they showed impossible behaviour in this experimental system, for example, their calculated RIA 30 min after media exchange was > that after 24 h. To assess changes in the abundance of proteins identified from the 1% FDR Andromeda searches, we summed the peptide intensity reported by MaxQuant of labelled (heavy) and unlabelled (light) features to obtain a surrogate label-free quantification value. All mathematical modelling and data visualisations were carried out using R (v3.5.0) and ggplot2 (v2.0.0).	8/10/2019	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.TIR117.000516"",""PMID:29915148""]]"

We have analyzed sections from FFPE biopsy blocks and identified more than 4500 protein without sample pre-fractionation. We have compared protein expression in two sample cohorts that were chosen retrospectively from patients participating in research protocols at our facility. First we compared biopsies from 10 patients collected at the time of diagnoses (untreated CD) with biopsies collected 1 year later following gluten free diet (treated CD). We observed overall good agreement between differential expression of proteins and histological changes that occur in the intestine. We identified biological pathways that are known to operate in the disease lesion. We also observed a strong signal for neutrophil infiltration. By use of a dedicated immunoglobulin variable gene family database we found that differential expression of IGHV5-51 distinguished our untreated from treated CD patients. We also compared protein expression in 4 treated CD patients that developed histological changes in the small intestine in response to a 3 day gluten challenge. Although these patients develop an intestinal lesion resembling the lesion observed in untreated patients, we observed differential expression of proteins involved in acute tissue remodeling that were not seen when we compared UCD to TCD samples. Our study presents a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that analysis of material from FFPE tissue block material can provide a comprehensive overview of many disease processes that occur in the celiac small intestine.

Ductus arteriosus closure involves functional and structural remodeling, controlled by many factors. The closure-related human plasma proteins are unknown. Here we for the first time demonstrate six key differential plasma proteins in the human PDA patients using proteomic technology and present a model to illustrate the constriction and closure of ductus arteriosus. We found that permanent closure might be regulated by the proteins related to platelet activation and coagulation cascades, complement mannan-binding-lectin, and other systemic signaling pathways. Our findings indicate that the differential proteins involved in these pathways may play key roles in the non-closure of the ductus arteriosus and may be developed as biomarkers for diagnosis.

Here, we investigated the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery on the plasma proteome, hypothesizing that specific proteins or protein patterns may serve as key mediators and markers of the metabolic response. We performed MS-based proteomics on two longitudinal studies encompassing 47 morbidly obese patients, generating quantitative information on more than 1700 proteins. A global correlation matrix incorporating about 200,000 relationships revealed functional connections between proteins and assigned them to physiological processes. The main classes of significantly altered proteins were markers of systemic inflammation and those involved in lipid metabolism, and our data highlight robust correlative and anti-correlative behavior to each other and to clinical parameters.

To explore potential biomarkers of HBV-ACLF for clinical applications, immuno-depletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach was employed to analyze plasma samples from 20 healthy control people, 20 CHB patients and 20 HBV-ACLF patients, respectively. As a result, a total of 427 proteins were identified and quantified from these samples, and 42 proteins were differentially expressed in HBV-ACLF patients as compared to both CHB patients and healthy controls. According to bioinformatics analysis results, 6 proteins related to immune response (MMR), inflammatory response (OPN, HPX), blood coagulation (ATIII) and lipid metabolism (APO-CII, GP73) were selected as biomarker candidates. Further ELISA analysis confirmed the significant up-regulation of GP73, MMR, OPN and down-regulation of ATIII, HPX, APO-CII in HBV-ACLF plasma samples (p<0.01). Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed high diagnostic value of these candidates in assessing HBV-ACLF. In conclusion, present quantitative proteomic study identified 6 novel HBV-ACLF biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for development of HBV-ACLF biomarker.

PXD009813	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009813	Human salivary basic proline-rich proteins	Human basic proline-rich proteins and basic glycosylated proline-rich proteins are the most complex family of human adult salivary proteins, secreted only by the parotid gland, expressed by the polymorphic PRB1-4 genes. This study reports the results obtained for their characterization in our laboratory utilizing integrated top-down and bottom-up HPLC-ESI-MS and MS/MS platform. The family include 11 parent peptides/proteins and more than 6 parent glycosylated proteins. Despite the complexity, on the basis of their primary structure they result the product of the duplication of three repeats and we propose that they can be classified in two main groups, the first including the peptides called P-E, P-Ko, IB-6, Ps-1, Ps-2, P-H, P-F, P-J, and P-D, the second including the peptides called IB-1, II-2 and the glycosylated basic proline-rich proteins codified by PRB3 and PRB4 genes. A third minor hybrid group includes the proteins called IB-8a Con1- and Con1+.  Some of the proteins of the family (IB-1, II-2 and P-J) are almost always detectable in adult human saliva, while the others are expressed with different frequencies according to the phenotype. Various isoforms are detectable in the adult saliva and three of them, until now not reported (P-H S1?A, P-Ko P36?S, P-Ko A41?S), were characterized by MS/MS fragmentation.

Analysis of follicular fluids is similarly difficult as that of blood serum due to the ubiquitous presence of several highly abundant proteins and a wide range of protein concentrations. Therefore, the accessibility of this complex body fluid for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis is a challenging opportunity to gain insights into the physiological status or to identify new diagnostic and prognostic markers for e.g. the treatment of infertility.

Endosomes undergo a process of maturation which specifies whether material will be shuttled back to the cell surface or degraded by the lysosome. Nevertheless, a complete inventory of factors regulating endosomal maturation is still lacking. Recently, membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endosomes have emerged as important players in endosomal sorting, dynamics and motility. Here, we identify the ER transmembrane protein PDZD8 as a new Rab7 effector that, together with the MCS component Protrudin, forms an ER-late endosome MCS. At these ER-late endosome MCSs, PDZD8 also recruits mitochondria to form a three-way contact. Our data suggest that the PDZD8/Protrudin-Rab7 MCS functions to facilitate an early stage of late endosome maturation.

Our understanding of the early kidney response to chronic hyperglycemia remains incomplete. In this study, we aimed to uncover the early, dysregulated pathways in the diabetic kidney before the onset of microalbuminuria by analysing the urinary proteomes of otherwise healthy youths with and without type 1 diabetes. Our study population included two cohorts for the discovery (N = 30) and validation (N = 30) of differentially excreted proteins. Of the 2451 proteins identified, 576 were quantified in all samples from the discovery cohort, and 34 comprised the urinary signature for early type 1 diabetes after Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment (Q < 0.05). The top pathways associated with this signature included lysosome, glycosaminoglycan degradation, and innate immune system (Q < 0.01). Notably, all enzymes involved in keratan sulfate degradation were significantly elevated in urines from youths with type 1 diabetes (fold change > 1.6). Increased urinary excretion of monocyte differentiation antigen CD14, hexosaminidase A, and lumican was also observed in the validation cohort (P < 0.05).

However, limited data is available regarding the MB tumor microenvironment. Here we present a mass spectrometry-based multi-omics study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from recurrent MB patients. A group of age-matched patients without a neoplastic disease was used as control cohort. Proteome profiling identified several characteristic tumor markers and revealed a strong prevalence of anti-inflammatory and tumor-promoting proteins characteristic for alternatively polarized myeloid cells in MB samples. The up-regulation of ADAMTS1, GAP43 and GPR37 indicated hypoxia in CSF of MB patients. This notion was independently supported by metabolomics, demonstrating up-regulation of tryptophan, methionine, serine and lysine, all of which have been described to be induced upon hypoxia in CSF. The beta-oxidation promoting lipid hormone 12,13-DiHOME was found strongly upregulated, potentially promoting a metabolic shift supporting drug resistance and stem cell properties of MB cells.

AVPC tumors may also express neuroendocrine markers, termed neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Recent evidence suggests kinase signaling may be an important driver of NEPC.

However, the exact localization of phosphorylation sites which depends on trypsin-centric shotgun phosphoproteomics is often arbitrary and unreliable because of the limited product ion coverage in the MS2 spectra. Therefore, phosphorylation site determination from MS data with a single protease cannot be expected to be comprehensive, regardless of the strategy used for phosphopeptide detection. Here, we have explored the application of LysargiNase which was recently reported to mirror trypsin in specificity to cleave arginine and lysine residues exclusively at the N-terminal side. Our data demonstrates that the combined application of LysargiNase and trypsin results in higher sequence coverage with more complete ladder sequences which is helpful to pinpoint the precise phosphorylation sites. Therefore, the combined use of these two enzymes will partially overcome the limitations of trypsin-centric phosphoproteomics to achieve a more reliable phosphoproteome and to increase the identification of novel phosphorylation sites.

PXD012960	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD012960	� Clinical proteomics profiling for biomarker identification  among patients suffering with Indian Post Kala Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis	Post Kala Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a non-fatal dermal sequel of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), caused by protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. On the global scenario, PKDL in mainly restricted to distinct zones of South Asia (India, Nepal and Bangladesh) and East Africa, mainly Sudan. In India, the most prominent fatal form of leishmaniasis present is VL, affecting entirely the eastern region of the country. The clinical presentation of VL and PKDL differ substantially; where VL patients suffer from sustained fever, hepatospleenomegaly, weight loss and anemia, PKDL patients manifest dermal lesions in the form of macular, nodular and polymorphic.  Although, compared to VL, the mortality rate of PKDL is significantly lower, yet it is observed as a stigmatizing disease that brings a substantial socioeconomic burden, further intensified by a hesitancy of patients, to obtain treatment, or due to noncompliance. Lesions, especially the polymorphic forms, are parasite-rich, concluding that PKDL plays a crucial role in the anthroponotic transmission of VL. PKDL patients with Macular lesions, having comparatively lower parasitic load, and thus lacks detection sensitivity with standard techniques like rK39 (73% sensitivity), Leishmanin skin test (54% sensitivity) and Histopathological studies with patients� skin biopsy sample (7-33% sensitivity) and is often misdiagnosed as Vitiligo cases. In order to completely eliminate Kala-azar in Southeast Asia, proper identification of various routes of the disease is essential, which could efficiently distinguish between cured PKDL and active PKDL as well as active PKDL from other cross disease like Leprosy and Vitiligo. Till now very less work has been done towards biomarker identification for PKDL from patients� plasma. Most of the methods for disease identification are based on highly invasive tissue biopsy followed by PCR/qPCR. Recently investigations from our group have demonstrated the presence of novel glycoproteins in the circulating immune complexes (CICs) from serum, as biomarkers for early identification of PKDL patients. An Immune complex (IC), sometimes called an antigen-antibody complex, is a molecule formed from the integral binding of an antibody to a soluble antigen. After an antigen-antibody reaction, the immune complexes can be subject to any number of responses, including complement deposition, opsonisation, phagocytosis, or processing by proteases. Accumulation of ICs leads to a broad spectrum of pro-inflammatory effects, including activation of the complement cascade and induction of cytokine secretion. These complexes may also be deposited in tissues and vessel walls, leading to inflammation, tissue damage and, ultimately, disease manifestations. Immune complexes also affect disease progression and outcome in various disorders through the induction of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines. In the present study we hypothesize that the CICs� proteome is altered among PKDL patients with different dermal manifestations (Macular and Polymorphic) as compared to Cured individuals (CR) and Healthy controls (HI). The aim of this current study is to identify differentially expressed CIC proteomic profile among different forms PKDL patients as compared to HI. The differential protein expression of specific unique peptide fragments, representing specific proteins, could be used as diagnostic biomarkers in early detection of both Macular and Polymorphic PKDL cases. In this prospective study, we included PKDL patients with Macular and/or Polymorphic lesion, Cured individuals and HI. Among the enrolled patients, blood samples were collected from 20 primarily confirmed PKDL patients with Macular lesions, 20 primarily confirmed PKDL patients with Polymorphic lesions, 12 Cured individuals previously suffering from PKDL and 12 Healthy individuals; collected during the period of 2015-2016, stored at -80�C. Next the CICs were purified from PKDL patients� plasma and LC MS/MS analysis was performed using Q-ExactivePlusOrbitrap mass spectrometer. This work for the first time revealed the differential CICs proteome profile among different forms of PKDL patients as compared to their Cured and Healthy counterparts.

During the recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV), myalgia was one of the most frequently reported symptoms. We investigated the susceptibility of human muscle cells to ZIKV infection. Using an in vitro model of human primary myoblasts that can be differentiated into myotubes, we found that myoblasts can be productively infected by ZIKV. In contrast, myotubes were shown to be resistant to ZIKV infection, suggesting a differentiation-dependent susceptibility. Infection was accompanied by a caspase-independent cytopathic effect, associated with paraptosis-like cytoplasmic vacuolization. Proteomic profiling was performed 24h and 48h post-infection in cells infected with two different isolates. Proteome changes indicate that ZIKV infection induces an upregulation of proteins involved in the activation of the Interferon type I pathway, and a downregulation of protein synthesis. This work constitutes the first observation of primary human muscle cells susceptibility to ZIKV infection, and differentiation-dependent restriction of infection from myoblasts to myotubes. Since myoblasts constitute the reservoir of stem cells involved in reparation/regeneration in muscle tissue, the infection of muscle cells and the viral-induced alterations observed here could have consequences in ZIKV infection pathogenesis.

The following search parameters were applied: carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification, oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. The mass tolerances in MS and MS/MS were set to 5 ppm and 20 ppm respectively. Maximum peptide charge was set to 7 and 7 amino acids were required as minimum peptide length. A false discovery rate of 1% was set up for both protein and peptide levels. A match between run features was selected with a matched time window set at 1 min and alignment time window set at 20 min. Quantification was performed using the XIC-based LFQ algorithm with the Fast LFQ mode as described in a previous publication67. Unique and razor peptides, included modified peptides, with at least 2 ratio count were accepted for quantification. Statistical analysis of proteomics data For the statistical analysis of one condition versus another, proteins identified in the reverse and contaminant databases and proteins only identified by site were first discarded from the list. Then, proteins exhibiting fewer than 2 LFQ values or in at least one condition were discarded from the list to avoid misidentified proteins. After log2 transformation of the leftover proteins, LFQ values were normalized by median centering within conditions (normalizeD function of the R package DAPAR69). Remaining proteins without any LFQ value in one condition only have been considered as proteins quantitatively present in a condition and absent in another. They have therefore been set aside and considered as differentially abundant proteins. Next, missing values were imputed using the imp.norm function of the R package norm. Proteins with a log2 (fold-change) inferior to 1 have been considered as proteins which are not significantly differentially abundant. Statistical testing of the remaining proteins (having a log2 (fold-change) superior to 1) was conducted using a limma t-test70 thanks to the R package limma71. An adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to the resulting p-values thanks to the function adjust.p of R package cp4p72 using a robust method73 to estimate the proportion of true null hypotheses among the set of statistical tests. The proteins associated to an adjusted p-value inferior to an FDR level of 1% have been considered as significantly differentially abundant proteins. Finally, the proteins of interest are therefore those which emerge from this statistical analysis supplemented by those which are considered to be absent from one condition and present in another. Statistical enrichment tests were used to highlight major biological processes that may be affected during the infection, using DAVID software35 by selecting the set of quantified proteins among all replicates as background. Biological processes related to up/down-regulated proteins in each condition have been compared to those of up/down-regulated proteins in non-infected samples. If not specified, statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests were used to test the differences between groups. Pvalues of less than 0.05 were considered significant.	23/01/2020

Initially, a dependent setting of a central value plus minus a variation is available to the users to set up NCEs, and the combination of 30�10% to give the energies 20%/30%/40% has been mostly adopted in the literature. With the recent availability of independent NCE setup, we found that the combination of 20%/30%/30% is better than 20%/30%/40%; in the analysis of complex intact N-glycopeptides enriched from gastric cancer tissues, total IDs with spectrum-level FDR?1%, site-specific IDs with site-determining fragment ions and structure-specific IDs with structure-diagnostic fragment ions were increased by 42% (4,767->6,746), 57% (599->942), and 97% (1771->3495), respectively. This finding will benefit all the coming N-glycoproteomics studies using HCD as the dissociation method.

N-Glycosites are localized with Glyco-brackets (G-brackets) which are defined as the number of core GlcNAc-containing fragment ion pairs each of which can independently confine the N-glycosylation to a unique N-X-S/T/C sequon when multiple sequons exist on the peptide backbones. GF score is defined as number of structure-diagnostic fragment ions.

PXD010508	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010508	Activated neutrophils exert myeloid-derived suppressor cell activity, damaging T cells beyond repair	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have the capacity to suppress T cell-mediated immune responses, and impact clinical outcome of cancer, infections and transplantation settings. Although MDSCs were initially described as bone-marrow-derived immature myeloid cells (either monocytic [m-MDSC] or granulocytic [g-MDSC]), also mature neutrophils have been shown to exert MDSC activity towards T cells, in ways that so far remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that human neutrophils � both from healthy donors and cancer patients � do not exert MDSC activity unless they are activated. Using neutrophils with genetically well-defined defects, we found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and granule-derived constituents are required for MDSC activity after direct CD11b-dependent neutrophil-T cell interactions. Besides these cellular interactions, neutrophils were engaged in the uptake of pieces of T cell membrane, a process called trogocytosis. Together, these interactions led to changes in T cell morphology, mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion, as indicated by electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and metabolic parameters. Our studies characterize the different steps by which activated mature neutrophils induce functional T cell non-responsiveness and irreparable cell damage.

However, those methods had never been compared in samples from the same tumor and patient. In this work, we compared the two most used methods, elution and centrifugation, in pieces of the same biopsy samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). First, we established that high G-force (10000g) was required to obtain TIF from cSCC by centrifugation. Secondly, we compared the centrifugation method with the elution method in pieces of three different cSCC tumors. We found that the mean protein intensities based in the number of peptide spectrum matches was significantly higher in the centrifuged samples than in the eluted samples. Regarding the robustness of the methods, we observed higher overlapping between both methods (77-80%) than among samples (50%). These results suggest that exists an elevated consistence of TIF composition independently of the method used. However, we observed a three-fold increase of extracellular proteins in non-overlapped proteome obtained by centrifugation. We therefore conclude that centrifugation is the method of choice to study the proteome of TIF from cutaneous biopsies.

As MWCNT are produced in large quantities, occupational exposure and human health is of particular concern. However, there is no consensus regarding their potential harmful effects. In particular, chronic exposure to MWCNT and mechanisms of their action at protein and lipid levels are unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate effects of long-term chronic exposure to MWCNT on cellular proteome and lipidome. Since the lung is the major target organ, an in vitro normal bronchial epithelial cell model was used. To better mimic exposure at occupational settings, cells were chronically exposed for 13 weeks to low-doses of MWCNT. MWCNT-treatment increased ROS levels in cells without increasing DNA damage and resulted in differential expression of multiple apoptotic proteins. A shotgun proteomic and lipidomic analysis of the MWCNT-exposed cells showed that of amongst the >5000 identified protein s,groups; more than 200 were altered in treated cells.  Functional analysis revealed association of these differentially regulated proteins in various cellular processes such as cell death and survival, cellular assembly and organization. Similarly, the lipid profile of the MWCNT treated cells showed accumulation of multiple lipid classes. This is first study to present results indicating that long-term MWCNT-exposure of human normal lung cells at occupationally relevant low-dose may alter both the proteome and the lipidome profile of target epithelial cells in the lung.

We and others identified tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the ascites as promoters of metastasis-associated processes like extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, tumor cell migration, adhesion and invasion. The precise mechanisms and mediators involved in these functions of TAM are, however, largely unknown. By comparing monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) differentiated in ascites to TAM-like asc-MDM, by LPS/IFN? to inflammatory m1-MDM and by IL-10 to alternatively activated m2c-MDM, we found that conditioned media from both, asc-MDM and m2c-MDM, stimulated migration of patient-derived tumor cells, while m1-MDM failed to do so. Secretome analysis by mass spectrometry identified an overlapping set of 9 proteins secreted by both asc-MDM and m2c-MDM, but not by m1-MDM, in all tested donors. Of these, three proteins, namely transforming growth factor beta induced protein (TGFBI), tenascin C (TNC) and fibronectin (FN1), have been associated with migration-related functions. Intriguingly, increased ascites concentrations of TGFBI, TNC and fibronectin were associated with short progression-free survival. Furthermore, transcriptome and secretome analyses point to TAM as major producers of these proteins, further supporting an essential role for TAM in promoting HGSC progression. Consistent with this hypothesis, we were able to demonstrate that the migration-inducing potential of asc-MDM and m2c-MDM secretomes may be inhibited, at least partially, by neutralizing antibodies against TGFBI and TNC or siRNA-mediated silencing of TGFBI expression. In conclusion, the present study provides the first experimental evidence that TAM-derived TGFBI and TNC in ascites promote HGSC progression.

This can be achieved by using protocols combining extraction of several lines of evidence, which decreases the material needed for analyses while maximizing the information yield. Archaeological dental calculus is a source of several different types of biomolecules, as well as microfossils, and can tell us about the human host, microbiome, diet, and even occupational activities. Here, we present a unified protocol allowing for simultaneous extraction of DNA and proteins from archaeological dental calculus. We evaluate the protocol on dental calculus from a range of ages and estimated preservation states, and compare it against standard DNA-only and protein-only protocols. We find that most aspects of downstream analyses are unaffected by the unified protocol, although minor shifts in the recovered proteome can be detected. Protein recovery depends on both the amount of starting material and choice of extraction protocol, whereas DNA recovery is significantly lowered through the unified protocol. However, DNA recovery from dental calculus is generally very high, and we found no differences in DNA fragment characteristics or taxonomic profile. In conclusion, the unified protocol allows for simultaneous extraction of two complementary lines of evidence from archaeological dental calculus without compromising downstream analyses, thereby minimizing the need for destructive analysis of this finite resource.

While biallelic mutations of the SLC26A4 gene, encoding pendrin, causes non-syndromic hearing loss with EVA or Pendred syndrome, a considerable number of patients appear to carry mono-allelic mutation. This suggests faulty pendrin regulatory machinery results in hearing loss. Here we identify EPHA2 as another causative gene of Pendred syndrome with SLC26A4. EphA2 forms a protein complex with pendrin controlling pendrin localization, which is disrupted in some pathogenic forms of pendrin. Moreover, point mutations leading to amino acid substitution in the EPHA2 gene are identified from patients bearing mono-allelic mutation of SLC26A4. Ephrin-B2 binds to EphA2 triggering internalization with pendrin inducing EphA2 autophosphorylation weakly. The identified EphA2 mutants attenuate ephrin-B2- but not ephrin-A1-induced EphA2 internalization with pendrin. Our results uncover an unexpected role of the Eph/ephrin system in epithelial function.

Here, we show that human and mouse monocytes release TGF-?1-transporting vesicles in response to the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. Soluble beta-glucan from Candida albicans binds to complement receptor 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18) on monocytes and induces the release of TGF-?1-transporting vesicles. CR3-dependence is demonstrated using CR3-deficient (CD11b knockout) monocytes generated by CRISPR-CAS9 genome editing and isolated from CR3-deficient (CD11b knockout) mice. Isolated vesicles dampen the pro-inflammatory response in human M1-macrophages as well as in whole blood. Binding of the vesicle-transported TGF-?1 to the TGF-? receptor inhibits IL-1? gene transcription via the SMAD7 pathway in whole blood and induces TGF-?1 transcription in endothelial cells. Inhibition of TGF-?1 relieved the suppression of such proinflammatory effect. Notably, human opsonized apoptotic bodies induce similar TGF-?1-transporting vesicles in monocytes, suggesting that the early immune response is suppressed through this newly identified CR3-dependent anti-inflammatory vesicle pathway.

AML is a heterogeneous disease in which molecules associated to kinase signaling are frequently mutated. However, no kinase inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of this malignancy. Thus, patient stratification requires new molecular profiling techniques in addition of to the current sequencing strategies. We have used a multiomics approach that combines proteomics, phosphoproteomics, mass cytometry and DNA sequencing to classify primary AML cells derived from 36 patients. Comprehensive integrative analysis identified molecular signatures based on phosphopeptide abundance or surface marker expression that separate AML cases according to their differentiation status. Differentiated cells presented a particular pattern of protein phosphorylation, an enrichment in the activity of several kinases and a higher sensitivity to PAK, MEK and PKC/FLT3 inhibitors. In addition, mutations in proteins closely linked to kinase signaling were more frequent on differentiated cells. Interestingly the set of patients with differentiated cells as clustered by marker expression signatures showed an increased overall survival in our set of patients and in the TCGA database registered cohort. Thus, molecular differentiation signatures could be used as prognosis and drug response markers in order to implement the application of precision medicine in AML patients.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of intact tissue has improved the understanding of these processes, by providing an in-depth view of the human liver proteome. However, the predominance of parenchymal cells, i.e. hepatocytes, means that the total tissue proteome mainly reflects hepatocyte expression. In this study, we therefore used quantitative label-free proteomic analysis to analyze the proteomes of the major parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell types in the human liver, i.e. hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells. We found that our data recapitulated specific functional differences between cell types, meaning that it can be used to reliably probe various aspects of cellular interplay.

Extensive vesiculation impairs function and survival of red blood cells after transfusion, and microvesicles contribute to transfusion reactions. The triggers and mechanism of microvesicle generation are largely unknown. In this study, we combined morphological, immunochemical, proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic analyses in order to obtain an integrated understanding of the mechanisms underlying microvesicle generation during storage of red blood cell concentrates. Our data indicate that changes in membrane organization, triggered by altered protein conformation, constitute the main mechanism of vesiculation, and precede changes in lipid organization. The resulting selective accumulation of membrane components in microvesicles is accompanied by the recruitment of plasma proteins involved in inflammation and coagulation. Our data may serve as a basis for further dissection of the fundamental mechanisms of red blood cell aging and vesiculation, for identifying the cause-effect relationship between blood bank storage and transfusion complications, and for assessing the role of microvesicles in pathologies affecting red blood cells.

Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to immunosurveillance and first-line defense in the control of tumor growth and metastasis diffusion. NKEVs are constitutively secreted, are biologically active, reflect the protein and genetic repertoire of their originating cells and exert anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. NKEVs from tumor-conditioned NK cells interact with na�ve NK cells promoting their cytotoxic activity. In cancer NK cells exhibit profound defects in degranulation ability, a status probably reflected by their NKEVs. Hence, NKEVs could contribute to improve cancer therapy by interacting with tumor and/or immune cells at the same time sensing the actual NK cell status in cancer patients.  Here we investigated the role of NKEVs in stimulating the immune system and developed an immune enzymatic test (NKExoELISA) to sense the systemic NK cell status by measuring plasma NK-derived exosomes through combined capture of exosomes, expressing typical EV (tsg101) and NK cell (CD56) markers. We analyzed by LC-MS/MS the protein content from NKEVs evaluating  proteins differentially expressed in exosomes (NKExo), vescicles (NKMV)  and total cell extract (Tot extr) from parental NK cells.

PXD013649	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD013649	non-canonical HLA peptides in cancer	Efforts to precisely identify tumor human leukocyte antigen presented peptides (HLAp) capable of mediating T cell based tumor rejection still face important challenges. Recent reports suggest that non-canonical cancer HLAp could be immunogenic but their identification requires highly sensitive and accurate mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteogenomics approaches. Here, we present a novel MS-based analytical pipeline that can precisely characterize the non-canonical HLAp repertoire, incorporating whole exome sequencing, bulk and single cell transcriptomics, ribosome profiling, and a combination of two MS/MS search tools. This approach results in the accurate identification of hundreds of shared and tumor-specific non-canonical HLAp. Albeit often at low levels and in distinct subpopulations of cells, numerous non-canonical HLAp are shared across tumors. This analytical platform holds great promise for the discovery of novel cancer antigens for cancer immunotherapy.

Both Andromeda and Comet provided good results in preliminary tests, their scoring methods performed well for HLAp peptides, and they allowed searching for peptides with and without variants. Andromeda matched the MS/MS spectra of each sample against their personalized reference libraries (mentioned above). Similarly, the variants were annotated in the PEFF format (http://www.psidev.info/peff) for Comet. Both search tools were run with the same principal search parameters: precursor mass tolerance 20ppm, MS/MS fragment tolerance 0.02 Da, peptide length 8-15 for HLA-I only and 8-25 for HLA-I and HLA-II peptides, Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term) as variable modifications and no fixed modifications. A PSM FDR of 3% was used for Andromeda as a first filter, and nonc reference sequences were loaded into the �proteogenomics fasta files� module for separate FDR calculations for prot and nonc sequences. To assure that nonc peptide sequences do not match other protein coding genes, all peptides found by Andromeda or Comet were aligned against the UniProt (www.uniprot.org) sequence database (human reviewed sequences with isoforms, downloaded 18/12/2018), where leucine and iso-leucines were treated as equal since they are not distinguishable by mass spectrometry. If peptides were found matching standard UniProt sequences, they were assigned as prot with the UniProt IDs. However, we assigned and kept TE peptide sequences that matched  annotated TEs that were integrated into the human reference in UniProt.  As schematically described in Supplementary Figure 1, the Comet FDR calculation was done separately for prot and nonc PSMs with an in-house software written in Java, which utilizes the MzJava class library77. All PSMs resulting from the Comet search, including the decoy PSMs (decoy hits originating from reversed sequences), were split into three sublists with PSMs of charge (Z) 1, 2, and charge 3 or higher. The three Comet scores XCorr, deltaCn and spScore were considered. It has been shown that when feature vectors are partitioned into different groups, group-wise local FDR (lFDR) calculation provides the most sensitive decision boundaries, for controlling the global FDR78. Therefore, the 3D space (XCorr, deltaCn and spScore) was partitioned into small cells (40 intervals in each dimension) and the lFDR was estimated for each cell. We used the following equation to calculate the lFDR:  (1) lFDR(x,Z)=(?_0 p(x?Z,H=0))/(?_0 p(x?Z,H=0)+?_1 p(x?Z,H=1) )=(1+?_1/?_0 ?(p(x?Z,H=1))/(p(x?Z,H=0) ))^(-1) =(1+?_1/?_0  ?(x,Z))^(-1)         where ?_0 and ?_1 are the class probabilities for true (H=1) and wrong (H=0) PSMs, and  p(x?Z,H=0,1) are the probability distributions for feature vector  x=(XCorr,deltaCn,spScore) of PSMs with charge Z. The probability ratio ?(x,Z) is estimated for every cell and charge using all the target and decoy PSMs. The ?_1??_0  ratios are calculated for the nonc and prot groups separately and then the ?_1??_0  ratios are plugged into Equation (1). This way the lFDR values are calculated for every cell for both groups. For each cell, the number of wrong hits (n0) is set to the number of decoy hits in that cell, while the number of true hits (n1) is set to the number of target hits minus n0. These counts are then smoothed by replacing the values to average counts of the neighboring cells. Then ?(x,Z)=n_1?n_0  or ?(x,Z)=1 if n0 = 0. The target and decoy PSMs are further split into nonc and prot PSMs. Since there usually are not enough PSMs to estimate ?(x,Z) for the nonc group, ?(x,Z) is taken from all PSMs but ?_1??_0  is adapted for each group. Therefore, it is assumed that the score distributions are the same for each group, but that the ratio of true to wrong PSMs may change. The ?_1??_0  ratios are calculated for the nonc and prot groups separately and then the ?_1??_0  ratios are plugged into Equation (1). This way the lFDR values are calculated for every cell for both groups separately. The ?_1??_0  ratio in the nonc group is relatively smaller than the prot ?_1??_0  ratio, because the nonc database is larger and mostly consists of peptides that are not present in the sample.  This will lead to a larger nonc lFDR value, and to a more conservative filtering of nonc PSMs. Finally, the lFDR threshold is adjusted to allow a global FDR of 1% for the nonc and prot groups. PSMs from both search tools were combined and only the intersection, meaning PSMs with identical Comet and Andromeda matches (same peptide sequence with the same modification) were retained.	17/01/2020	"[[""DOI:10.1038/s41467-020-14968-9"",""PMID:32157095""]]"

Here, we determine epigenetic changes and genes involved in hemispheric asymmetry in the healthy and PD brain. Neurons of healthy individuals exhibit numerous hemispheric differences in DNA methylation, affecting genes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. In PD patients, hemispheric asymmetry in DNA methylation is even greater and involves many PD risk genes. Moreover, the lateralization of clinical PD symptoms involves epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic differences across hemispheres that affect neurodevelopment, immune activation, and synaptic transmission. In aging, healthy neurons demonstrate a progressive loss of hemisphere asymmetry in epigenomes that is amplified in PD. For PD patients, a long disease course is associated with retaining more hemispheric asymmetry in neuronal epigenomes. Hemispheric differences in epigenetic gene regulation are prevalent in neurons and may affect the progression and symptoms of PD.

PXD013038	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD013038	CDK1 and CDK2 regulate NICD1 turnover  and the periodicity of the segmentation clock	All vertebrates share a segmented body axis. Segments form from the rostral end of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) with a periodicity that is regulated by the segmentation clock. The segmentation clock is a molecular oscillator that exhibits dynamic clock gene expression across the PSM with a periodicity that matches somite formation. Notch signalling is crucial to this process. Altering Notch intracellular domain (NICD) stability affects both the clock period and somite size. However, the mechanism by which NICD stability is regulated in this context is unclear. We identified a highly conserved site crucial for NICD recognition by the SCF E3 ligase, which targets NICD for degradation. We demonstrate both CDK1 and CDK2 can phosphorylate NICD in the domain where this crucial residue lies and that NICD levels vary in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Inhibiting CDK1 or CDK2 activity increases NICD levels both in vitro and in vivo, leading to a delay of clock gene oscillations and an increase in somite size.

PXD015518	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD015518	A fibroblast-specific genome-scale model focused on fatty acid alpha-oxidation	Refsum disease is an inborn error of metabolism that is characterized by a defect in peroxisomal ?-oxidation of the branched-chain fatty acid phytanic acid. After clinical suspicion of this disorder, including progressive retinitis pigmentosa and polyneuropathy, Refsum disease is biochemically diagnosed by elevated levels of phytanic acid in plasma and tissues of the patient. To date, no cure exists for Refsum disease, but phytanic acid levels in patients can be reduced by plasmapheresis and a strict diet. In recent years, computational models have become valuable tools to provide insight into the complex behaviour of metabolic networks. Besides the comprehensive models that contain all known metabolic reactions within the human body, several tissue- and cell-type-specific models have been developed. However, while systems biology approaches are widely used for complex diseases, only few studies have been published for inborn errors of metabolism. In this study, we reconstructed a fibroblast-specific genome-scale model based on the recently published, FAD-curated model, based on Recon3D reconstruction. We used transcriptomics, exo-metabolomics, and proteomics data, which we obtained from healthy controls and Refsum disease patient fibroblasts incubated with phytol, a precursor of phytanic acid. Our model correctly represents the metabolism of phytanic acid and displays fibroblast-specific metabolic functions. Using this model, we investigated the metabolic phenotype of Refsum disease at the genome scale, and we studied the effect of phytanic acid on cell metabolism. We identified 20 metabolites that were predicted to discriminate between Healthy and Refsum�s Disease patients, whereof several with a link to amino acid metabolism. Ultimately, these insights in metabolic changes may provide leads for pathophysiology and therapy.

PXD014524	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD014524	A simple peptide quantification approach for MS-based proteomics quality control	Despite its growing popularity and use, bottom-up proteomics remains a complex analytical methodology. Its general workflow consists of three main steps: sample preparation, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and computational data analysis. Quality assessment of the different steps and components of this workflow is instrumental to identify technical flaws and to avoid loss of precious measurement time and sample material. However, assessment of the extent of sample losses along the sample preparation protocol, in particular after proteolytic digestion, is not yet routinely implemented because of the lack of an accurate and straightforward method to quantify peptides. Here, we report on the use of a microfluidic UV/visible spectrophotometer to quantify MS-ready peptides directly in MS loading solvent, consuming only 2 �l of sample. We compared the performance of the microfluidic spectrophotometer with a standard device and determined the optimal sample amount for LC-MS/MS analysis on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer using a dilution series of a commercial K562 cell digest. Careful evaluation of selected LC and MS parameters allowed us to define 3 �g as an optimal peptide amount to be injected on this particular LC-MS/MS system. Finally, using tryptic digests from human HEK293T cells and showed that injecting equal peptide amounts, rather than approximate ones, results in less variable LC-MS/MS and protein quantification data. The obtained quality improvement together with easy implementation of the approach makes it possible to routinely quantify MS-ready peptides as a next step in daily proteomics quality control.
