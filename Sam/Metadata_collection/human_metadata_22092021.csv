Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""umbilical vein""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Cell type-specific inflammatory response, hallmarks of inflammation, mass spectrometry, primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells, proteomics, secretome","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification.

While EBV generally persists silently in B lymphocytes, periodic lytic (re-)activation of latent virus is central to its life cycle and to most EBV-related diseases. However, a substantial fraction of EBV-infected B cells and tumor cells in a population is refractory to lytic activation. This resistance to lytic activation directly and profoundly impacts viral persistence and effectiveness of oncolytic therapy for EBV+ cancers. To identify the mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to EBV-lytic activation, we used host protein-expression profiling of separated-lytic and -refractory cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Dioxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""425""},{""ptm"":""Dehydrated"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""6x(13)C labeled residue"",""UNIMOD"":""188""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","Epstein-Barr virus, lytic activation, proteomic analysis","Tandem mass spectra were extracted from raw files, and low quality MS/MS spectra were removed based on an empirical classifier. The remaining spectra were searched against Uniprot human protein database (released on February, 2011). To calculate confidence levels and false positive rates, we used a decoy database containing the reverse sequences of annotated protein sequences, and the SEQUEST algorithm to find the best matching sequences using the Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2, Integrated Proteomics Inc., CA).The peptide mass search tolerance was set to 50ppm. No differential modifications were considered. At least half tryptic status was imposed on the database search, so the search space included all candidate peptides whose theoretical mass fell within the 50ppm mass tolerance window. The validity of peptide/spectrum matches was assessed in DTASelect2 using SEQUEST-defined parameters, the cross-correlation score (XCorr) and normalized difference in cross-correlation scores (DeltaCN). The search results were grouped by charge state (+1, +2, and +3) and tryptic status (fully tryptic, half-tryptic, and non-tryptic), resulting in 9 distinct sub-groups. For each one sub-group, the distribution of XCorr and DeltaCN values for (a) direct and (b) decoy database hits was obtained, and the two subsets were separated by quadratic discriminant analysis. Outlier points in the two distributions (for example, matches with very low Xcorr but very high DeltaCN) were discarded. The discriminant score was set such that a false positive rate of 1% was determined based on the number of accepted decoy database peptides. In addition, a minimum sequence length of 7 amino acid residues was required, and each protein on the final list was supported by at least two independent peptide identifications unless specified.

Afterwards each probe was divided into three parts with equal protein amounts of 5µg. Each part was labeled with a specific dye for DIGE preparations (CYDYE DIGE Fluor CY3/CY5, VWR, Darmstadt, Germany). An internal standard was generated through mixing 5µg protein of each probe and labeling with CY2 (CYDYE DIGE Fluor, VWR, Darmstadt, Germany). After labeling, probes were loaded onto pH stripes (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) for the protein separation in the first dimension (isoelectric point). Then proteins were separated in the second dimension (molecular weight, standard SDS-PAGE). The experiments were performed in triplicates. Including the standards, 36 gels were obtained.

Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not in HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80% convergence of protein identifications, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem affect the extent of protein regulation. For example, while a clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon arsenic treatment, such an effect was lacking in HCT116 cells and the latter express drastically higher levels of the involved redox proteins. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anticancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537) by means of functional groups of proteins and mapped their effects according to DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. We were able to characterize the global effects of these metallodrugs on the proteome and generate hypotheses on hitherto unrecognized mechanisms. Significant differences in the two colon cell lines strongly suggest that knowledge of mechanistic hallmarks of anticancer metallodrug action are imperative for the design of clinical studies and that outcome may be enhanced by means of patient stratification strategies according to these hallmarks.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""SW-480 cell"",""colon""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"functional protein groups, mechanism of action, metallodrug, response profiling, proteome profiling","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification.

Tyrosine nitration is a unique type of post translational modification that occurs in the setting of inflammation and nitrosative stress. To date, the significance and functional implications of tyrosine nitration of complement factor H (CFH), a key complement regulator in the eye has not been explored, and is examined in this study in the context of AMD pathogenesis. Sections of eyes from deceased individuals with AMD (n = 5) demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive nitrotyrosine CFH. We purified nitrated CFH from retinae from 2 AMD patients. Mass spectrometry of CFH isolated from AMD eyes revealed residues in domains critical for binding to heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), lipid peroxidation by-products and complement (C) 3b were nitrated. Functional studies revealed that nitrated CFH did not bind to lipid peroxidation products, nor to the GAG of perlecan nor to C3b. There was loss of cofactor activity for Factor I mediated cleavage of C3b with nitrated CFH compared to non-nitrated CFH. CFH inhibits, but nitrated CFH significantly potentiates, the secretion of the pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokine IL-8 from monocytes that have been stimulated with lipid peroxidation by-products. AMD patients (n = 30) and controls (n = 30) were used to measure plasma nitrated CFH using a novel ELISA. AMD patients had significantly elevated nitrated CFH levels compared to controls (p = 0.0117).

PXD009252,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009252,A mass spectrometry-based predictive strategy reveals ADAP1 is phosphorylated at Tyrosine 364.,"Abstract Rationale The goal of this work was to identify phosphorylation sites within the amino acid sequence of human ADAP1. Using traditional mass spectrometry-based techniques we were unable to produce interpretable spectra demonstrating modification by phosphorylation. This prompted us to employ a strategy in which phosphorylated peptides were first predicted using peptide mapping followed by targeted MS/MS acquisition. Methods ADAP1 was immunoprecipitated from extracts of HEK293 cells stably-transfected with ADAP1 cDNA. Immunoprecipitated ADAP1 was digested with proteolytic enzymes and analyzed by LC-MS in MS1 mode by high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS). Peptide molecular features were extracted using an untargeted data mining algorithm. Extracted peptide neutral masses were matched against the ADAP1 amino acid sequence with phosphorylation included as a predicted modification. Peptides with predicted phosphorylation sites were analyzed by targeted LC-MS2. Acquired MS2 spectra were then analyzed using database search engines to confirm phosphorylation. Spectra of phosphorylated peptides were validated by manual interpretation. Further confirmation was performed by manipulating phospho-peptide abundance using calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) and the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Results Of five predicted phosphopeptides, one, comprised of the sequence AVDRPMLPQEYAVEAHFK, was confirmed to be phosphorylated on a Tyrosine at position 364. Pre-treatment of cells with PMA prior to immunoprecipitation increased the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide as determined by area counts of extracted ion chromatograms (EIC). Addition of CIP to immunoprecipitation reactions eliminated the phosphorylated form.  Conclusions A novel phosphorylation site was identified at Tyrosine 364. Phosphorylation at this site is increased by treatment with PMA. PMA promotes membrane translocation and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), indicating that Tyrosine 364 is phosphorylated by a PKC-dependent mechanism.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""6520 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"ADAP1, phosphorylation","Peptide molecular features were extracted using the Find by Molecular Feature algorithm in Mass Hunter software (Agilent Technologies).

In summary, pre-concentration of peptides was carried out on a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 100 μm x 2 cm, C18, 5 μm, 100 Å) within 7 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min with 0.1% TFA. Peptides were then transferred onto an analytical column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC, 75 μm x 50 cm, nano Viper, C18, 2 μm, 100 Å). There, peptide separation was achieved with a gradient from 5-40% solvent B over 98 min at 400 nl/min at 60°C (solvent A: 0.1% FA, solvent B: 0.1% FA, 84% acetonitrile). MS/MS spectra were acquired in a data-dependent mode. Full scan mass spectra in the Orbitrap analyzer were acquired in profile mode at a resolution of 60,000 at 400 m/z and within a mass range of 350-2000 m/z. For MS/MS measurements, the twenty most abundant peptide ions were fragmented by CID and measured for tandem mass spectra in the linear ion trap. Protein identification happened via Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The spectra were searched against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (Release 2015_10; 70,075 entries) via Mascot (ver.2.5, Matrix Science). For taxonomy the chosen setting was homo sapiens and for mass tolerance it was 5 ppm for precursor ions and 0.4 Da for fragment ions. Dynamic modifications were considered for methionine (oxidation) and static modifications for cysteine (carbamidomethyl).

An in-house written R-script was applied to the normalized protein abundances obtained from the software for t-test calculations. Fold changes between groups were determined based on normalized abundances, whereas t-test calculations used arcsinh-transformed data for consistency with the Progenesis QI software.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method.

Milk from the mothers contained almost two hundred distinct peptides, demonstrating enzymatic degradation of milk proteins beginning either during lactation or between milk collection and feeding. In the gastric samples, 649 milk peptides were identified, demonstrating that digestion continues in the infant stomach. The majority of peptides in both the intact milk and gastric samples were derived from β-casein. The numbers of peptides from β-casein, lactoferrin, α-lactalbumin, lactadherin, κ-casein, serum albumin, bile-salt associated lipase and xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase were significantly higher in the gastric samples than the milk samples (p<0.05). Six hundred three peptides were significantly different in abundance between milk and gastric samples (p<0.05). Most of the identified peptides have previously identified biological activity.

The gradient employed was ramped from 0–8% B from 0–5 min, 8–26.5% B from 5–24 min, 26.5–100% B from 24–48 min, followed by 100% B for 2 min and 100% A for 10 min (to re-equilibrate the column). Each sample was run in triplicate on the Q-TOF in MS-only mode.  Creation of peptide library. To create a peptide library, these gastric and intact samples for term-delivered infants were run using the same method. Data were exported to Mascot Generic Format (.mgf) and analyzed via the downloadable version of X!Tandem (thegpm.org) against a library of human milk proteins derived from previous human milk proteomes. Briefly, no complete modifications were required, but possible phosphorylations of serine, threonine or tyrosine, deamidation of glutamine or asparagine, and oxidation of methionine or tryptophan were allowed. Error tolerances employed were 20 ppm for precursor masses and 40 ppm for fragment masses.  The results from X!Tandem for all samples were compiled for milk samples and for gastric samples, separately. Peptides with e-values ≤ 0.01 were removed (a 99% confidence level threshold). To isolate only unique peptide sequences, all duplicates of sequence, protein and modifications combined were eliminated with the “remove duplicates” function in Excel. Peptides representing identical amino acid sequences and modifications but modified in different positions were also removed as duplicates. The compiled peptide libraries were then used to make an exclusion list for recursive analysis. Recursive analysis was repeated until the number of new peptides returned for each sample was ≤10. Three rounds of recursive analysis were completed for the milk samples (for a total of four MS/MS runs for each). Five rounds were completed for two of the gastric samples (for a total of six MS/MS runs for each). One gastric sample with retention times repeatedly different than the other two gastric samples was examined alone—and required ten rounds of recursive analysis before the number of new peptides returned was ≤10. Peptides were identified via the above procedure and the results from the recursive analysis were added to the original peptide results. Peptide identification. Compounds were identified from all samples by the “Batch Targeted Feature Extraction” function in Agilent MassHunter Profinder B.06.00. The data were searched against the peptide library based on the molecular formula. One library generated from milk peptide library was used to extract milk sample peptide peak areas and two different libraries were used to extract the gastric peptides (as one sample had consistently different retention times). The milk peptide library could not be applied to the gastric samples because they showed retention time shifts in comparison with the milk peptides, likely due to molecular interactions within the sample matrices. For library searching, the following parameters were employed. The maximum number of matches per formula was 1. Peaks were matched on both mass (within 20 ppm error) and retention time (within 1 min error). A height threshold of 500 ion counts was employed. The charge carrier was protons, and the allowed charge states were 1-7.  The isotope model was “peptides.” Extracted ion chromatogram peaks were smoothed with the Gaussian function and the resulting peaks were integrated via the “agile” algorithm.

Here we report a novel role for the multifunctional adaptor protein ALG-2-interacting protein X (ALIX) in regulating MS orientation in addition to its well-established role in cytokinesis. We show that ALIX is recruited to the pericentriolar material (PCM) of the centrosomes and promotes correct orientation of the MS in asymmetrically dividing Drosophila stem cells and epithelial cells, and symmetrically dividing Drosophila and human epithelial cells. ALIX-deprived cells display defective formation of astral microtubules (MTs), which results in abnormal MS orientation. Specifically, ALIX is recruited to the PCM via Drosophila Spindle defective 2 (DSpd-2)/Cep192, where ALIX promotes accumulation of g-tubulin and thus facilitates efficient nucleation of astral MTs. In addition, ALIX promotes MT stability by recruiting Microtubule Associated Protein 1S (MAP1S), which stabilizes newly formed MTs. Altogether, our results demonstrate a novel evolutionarily conserved role of ALIX in providing robustness to the orientation of the MS by promoting astral MT formation during asymmetric and symmetric cell division.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]",,"ALIX, mitotic spindle orientation, microtubule, g-tubulin, MAP1S","The resulting MS raw files were submitted for protein identification using Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (ThermoFisher) and Mascot 2.4 (MatrixScience) search engine.

However, the physiological effects of statins are diverse and not all are related to LDL-C lowering. We performed a small clinical pilot study to assess the impact of statins on lipoprotein-associated proteins in healthy individuals (n=10) with normal LDL-C (<130 mg/dL), who were treated with rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) for 28 days. Proteomic analysis of size-exclusion chromatography isolated LDL, HDL-L (large) and HDL-S (small) fractions and spectral counting was used to compare relative protein detection before and after statin therapy. Significant protein changes were found in each lipoprotein pool and included both increases and decreases in several proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism, complement regulation and acute phase response. The most dramatic effect of the rosuvastatin treatment was an increase in alpha-1-antirypsin (A1AT) spectral counts associated with HDL-L particles. Quantitative measurement by ELISA confirmed an average 5.7-fold increase in HDL-L associated A1AT. Molecular modeling predictions indicated that the hydrophobic reactive center loop of A1AT, the functional domain responsible for its protease inhibitor activity, is likely involved in its lipid binding and its association with HDL was found to protect A1AT against oxidative inactivation. Cell culture experiments, using J774 macrophages, demonstrated that the association of A1AT with HDL enhances its anti-protease activity, preventing elastase induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha. In conclusion, we show that statins can significantly alter the protein composition of both LDL and HDL and our studies reveal a novel functional relationship between A1AT and HDL. The upregulation of A1AT on HDL enhances its anti-inflammatory functionality, which may contribute to the non-lipid lowering beneficial effects of statins.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood plasma""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","Rosuvastatin, statin, lipoprotein, HDL, LDL","Samples were analyzed using a Thermo Orbitrap Velos instrument.

Using shotgun proteomics, known marker molecules including PMEL, CRP, SAA and CSPG4 were found deregulated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Targeted analysis of 58 selected proteins with multiple reaction monitoring was applied for independent data verification. In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood serum""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Metastatic melanoma, serum analysis, cachexia, damage signature, calcium mobilization, platelet activation, mass spectrometry, shotgun proteomics","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification.

Moreover, MTRP enables simultaneous comparison of seven structurally diversified -unsaturated -lactones, which provides insights into the relative proteomic reactivity and target preference of diverse structural scaffolds coupled to a common electrophilic motif and reveals various potential druggable targets with liganded cysteines.

It is not clear whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) also define cardiovascular cell-type specific phenotypes, especially in the vascular endothelium. Here, we report the existence of a set of EC-enriched lncRNAs and define a role for STEEL (spliced transcript – endothelial enriched lncRNA) in angiogenic potential, macrovascular/microvascular identity and shear stress responsiveness. STEEL is expressed from the terminus of the HOXD locus and is transcribed antisense to HOXD transcription factors. STEEL RNA increases the number and integrity of de novo perfused microvessels in an in vivo model and augments angiogenesis in vitro. The STEEL RNA is polyadenylated, nuclear-enriched and has microvascular predominance. Functionally, STEEL regulates a number of genes in diverse endothelial cells. Of interest, STEEL upregulates both eNOS and the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), and is subject to feedback inhibition by both eNOS and shear-augmented KLF2. Mechanistically, STEEL upregulation of eNOS and KLF2 is transcriptionally mediated, in part, via interaction of chromatin-associated STEEL with the poly-ADP ribosylase, PARP1. For instance, STEEL recruits PARP1 to the KLF2 promoter. This work identifies a role for EC-enriched lncRNAs in the phenotypic adaptation of ECs to both body position and hemodynamic forces, and establishes a newer role for lncRNAs in the transcriptional regulation of EC identity.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting"",""Label free""]","Long noncoding RNA, Endothelium, Gene Regulations","DATABASE SEARCHING-- Tandem mass spectra were extracted, charge state deconvoluted and deisotoped by Xcalibur version 2.2.

In the main Andromeda search precursor mass and fragment mass had an initial mass tolerance of 6ppm and 20ppm, respectively. The search included fixed modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids and a maximum of 2 miscleavages was allowed. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.01 for peptide/protein identification.  For the PR analysis across healthy population we used label-free quantification (LFQ) with a minimum of two ratio counts to determine the normalized protein intensity.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, primary human B lymphocytes, shotgun proteomics, aging, glutaminolysis, fatty acid beta oxidation, Q Exactive orbitrap","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

While the typical methods for the determination of biologically relevant but low-abundant molecular species still relies on the use of specific antibodies, mass spectrometry-based methods are now gaining sufficient sensitivity to cope with such challenges. In the current study we have identified several cytokines and chemokines which were induced by inflammatory activation of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Based on the high-resolution mass spectrometry data obtained with a Q Exactive orbitrap, we built an MRM method to quantify the most relevant molecules selected from the screening experiment. Using nano-flow Chip-HPLC coupled to a 6490 triple-quadrupole MS for MRM analyses we achieved calibration curves covering a linear range of four orders of magnitude and detection limits in the low attomol per microliter concentration range. Carryover was consistently less than 0.005%, the accuracy between 80% and 120% and the median coefficient of variation for LC/MS was only 2.2%. When including the variance introduced by biological replicates and the digestion procedure, the coefficient of variation was less than 20% for most peptides. Selection of appropriate marker molecules allowed us to monitor typical cell culture variations such as different cell densities, proliferative states and the occurrence of cell death.

This analysis revealed two proteins that were up-regulated during TD: GSTM3 and GSTP1. These proteins are involved in cell maintenance, survival and stress responses during TD.  We demonstrated that the GSTM3/HPV18 E7 interaction regulates stress adaptation. Furthermore, knockdown of GST proteins showed that they are involved in proliferation and evasion of apoptosis via the NF-kB and MAP kinase pathways during TD.

PXD001574,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001574,Phospho-iTRAQ -  Phospho-iTRAQ: Assessing Isobaric Labels for the Large-Scale Study Of Phosphopeptide Stoichiometry,"One of the most extensively studied protein modifications is phosphorylation, a reversible posttranslational modification (PTM) with a central role in a broad range of cellular processes such as cell metabolism, homeostasis, transcription and apoptosis. Due to their transient character, phosphorylations initiate and propagate signal transduction pathways, making these fundamental to inter- and intracellular communication. Detection of phosphorylation is nevertheless challenging considering the dynamic regulation, low stoichiometry and heterogeneous character of the phosphosites. Numerous dedicated phosphoproteomics workflows have therefore been developed in order to unravel phosphorylation networks and the activity of their modulating enzymes. In these workflows, phosphopeptides are typically enriched prior to mass spectrometry analysis to remove the strong background interference caused by the bulk of non-phosphorylated peptides (3). Apart from requiring thorough optimization and a corresponding high level of expertise of the analyst however, enrichment is also responsible for sample loss and limited quantitation accuracy (4). Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis is furthermore confounded by low ionization efficiency and inferior fragmentation of phosphopeptides. Conventional MS/MS analysis with collision-induced dissociation predominantly results in the neutral loss of the phosphate group, leading to poor sequence coverage due to reduced backbone fragmentation. An additional stage of fragmentation in MS3 or the use of alternative fragmentation technologies such as higher energy C-trap dissociation or electron transfer dissociation can partially facilitate the detection and identification of phosphopeptides (5, 6).  In order to draw accurate biological conclusions it is mandatory to obtain quantitative information on the phospho-modifications. Most quantitative approaches aim to elucidate the relative phosphorylation changes between samples, employing direct label-free comparisons of phospho-enriched fractions, or metabolic or chemical labeling methods such as SILAC, iTRAQ or tandem mass tag (TMT) (4, 6, 7). Such methods however, forego the investigation of phosphorylation stoichiometry, also known as occupancy, since such analysis requires the simultaneous monitoring of the unphosphorylated counterpart (8).  One interesting labeling strategy that is specifically designed to quantify occupancy circumvents the common difficulties of standard phosphopeptide detection by focusing on the non-phosphorylated counterparts of the phosphopeptides (11). Herein, a peptide sample is briefly split in two identical parts which are differentially labeled, preceding a phosphatase treatment of one part and mock-treatment of the other. Immediately afterwards the two parts are recombined for the subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. Dephosphorylation of a phosphopeptide will  induce a 79.979 mass shift resulting in a skewed label ratio in the unphosphorylated peptide’s reporter region which now specifies the phosphorylation stoichiometry (12). Although the principle has been described previously (12-19), only one phosphatase-based workflow was adapted specifically for the large-scale study of a complete lysate whereby known phosphopeptides present in a database were quantified by isotopic labels (20). Here we extend for the first time the isobaric tag equivalent of this approach for the large-scale quantitative phospho-analysis of complex mixtures. The technique was validated on three different instrument platforms on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated HeLa cells (23). We discuss a novel data analysis approach for the discovery of high stoichiometry phosphopeptides in complex peptide mixtures and present a way to interpret the sizable dataset without matching the peptide identifications to a phospho-database. Because all peptides and not only the phosphorylated fraction of the proteome is measured in this approach, instruments with high-speed acquisition capabilities and adequate resolution for accurate reporter quantitation are indispensable. Still, because of the minimal technical variation that is introduced throughout the workflow (as for Wu et.al. (20)), implementation of extensive fractionation and purification steps such as protein gel-electrophoresis and 2DLC at the peptide level allows for more in-depth coverage of the (phospho) proteome. What makes this approach even more attractive, is that the iTRAQ multiplexing allows for a replicate measurement within one experiment, creating a new data analysis workflow that meets the stringent requirements of peptide quantitation. All three instrument panels were able to annotate a large set of known phosphoproteins. Extending the latter sample fractionation and using novel methodologies to avoid dilution of reporter ratios in MSMS will allow for the annotation of increasing numbers of phosphopeptide with increasingly low stoichometries in the future.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""succinylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""64""},{""ptm"":""deaminated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""dehydrated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""iTRAQ4plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"",""UNIMOD"":""24#C""},{""ptm"":""carbamoylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""5""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""methylthiolated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""39""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600"",""Synapt MS"",""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""iTRAQ""]","iTRAQ, phosphoproteomics, PiTRAQ","Data acquisition, recording and pre-processing was carried out with software of the respective mass spectrometer manufacturers. Equally, the raw data was processed by specialized software packages of the vendors: ProteinPilot™ 4.0.8085 for the TripleTof 5600 of ABSciex, Proteome Discoverer 1.4 for the Thermo Scientific QExactive, and PLGS 3.0.1 for the SYNAPT G2-Si of Waters Cooperation. The same software packages were used to export the created peak lists in the MGF format. The database searches of these MGF files were performed with Mascot 2.4.0. (Matrix Science) against the SwissProt Human database (59.084 sequences, supplemented with the sequences of the internal standards). Initially, the prevalence of the most common modifications was explored by an Error Tolerant database search (25). Details an search parameters can be found in Supporting Information 3. The  result files of these searches were exported as Mascot-DAT file formats (Peptide e-value < 0.05), and each run was then imported separately in the Rover software for individual processing (https://code.google.com/p/compomics-rover/) (26). After obtaining Rover statistics on the 114/115 and 116/117 ratios, the data were filtered in order to export the log2 ratios and z-scores of unique or “razor” peptides for consecutive data validation. Data validation and frequency plot distribution of Z-scores (at a bin size of  0.1) was done in Excel, whereby the Z-scores of the four molecular weight fractions of the “R1+R3 extracts” were combined. Additional database searches were performed by changing the variable modifications in order to annotate the “heavy” internal standard phosphopeptides (see Supporting information 3). Phosphoprotein enrichment in the obtained protein lists was assessed by a right-sided Fisher enrichment test at a significance level of 5%. Known phosphoproteins in human were obtained from the PhosphoSitePlus database (www.phosphosite.com). The total number of proteins known in human was estimated based on the described proteins in the PFAM database. Proteins involved in the EGF pathway were identified by querying the BioCarta database.  To assess the relative amount of phosphopeptides present in the lists generated by the Phospho-iTRAQ approach, these lists were compared to the known phosphopeptides present in the PhosphoSitePlus database by means of a protein blast as integrated in the NCBI blast 2.2.28 package. The procedure allowed for partial mappings between Phospho-iTRAQ peptides and the phosphopeptides. That is, stretches of at least 5 amino acids in both peptide sequences had to map unambiguously to each other (irrespective of overhangs that result from e.g. tryptic miscleavages), i.e. no gaps or mutations were allowed in the procedure.  To assess a threshold for filtering out phosphopeptides, we first extracted the Z-scores of all annotated peptides that cannot be phosphorylated: peptides with no serine, threonine or tyrosine (No STY). On the No STY distribution, Z-scores at different quantile levels (1 to 25% on the left site of the distribution), were chosen as a cutoff value (Figure 3, upper panels). To select the phosphopeptides in the data, these Z-score cutoffs were subsequently transposed to the ranked Z-scores of the peptides that have the ability to be phosphorylated (with an STY in the sequence). Different levels, going from the left percentile to the quantiles of the distribution were applied to set the threshold on the 114/115-control sample and the 116/117-EGF treated sample.",2014-12-05,"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:25510630""]]"

The classical approach of separating immunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel digestion is long and labour-intensive. Besides, it is difficult to integrate it with most quantitative MS-based workflows, except for stable isotopic labelling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). This work describes a fast, flexible and quantitative workflow for the discovery of novel proteinprotein interactions. A cleavable cross-linker, dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] (DSP), is utilized to stabilize protein complexes before immunoprecipitation. Protein complex detachment from the antibody is achieved by limited proteolysis. Finally, protein quantitation is performed via 18O labelling. The workflow has been optimized concerning: (i) DSP concentration and (ii) incubation times for limited proteolysis, using the stem cell-associated transcription co-factor ZNF521 as a model target. The interaction of ZNF521 with the core components of the nuclear remodelling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, already reported in the literature, was confirmed.

Only 12% of 422 differentially expressed proteins was identified as such at the mRNA level, demonstrating the importance of direct proteome measurement. Fifty-one proteins discriminated Tregs from Tconvs. This common Treg protein signature indicates altered signaling by TCR-, TNF receptor-, NFB-, PI3 kinase/mTOR-, NFAT- and STAT pathways, and unique cell biological and metabolic features. Another protein signature uniquely identified eTregs and revealed active cell division, apoptosis sensitivity and suppression of NFB- and STAT signaling. eTreg fate appears consolidated by FOXP3 outnumbering its partner transcription factors. These features explain why eTregs cannot produce inflammatory cytokines, whereas transitional FOXP3+ cells can.

PXD008310,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008310,FBXL13 regulates centrosome homeostasis and migration through ubiquitin- mediated proteolysis,"Aberrant centrosome organization with ensuing alterations of microtubule nucleation enables tumor cells to proliferate and invade despite increased genomic instability. CEP192 is a key factors in the initiation process of centrosome duplication and in the control of centrosome microtubule nucleation. However, regulatory means of CEP192 have remained unknown. Here we report that FBXL13, a binding determinant of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-Box)-family E3 ubiquitin ligases, is enriched at centrosomes and interacts with the centrosomal proteins Centrin-2, Centrin-3, CEP152, and CEP192. Among these, CEP192 is specifically targeted for proteasomal degredation by FBXL13.

The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed proteins in the uterosacral ligaments of women with and without pelvic organ prolapse and analyze their relationships to cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of pelvic organ prolapse.   Experimental Design:  Uterosacral ligament connective tissue from four patients with pelvic organ prolapse and four control women underwent iTRAQ analysis followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed proteins.  Differentially expressed proteins were valideated using western blot analysis.   Results:  A total of 1789 unique protein sequences were identified in the uterosacral ligament connective tissues.  88 proteins had expression levels that were significantly different between prolapse and control groups (≥1.2-fold). Ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrated 14 differentially expressed proteins that were associated with ""Connective Tissue Function"". Among them, fibromodulin(FMOD), Collagen alpha-1 (XIV) chain(COL14A1), Calponin-1 (CNN-1), Tenascin (TNC), and Galectin-1(LGALS1 appeared most likely to play a role in the etiology of pelvic organ prolapse.  Conclusions and clinical relevence:  We identified at least 6 proteins not previously associated with the pathogenesis of pelvic organ prolapse with biologic functions that suggest a plausible relationship to the disorder.

Here, we report that downregulation of SIRT2 and upregulation of SIRT1 is a molecular signature of primed hPSCs and that SIRT2 critically regulates metabolic reprogramming during induced pluripotency by targeting glycolytic enzymes including aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase. Remarkably, knockdown of SIRT2 in human fibroblasts resulted in significantly decreased OXPHOS and increased glycolysis. In addition, we found that miR-200c-5p specifically targets SIRT2, downregulating its expression. Furthermore, SIRT2 overexpression in hPSCs significantly affected energy metabolism, altering stem cell functions such as pluripotent differentiation properties. Taken together, our results identify the miR-200c-SIRT2 axis as a key regulator of metabolic reprogramming (Warburg-like effect), via regulation of glycolytic enzymes, during human induced pluripotency and pluripotent stem cell function. To address our hypothesis that acetylation affects the metabolic switch, we compared protein acetylation in hESCs and hDFs by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/ MS) analyses following immunoprecipitation with acetyl-Lys antibody.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""embryo""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"human pluripotent stem cells, acetylation, SIRT2, differentiation","Spectra were searched against the Human IPI v3.7 DB using the Sorcerer 2 IDA Sequest-based search algorithm, and comparative analysis of proteins identified in this study was performed using Scaffold 4.

Through a targeted drug screen, we found the recently approved multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin to have potent activity in several lung cancer cells independent of its intended target, PKC, or a specific genomic marker. To determine the underlying mechanism of action we applied a layered functional proteomics approach and a new data integration method. Using chemical proteomics, we identified multiple midostaurin kinase targets in these cells. Network-based integration of these targets with quantitative tyrosine and global phosphoproteomics data using protein-protein interactions from the STRING database suggested multiple targets are relevant for the mode of action of midostaurin. Subsequent functional validation using RNA interference and selective small molecule probes showed that simultaneous inhibition of TBK1, PDK1 and AURKA was required to elicit midostaurin’s cellular effects. Immunoblot analysis of downstream signaling nodes showed that combined inhibition of these targets altered PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathways that in part converged on PLK1. Furthermore, rational combination of midostaurin with the more potent PLK1 inhibitor BI2536, which is in advanced clinical trials, elicited strong synergy. Our results demonstrate that combination of complementary functional proteomics approaches and subsequent network-based data integration can reveal novel insight into the complex mode of action of multi-kinase inhibitors, actionable targets for drug discovery and cancer vulnerabilities. Finally, we illustrate how this knowledge can be utilized for the rational design of synergistic drug combinations with high potential for clinical translation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lung""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Cancer (B/D-HPP)"",""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""TIC""]","Midostaurin, Lung Cancer, Chemical Proteomics, Drug Pulldown","For the manuscript, data were searched using MaxQuant against annotated protein sequences in the UniProt human database (2018_05, 20350 entries).

Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not in HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80% convergence of protein identifications, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem affect the extent of protein regulation. For example, while a clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon arsenic treatment, such an effect was lacking in HCT116 cells and the latter express drastically higher levels of the involved redox proteins. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anticancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537) by means of functional groups of proteins and mapped their effects according to DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. We were able to characterize the global effects of these metallodrugs on the proteome and generate hypotheses on hitherto unrecognized mechanisms.

Complementary lysis conditions, in situ crosslinking strategies and proximal labeling techniques have been recently developed to address part of this problem. We here demonstrate the use of a viral particle sorting approach as an alternative lysis-free method. By fusing a bait protein to the HIV-1 GAG protein, we show that interaction partners of the bait protein become trapped within virus-like particles (VLPs) that bud from mammalian cells. This so-called Virotrap approach obviates the need for cell homogenization and preserves the protein complexes during purification. Using an efficient VLP enrichment protocol, Virotrap allows the detection of known binary interactions as well as MS-based identification of novel protein partners. In addition, we show the identification of stimulus-dependent interactions and demonstrate trapping of protein partners for small molecules.

To understand resistance mechanisms, we conducted whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 synthetic-viability/resistance screens in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells treated with PARP-inhibitors. Thus, we identified two previously uncharacterized proteins, C20orf196 and FAM35A, whose inactivation confers strong PARP-inhibitor resistance. Mechanistically, we show that C20orf196 and FAM35A form a complex, termed “Shieldin” (SHLD1/2), with FAM35A interacting with single-stranded DNA via its C-terminal OB-fold region. We establish that Shieldin promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) end-joining, acting as the downstream effector of 53BP1/RIF1/MAD2L2 to restrict DSB resection and counteract homologous recombination in BRCA1-deficient cells by antagonising BRCA2/RAD51 loading. Notably, Shieldin inactivation further sensitises BRCA1-deficient cells to cisplatin, suggesting how defining the SHLD1/2 status of BRCA1-deficient tumours might aid patient stratification and yield new treatment opportunities. Highlighting this potential, we document reduced SHLD1/2 expression in human breast cancers displaying intrinsic or acquired PARP-inhibitor resistance.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","C20orf196, FAM35A, Shieldin","Peptide fractions were analyzed on a quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Scientific) equipped with an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific) as described.

Besides, Tau is a central player in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related Tauopathies where it is found aggregated in degenerating neurons. Mechanisms leading to Tau pathology and its progression are far from being elucidated. Among Tau species found in AD brains, several yet unidentified truncated Tau fragments are showed. A major step forward in the understanding of the role of Tau truncation would be to identify the precise cleavage sites of Tau species. This key step is mandatory to generate appropriate experimental tools in order to investigate the impact of each identified truncated-species on Tau function/dysfunction. Here, we achieved an optimized proteomics approach and succeed in identifying a number of new N-terminally truncated-Tau species from human brain. As N-terminal residues of these fragments are located broadly across Tau sequence, one could expect to have different effects on Tau. We initiated cell-based functional studies by analyzing biochemical characteristics of two N-terminally truncated Tau species starting at residues Met11 and Gln124 (accordingly to the longest Tau isoform) regarding Tau microtubule function. Our results surprisingly showed that the ability of Tau to bind and stabilize microtubules was greater when the first 123 residues are truncated, suggesting that Tau N-terminus would have a role in regulation of microtubule stabilization. Overall, future studies based on our new N-terminally truncated-Tau species will provide new knowledge on the role of truncation in Tau biology as well as in AD pathological process.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""brain""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""deaminated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""dehydrated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""thioacylation of primary amines - site N-term"",""UNIMOD"":""126#N-term""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""thioacylation of primary amines - site K"",""UNIMOD"":""126#K""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ FT""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,Tau; Alzheimer's disease; Human; LC MS/MS,"The raw data were processed using Xcalibur 2.0.7 software.

Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not in HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80% convergence of protein identifications, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem affect the extent of protein regulation. For example, while a clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon arsenic treatment, such an effect was lacking in HCT116 cells and the latter express drastically higher levels of the involved redox proteins. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anticancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537) by means of functional groups of proteins and mapped their effects according to DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. We were able to characterize the global effects of these metallodrugs on the proteome and generate hypotheses on hitherto unrecognized mechanisms. Significant differences in the two colon cell lines strongly suggest that knowledge of mechanistic hallmarks of anticancer metallodrug action are imperative for the design of clinical studies and that outcome may be enhanced by means of patient stratification strategies according to these hallmarks.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HCT-116 cell"",""colon""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"functional protein groups, mechanism of action, metallodrug, response profiling, proteome profiling","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification.

Increased expression of USP9X is observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is correlated with poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanism for USP9X regulating tumor cell survival and tumorigenesis in NSCLC is less defined. In this study, chemical labeling quantitative proteomic screening was applied to analyze A549 cells with or without USP9X RNA interference, and the resulting data suggested that TTK is a potential substrate of USP9X. Further experimental evidences confirmed that USP9X stabilized TTK via direct interaction and deubiquitination of TTK. Moreover, knockdown of USP9X or TTK inhibited cell proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis, and the immunohistochemical analysis of clinical NSCLC samples showed that the protein expression levels of USP9X and TTK were significantly elevated and positively correlated in tumor tissues. In summary, our data demonstrated that the USP9X-TTK axis may play a critical role in NSCLC, and could be considered as the potential therapeutic target.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]",non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); quantitative proteomics; deubiquitinase; USP9X; TTK,"The MS data were analyzed using the software MaxQuant (32) (http://maxquant.org/, version 1.5.8.0).

We found the majority of MPs were distributed in low molecular weight (LMW) ranges, especially in 0-40 kDa. The identification of LMW proteins is challenging owing to their low length, low abundancy, and hydrophobicity. Even worse, many sequences from Trypsin digestion are unlikely to yield detectable peptides or composed less number of observable peptides in MS detection. Therefore, we focused on small MPs by combining LMW protein enrichment and mirror-protease strategy on human testis samples. The in-depth testis LMW protein profiling documented 4,063 proteins from which 2,565 proteins were belong to LMW proteins and 1,130 proteins had mirror peptides. This provided mass spectral evidence for small MPs further verification, and two MPs were verified in seven identified MPs. For Q8N688, confident peptides were verified from Trypsin and LysargiNase digestions, and continuous b/y-ion peptide was obtained by mirror-spectrum matching. Two verified peptides of Q86WR6 were from gel-separation and gel-elution dataset, respectively.

The proliferation of these LMW peptides coincides with the earliest stages of cataract formation, suggesting that the protein cleavages involved may contribute to the aggregation and insolubilisation of crystallins – these being hall marks of cataractogenesis. This study reports the identification of 238 endogenous LMW crystallin peptides from the cortical extracts of human lenses aged 16, 44, 75 and 83 years. Analysis of the peptide terminal amino acids showed that Lys and Arg were situated at the C-terminus with significantly higher frequency compared to other residues, suggesting that trypsin-like proteolysis may be active in the lens cortical fibre cells. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) analysis of a prominent αA-crystallin peptide (αA57-65) showed that the concentration of this peptide in the human lens increased gradually to middle age, after which the rate of αA57-65 formation escalated significantly. Using 2-D gel electrophoresis and nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS, 13 protein complexes of 40-150 kDa consisting of multiple crystallin components were characterised from the water soluble cortical extracts of an adult human lens.

PXD007592,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007592,Proteomics-based insights into mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor resistance of cerebral melanoma metastases,"Background MAP kinase inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy for BRAF mutated melanoma is characterized by high response rates but also development of drug resistance within a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9 to 12 months. Understanding mechanisms of resistance and identifying effective therapeutic alternatives is one of the most important scientific challenges in melanoma. Using proteomics, we want to specifically gain insight into the pathophysiological process of cerebral metastases. Methods Cerebral metastases from melanoma patients were prepared for MS analysis by tryptic digestion. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a QExactive HF hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer, equipped with a nanospray ion source, coupled with a nano HPLC system.  Results In this pilot study, we were able to identify 5,977 proteins by LC-MS analysis. Samples were classified into good and poor responders based on PFS. By evaluating these proteomic profiles according to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG pathways and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we could characterize differences between the two distinct groups. We further detected an EMT signature, V-type proton ATPases, calcium ion binding proteins, eukaryotic translation initiation factors, cell adhesion proteins and several transporter and exchanger proteins to be significantly up-regulated in poor responding patients, whereas good responders showed an immune-activation and involvement of extracellular matrix structural constituents, among other features. Subsequently we identified the most class-discriminating proteins based on nearest shrunken centroids. Conclusions Using proteomics helped to identify already known extra-cerebral resistance mechanisms in the cerebral metastases and further discovered possible brain specific mechanisms of drug efflux, which might serve as interesting targets, especially for treatment of these types of metastases or as predictive marker.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""skin""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""L-proline residue"",""UNIMOD"":""320#C""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive HF""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"BRAF mutation, Cerebral melanoma metastases, Drug resistance, Melanoma, MAP kinase inhibitor, Proteomics","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

Neuromelanin pigment is stored in granules including a protein matrix and lipid droplets. Neuromelanin granules are yet only partially characterised regarding their structure and function. To clarify the exact function of neuromelanin granules in humans, their enrichment and in-depth characterization from human substantia nigra is necessary. Previously published global proteome studies of neuromelanin granules in human substantia nigra required high tissue amounts. Due to the limited availability of human brain tissue we established a new method based on laser microdissection combined with mass spectrometry for the isolation and analysis of neuromelanin granules. With this method it is possible for the first time to isolate a sufficient amount of neuromelanin granules for global proteomics analysis from ten 10 µm tissue sections. In total 1,000 proteins were identified associated with neuromelanin granules. More than 68% of those proteins were also identified in previously performed studies. Our results confirm and further extend previously described findings, supporting the connection of neuromelanin granules to iron homeostasis and lysosomes, respectively endosomes. Hence, this method is suitable for the donor specific enrichment and proteomic analysis of neuromelanin granules.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""brain""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biological"",""Human Brain Proteome Project (HUPO_HBPP) (B/D-HPP)""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","neuromelanin, laser microdissection, substantia nigra, LC-MS/MS","Raw files derived from the measurements were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

However, the relationships between the AS and classic oncogenes/tumor suppressors are largely unknown. Here we show that the deletion of tumor suppressor PTEN alters pre-mRNA splicing in its phosphatase-independent manner, and identify262 PTEN-regulated AS events in 293T cells by RNA sequencing, which are associated with significant worse outcome of cancer patients. Based on these findings, we report that nuclear PTEN interacts with the splicing machinery, spliceosome, to regulate its assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. Especially, the exon-2b exclusion of GOLGA2 contributes to PTEN knockdown-induced tumorigenesis by promoting dramatic Golgi extension and secretion, and PTEN depletion significantly sensitizes cancer cells to secretion inhibitors, Brefeldin A and Golgicide A. Given that many cancers lack PTEN expression, our results suggest that Golgi secretion inhibitors alone or in combination with PI3K/Akt kinase inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for PTEN-deficient cancers.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""kidney""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","PTEN, alternative splicing, spliceosome, protein-protein interaction, Golgi, GOLGA2, U2AF2, tumor suppressor","All MS/MS ion spectra were extracted by ProteoWizard msConvert and were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.4.1).

BAP1 and its drosophila orthologue Calypso assemble DUB complexes with ASXL-1, -2, -3 paralogues and ASX respectively, and these cofactors are required for stimulating their DUB activity. However how the DUB activity of BAP1 is regulated remains largely unknown. Here we show that BAP1 promotes monoubiquitination of ASXLs on the ASXM/DEUBAD domain. ASXL2 monoubiquitination promotes its stability or proteasomal degradation, stimulates BAP1 DUB activity and is required for mammalian cell proliferation. Monoubiquitination of ASXL2 is directly catalyzed by UBE2E family of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and is regulated by deubiquitination. Monoubiquitination of ASX is regulated by Calypso and is required for drosophila development. We further revealed a switch mechanism that tightly regulate BAP1 function, as a monoubiquitination of BAP1 UCH domain is mutually exclusive with ASXL2 monoubiquitination, thus ensuring highly coordinated DUB-mediated signaling.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Cancer (B/D-HPP)"",""Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"",""Human Proteome Project"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TIC""]","Histone H2AK119Ub; deubiquitination, Polycomb Group Proteins; BAP1; Calypso; ASXL; cell proliferation","Tandem mass spectra were searched against the UniProt human database with carbamidomethylation (C) as fixed modifications, deamidation (NQ,) oxidation (M) acetylation (N-term) and ubiquitination (K) as variable modifications.

Checkpoint systems allow the accurate execution of each cell cycle phase.  The precise regulation of the levels of cyclin proteins is fundamental to coordinate cell division with checkpoints, avoiding genome instability.  Cyclin F has important functions in regulating the cell cycle during the G2 checkpoint; however, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of cyclin F are poorly understood.  Here, we observe that cyclin F is regulated by proteolysis through β-TrCP.  β-TrCP recognizes cyclin F through a non-canonical degron site (TSGXXS) after its phosphorylation by Casein Kinase II.  The degradation of cyclin F mediated by β-TrCP occurs at the G2/M transition and this event is required to promote mitotic progression and favours the activation of a transcriptional programme required for mitosis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""kidney""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","CK2, Cyclin F, mitotic progression","Raw MS data was processed and analysed using PEAKS software as described previously (Davis et al., 2017).

PXD009302,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009302,Proximity labeling by a recombinant APEX2-FGF1 fusion protein reveals interaction of FGF1 with the proteoglycans CD44 and CSPG4,"Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) binds to specific FGF receptors (FGFRs) at the surface of target cells to initiate intracellular signaling. In addition, FGF1 also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), which act as important co-receptors. Even if some interactions with HSPGs have been characterized, it is not entirely clear if FGF1 could interact with additional proteoglycans at the cell surface. We have devised and tested a method to identify novel binding sites for FGF1 at the cell surface, which may also be applicable for other protein ligands. First, we constructed an APEX2-FGF1 fusion protein to perform proximal biotin labeling of proteins after binding of the fusion protein to cells. After functional validation of the construct, we used this method to identify binding sites for FGF1 on living cells. We confirmed the feasibility of our approach by easy detection of FGFR4, a well-known and specific receptor for FGF1. We then performed a screen in RPE1 cells and among the top hits were the proteoglycans CSPG4 (NG2) and CD44. We found that FGF1 binds CD44 through its heparin-binding moiety. Moreover, we found that FGF1 co-localizes with both CSPG4 and CD44 at the cell surface suggesting that these receptors act as storage molecules creating a reservoir of FGF1. Importantly, our data demonstrate that recombinant ligand-APEX2 fusion proteins can be used to identify novel receptor interactions at the cell-surface.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free"",""APEX - Absolute Protein Expression"",""TIC""]","FGF1, Proximity labeling , proteomics","MS raw files were submitted to MaxQuant software version 1.4.0.8 (Cox 2008) for protein identification using its Andromeda engine.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation.

Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets.

PXD009750,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009750,LC-MSMS of the 10H118 MHC class I immunopeptidome,"MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, leukemic primary sample, LC-MSMS, MHC class I, immunopeptidome","Peptides were identified using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solution Inc.) and peptide sequences were searched against the 10H118 global cancer database that was built using 10H118 RNA-sequencing data (reference genome used: GRCh38.88, total number of proteins in database: 3,772,680).

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""skin""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Cell type-specific inflammatory response, hallmarks of inflammation, mass spectrometry, primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells, proteomics, secretome","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification.

Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not in HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80% convergence of protein identifications, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem affect the extent of protein regulation. For example, while a clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon arsenic treatment, such an effect was lacking in HCT116 cells and the latter express drastically higher levels of the involved redox proteins. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anticancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537) by means of functional groups of proteins and mapped their effects according to DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. We were able to characterize the global effects of these metallodrugs on the proteome and generate hypotheses on hitherto unrecognized mechanisms. Significant differences in the two colon cell lines strongly suggest that knowledge of mechanistic hallmarks of anticancer metallodrug action are imperative for the design of clinical studies and that outcome may be enhanced by means of patient stratification strategies according to these hallmarks.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""SW-480 cell"",""colon""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"functional protein groups, mechanism of action, metallodrug, response profiling, proteome profiling","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification.

The spontaneous reaction with protein amino groups is one of the main causes of glucose toxicity, but the site specificity of this reaction is still poorly understood.  Unbalance of iron metabolism has long been described in DM patients, and one of the main features is the occurrence of non-transferrin-bound iron in the blood serum. The presence of these toxic iron species is observed, despite low transferrin saturation levels. Here in, an in vitro approach was used to study human holo-transferrin glycation in detail. Holo-transferrin was incubated with increasing concentration of glucose (10; 20; 100 and 500 mM) and glycation sites were identified using nano-reverse phase – liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (nLC-MS).

However, its clinical relevance is unclear in breast cancer. In this study, expression of DLC1 was correlated with prognosis using publicly available breast cancer gene expression datasets and quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR in cohorts of Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Mutation and methylation status of DLC1 were assessed in these datasets including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To seek further insights in understanding the role of DLC1 in ER+ breast cancer, we developed a knock-in model of DLC1 in T47D breast cancer cells. Label-free global proteomic and TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment assays were performed and validated using Western blotting. Here, we report that low expression of DLC1 correlates with poor prognosis in patients with ER+ breast cancer with further decrease in metastatic lesions. Analysis of the TCGA data showed that down regulation of DLC1 is not due to methylation or mutations. Stable knock-in of DLC1-full-length inhibits cell growth significantly in vitro compared to its control counterpart. 6726 phosphopeptides were quantified by phosphoproteomics analysis in both conditons, whereas 205 and 122 were unique to DLC1 knock-in and T47D-control cells, respectively. Pathway analysis using DAVID showed the top three significant clusters of differentially identified phosphopeptides involving cell-cell adhesion, mRNA processing and splicing, and transcription regulation. Decreased phosphorylation of epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 (ECT2) at the residue T359, critical for its active conformational change was validated. In conclusion, this data suggests that high expression of DLC1 reduces cell growth and is associated with favorable prognosis. Our results document an inverse relation between ECT2 phosphorylation and DLC1 expression, promising a novel strategy for treating ER+ breast cancer.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TIC""]","Breast cancer, DLC1, phosphoproteome","The resulting RAW files were analyzed in Thermo Proteome Discoverer (PD) 2.2.

MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, leukemic primary sample, LC-MSMS, MHC class I, immunopeptidome","Peptides were identified using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solution Inc.) and peptide sequences were searched against the 07H103 global cancer database that was built using 07H103 RNA-sequencing data (reference genome used: GRCh38.88, total number of proteins in database: 1,385,936).

Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated.

Lifestyle changes especially calorie restriction (CR) reduces the risk for age and obesity-associated complications. The impact of CR on obesity has mainly been examined with human intervention studies, which indicated alterations in circulating adipokines. However, a detailed understanding of CR-induced adipocyte secretome changes remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated the effect of CR on the secretion profile of mature human adipocytes by using proteomics technology with bioinformatic analysis. We demonstrated CR-mediated adipocyte triglyceride reduction, which resulted in a positive effect on adipokine secretion indicating an improved inflammatory phenotype and alleviation of obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction including insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Furthermore, 6 novel adipocyte-secreted proteins were identified which were regulated by CR. Since resveratrol (RSV) mimics CR we compared results from this study with data from our previous RSV study on the adipocyte secretome. We observed that both treatment strategies lead to a less inflammatory phenotype and an altered adipokine profile indicating improvement of metabolic complications even though the CR and RSV adipocyte secretomes differed from each other.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""instrument model"",""LTQ""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Bottom-up proteomics""]",,"human adipocytes, calorie restriction, adipokines, metabolic syndrome, 2-DE LC-MS/MS","LC-ESI-MS/MS, LCQ Xcalibur v2.0 SR2 raw files and spectra were selected from Proteome Discover1.2 software (Thermo Scientific) with the following settings: minimal peak count 50; total intensity threshold 4000; and S/N ≥6.

PXD002565,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD002565,Targeting the lineage-specific long non-coding RNA LINC01212 as an effective anti-melanoma therapeutic strategy,"Focal amplifications of 3p13-3p14 occur in about 10% of melanoma and are associated with poor prognosis. The melanoma-specific oncogene MITF resides at the epicenter of this amplicon1 . However, whether other loci present in this amplicon also contribute to melanomagenesis is unknown. Here we show that the recently annotated long non-coding RNA gene LINC01212 is consistently cogained with MITF. In addition to being amplified, LINC01212 is a target of the lineage-specific transcription factor SOX10 and, consequently, it is expressed in more than 90% of human melanomas, but not in normal adult tissues. Whereas exogenous LINC01212 functions in trans to increase melanoma clonogenic potential, LINC01212 knock-down drastically decreases the viability of melanoma cells irrespective of their transcriptional cell state, BRAF, NRAS or TP53 status and increases their sensitivity to MAPK-targeting therapeutics both in vitro and in Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) models. Mechanistically, LINC01212 interacts with p32, a master regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism, to increase its mitochondrial targeting and pro-oncogenic function. Our results indicate that targeting the lineage addiction oncogene LINC01212, especially in combination with BRAFV600Einhibitors, disrupts vital mitochondrial functions in a cancer-cell specific manner and is therefore expected to deliver highly effective and tissuerestricted anti-melanoma therapeutic responses.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""melanoma cell""]","[{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated lysine"",""UNIMOD"":""35#K""},{""ptm"":""L-methionine sulfoxide"",""UNIMOD"":""35#M""},{""ptm"":""2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"",""UNIMOD"":""28#Q""},{""ptm"":""N-acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]",lncRNA protein binding melanoma,"From the MS/MS data in each LC run, Mascot Generic Files were created using Distiller software (version 2.4.3.3, Matrix Science, www.matrixscience.com/Distiller).

BSCR is also associated with endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP)2, an enzyme involved in processing HLA class I ligands. We analyzed the relationship between both risk factors, to address the basis for their joint association with BSCR. Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry was used to characterize the effects of ERAP2 on the A*29:02-bound peptidome. An ERAP2-negative cell line was transduced with lentiviral constructs containing GFP or GFP-ERAP2, and the A*29:02 peptidomes from mock- and ERAP2-transduced cells were compared. A similar analysis was performed with two A*29:02-positive, ERAP1-concordant, cell lines differing in their expression or not of ERAP2. In both comparisons the presence of ERAP2 affected the following features of the A*29:02 peptidome: 1) Length, with increased amounts of peptides >9-mers, and 2) N-terminal residues, with less ERAP2-susceptible and more hydrophobic ones. The paradoxical effects on peptide length suggest that unproductive binding to ERAP2 might protect some peptides from over-trimming. The influence on N-terminal residues is consistent with a double effect of ERAP2: a direct one on peptide trimming and improved processing in concert with ERAP1. The alterations in the A*29:02 peptidome suggest that the association of ERAP2 with BSCR is through its effects on peptide processing.  These differ from those on the ankylosing spondylitis-associated HLA-B*27. Thus, ERAP2 alters the peptidome of distinct HLA molecules as a function of their specific binding preferences, influencing different pathological outcomes in an allele-dependent way.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","HLA-A*29:02,  Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2),  Birdshot Chorioretinopathy","A*29:02 ligands were identified from non-transduced, GFP-, and ERAP2-transduced PF cells.

Here, we identify  the molecular features in the protein and in heparin required for binding and their effects on the potentiation of TGF-ß1’s activity on hMSCs. Using a proteomics “Protect and Label” approach, lysines K291, K304, K309, K315, K338, K373, K375 and K388 were  identified as being directly involved in binding heparin. Competition assays in an optical biosensor demonstrated that TGF-ß1 does require N- and 6-O-sulfate groups for binding but that 2-O-sulfate groups are unlikely to underpin the interaction. Heparin-derived  oligosaccharides as short as degree of polymerization (dp) 4 have a weak ability to compete for TGF-ß1 binding to heparin, which increases with the length of the oligosaccharide to reach a maximum between dp18 and dp24. In cell-based assays, heparin, 2-O-,  6-O- and N-desulfated re-N-acetylated heparin and oligosaccharides 14–24 saccharides (dp14–24) in length all increased the  phosphorylation of SMAD2 after 6 h of stimulation with TGF-ß1.

Many techniques have been developed to study phosphorylation dynamics, including several mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods. Over the last few decades, substantial developments have been made in MS techniques for the large-scale identification of proteins and their post-translational modifications. Nevertheless, all of the current MS-based techniques for quantifying protein phosphorylation dynamics rely on the measurement of changes in peptide abundance levels and many methods suffer from low confidence in phosphopeptide identification due to poor fragmentation. Here we have optimized an approach for the Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids by Phosphate (SILAP) using [-18O4]ATP in nucleo to determine global site-specific phosphorylation rates. The advantages of this metabolic labeling technique are: increased confidence in phosphorylated peptide identification, direct labeling of phosphorylation sites, measurement phosphorylation rates, and the identification of actively phosphorylated sites in a cell-like environment. In this study we calculated approximate rate constants for over 500 phosphorylation sites based on labeling progress curves. We measured a wide range of phosphorylation rate constants from 0.34 min-1 to 0.001 min-1.  Finally, we applied SILAP to determine sites that have different phosphorylation kinetics during G1/S and M phase. We found that most sites have very similar phosphorylation rates under both conditions; however a small subset of sites on proteins involved in the mitotic spindle were more actively phosphorylated during M phase, while proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription were more actively phosphorylated during G1/S phase.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell"",""HEK-293 cell""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap"",""LTQ Orbitrap Elite"",""Q Exactive""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"LC-MS/MS, Phosphoproteomics, Stable isotope labeling","The data were searched using Mascot (version 2.2.07, Matrix Science, London, UK) and X!Tandem (version 2013.02.01.1, The GPM, thegpm.org) against the human Uniprot database (canonical and isoform sequence data retrieved March 16, 2012, 140,795 sequences), using a mass tolerance of 20 ppm for precursor ions and 0.5 Da for fragment ions. Serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation, methionine oxidation, and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications and cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification. Up to two missed cleavages were allowed for a trypsin digest search. Scaffold (version 4.0.5, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, Or) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. All search results were loaded into Scaffold in a Mud-Pit type setup. Peptide identifications were accepted at over 95% probability and protein identifications were accepted at over 99% probability according to the PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet algorithms. The filtered peptide identifications from Mascot and X!Tandem were loaded into an in-house software program, which uses a nave Bayes model of co-eluting peptides identified in each run to predict retention times of peptides that were not identified in all runs. This is especially important for time course analysis because it fills in time point measurements from runs containing essentially the same peptides, but different sets of MS2 identifications. Phosphorylated peptides from the database searches and our in-house developed software were used to model the isotope distribution for each peptide based on its chemical formula in order to calculate the expected intensity distributions for relevant isotopic labeling states. Isotopic labeling states were defined based on their shared isotopic perturbation, i.e. light phosphorylated peptides with no incorporated 18O, versus heavy phosphorylated peptides with between one and three incorporated 18O. The signal intensities of the raw isotopologue peaks was partitioned between the isotopic labeling states using linear regression. Finally, we determined phosphorylation site localization scores using AScore and used a score cutoff of 20 for assigning confident phosphorylation sites. We used the maximum phosphorylation site localization score to filter peptides identified by more than one MS2 spectrum.  Processed and raw data is made available by deposition in the Chorus repository (https://chorusproject.org/pages/index.html).

However, we currently lack a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for target recruitment and selectivity, which is critically required to enable rational design of degraders. Here we utilize comprehensive characterization of the ligand dependent CRBN/BRD4 interaction to demonstrate that binding between proteins that have not evolved to interact is plastic. Multiple X-ray crystal structures show that plasticity results in several distinct low energy binding conformations, which are selectively bound by ligands. We demonstrate that computational protein-protein docking can reveal the underlying inter-protein contacts and inform the design of the first BRD4 selective degrader that can discriminate between highly homologous BET bromodomains. Our findings that plastic inter-protein contacts confer selectivity for ligand-induced protein dimerization provide a conceptual framework for the development of heterobifunctional ligands.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","PROTAC, ubiquitin, ligase, degrader, crbn","Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Fisher) was used to for .RAW file processing and controlling peptide and protein level false discovery rates, assembling proteins from peptides, and protein quantification from peptides.

PXD006857,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006857,MAZ induces MYB expression during the exit from quiescence via the E2F site in the MYB promoter,"Most E2F-binding sites repress transcription through the recruitment of Retinoblasoma (RB) family members until the end of the G1 cell-cycle phase. Although the MYB promoter contains an E2F-binding site, its transcription is activated shortly after the exit from quiescence, before RB family members inactivation, by unknown mechanisms. We had previously uncovered a nuclear factor distinct from E2F, Myb-sp, whose DNA-binding site overlapped the E2F element and had hypothesized that this factor might overcome the transcriptional repression of MYB by E2F-RB family members. We have purified Myb-sp and discovered that Myc-associated zinc finger proteins (MAZ) are major components. We show that various MAZ isoforms are present in Myb-sp and activate transcription via the MYB-E2F element. Moreover, while forced RB or p130 expression repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter driven by the MYB-E2F element, co-expression of MAZ proteins not only reverted repression, but also activated transcription. Finally, we show that MAZ binds the MYB promoter in vivo, that its binding site is critical for MYB transactivation, and that MAZ knockdown inhibits MYB expression during the exit from quiescence. Together, these data indicate that MAZ is essential to bypass MYB promoter repression by RB family members and to induce MYB expression.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""autoflex""]","[""Biological""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]",,"maz, myb, quiescence, Retinoblasoma","An 0.3 ul aliquot of matrix solution (5 g/l 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 33% aqueous acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was manually deposited onto a 400 um AnchorChip™ MALDI probe and allowed to dry at room temperature.

To address this deficiency, we have used a mass spectrometry-based approach to measure system-wide phosphorylation changes throughout the network with 10 second resolution in the 80 seconds after stimulation in response to a range of 8 growth factor concentrations. Significant changes were observed on proteins far downstream in the network as early as 10 seconds after stimulation, indicating a system capable of transmitting information quickly. Meanwhile, canonical members of the EGFR signaling network fall into clusters with distinct activation patterns. Shc and PI3K phosphorylation levels increase rapidly, but equilibrate within 20 s, while proteins like Gab1 and SHP2 show slower, sustained increases. Proximity ligation assays reveal that Shc and Gab1 phosphorylation patterns are representative of separate timescales for physical association with the receptor. Inhibition of phosphatases with vanadate reveals site-specific regulatory mechanisms, and also uncovers primed activating components in the network, including Src family kinases, whose inhibition impacts only a subset of proteins within the network.

Serum samples were trypsin-digested and fractionated by SCX chromatography prior to SRM and PRM measurements. PRM data obtained by high-resolution mass spectrometry correlated better with ELISA measurements than SRM data measured on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. While all three methods (SRM, PRM, ELISA) were able to quantify HSP90 alpha in serum at the ng/mL level, the use of PRM on a high-resolution mass spectrometer reduced variation. To rule out that the observed differences in SRM and PRM are due to different mass spectrometry systems, the SCX fractions were measured on the same high-resolution instrument (Orbitrap) in the ion trap mode (IT-PRM); such measurements showed that intense co-eluting signals were present in the SRM method, but these interfering peaks were eliminated in the high-resolution PRM mode. Thus, this report shows that it is possible to measure ng/mL levels of HSP90 alpha in a reproducible, selective and sensitive way using PRM.

Although a large number of the observed mutations is believed to be not causally linked with cancer, the functional effects of many rare mutations but also of combinations of driver mutations are often unknown. Here, we perform a systems analysis of a model of EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer resistant to targeted therapy that integrates whole exome sequencing, global time-course discovery phosphoproteomics and computational modeling to identify functionally relevant molecular alterations. Our approach allows for a complexity reduction from over 2,000 genetic events potentially involved in mediating resistance to only 44 phosphoproteins and 35 topologically close genetic alterations. We perform single- and combination-drug testing against the predicted phosphoproteins and discovered that targeting of HSPB1, DBNL and AKT1 showed potent anti-proliferative effects overcoming resistance against EGFR-inhibitory therapy. Our approach may therefore be used to complement mutational profiling to identify functionally relevant molecular aberrations and propose combination therapies across cancers.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lung""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Isotope labeling""]","Lung cancer, Proteomic, System Biology, Drug Resistance","Samples were analyzed in technical replicates using a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) and a U3000 RSLC nano HPLC system (Dionex) coupled to a 50cm long by 75 micron internal diameter EASYspray column.

Many of the RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that aggregate in neurodegenerative diseases, including TDP-43 and FUS, self-assemble into RNA granules through disordered low complexity (LC) domains. We report here that a LC domain within U1-70K, that is comprised of tandem arrays of basic (R/K) and acidic (D/E) residues, shares many of the same properties of the Q/N-rich prion-like LC domains found in TDP-43 and FUS. These properties include the ability to self-assemble into oligomers, and to form nuclear granules in cells. To analyze the functional roles of the U1-70K LC domains, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of recombinant U1-70K and deletions lacking the C-terminal LC domain(s) followed by quantitative proteomics. Using a network-driven approach, functional classes of U1-70K interacting proteins were identified that showed a varying dependency on the U1-70K LC domain(s) for their interaction. We characterize a family of structurally homologous RBPs containing U1-70K LC1-like domains including LUC7L3 and RBM25, which require their respective LC1-like domains for reciprocal interactions with U1-70K and for participation in nuclear RNA granules. Finally, we also show that the LC1 domain of U1-70K can interact with Tau from AD brain supporting a hypothesis that mixed charge structural motifs on U1-70K and other RBPs could mediate cooperative interactions with pathological tau isoforms","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]",U1-70K,"Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

Elution was performed over a 140-minute gradient at a rate of 300 nL/min with buffer B ranging from 3% to 80% (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid and 5% DMSO in water, buffer B: 0.1 % formic and 5% DMSO in acetonitrile). The mass spectrometer cycle was programmed to collect one full MS scan followed by 10 data dependent MS/MS scans. The MS scans (300-1800 m/z range, 1,000,000 AGC, 100 ms maximum ion time) were collected at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200 in profile mode and the MS/MS spectra (2 m/z isolation width, 28 normalized collision energy (NCE), 50,000 AGC target, 50 ms maximum ion time) were acquired at a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200. Dynamic exclusion was set to exclude previous sequenced precursor ions for 30 seconds. Precursor ions with +1, and +6 or higher charge states were excluded from sequencing.  All raw files have been uploaded to the Proteome Xchange consortium. Protein Database Search. Raw data files were analyzed using MaxQuant v1.5.2.8 with Thermo Foundation 2.0 for RAW file reading capability (29). The search engine Andromeda was used to build and search a concatenated target-decoy UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) containing both Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL human reference protein sequences (90,411 target sequences downloaded April 21, 2015), plus 245 contaminant proteins included as a parameter for Andromeda search within MaxQuant (30). Methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da), asparagine and glutamine deamidation (+0.9840 Da), and protein N-terminal acetylation (+42.0106 Da) were variable modifications (up to 5 allowed per peptide); cysteine was assigned a fixed carbamidomethyl modification (+57.0215 Da). Only fully tryptic peptides were considered with up to 2 miscleavages in the database search. A precursor mass tolerance of ±20 ppm was applied prior to mass accuracy calibration and ±4.5 ppm after internal MaxQuant calibration. Other search settings included a maximum peptide mass of 6,000 Da, a minimum peptide length of 6 residues, 0.05 Da tolerance for high resolution MS/MS scans. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide spectral matches, proteins, and site decoy fraction were all set to 1%.

Threshold power Beta for reduction of false positive correlations (i.e. the beneficial effect of enforcing scale free topology) was sampled in increments of 0.5, and as the target scale free topology R² was approached, 0.1. The power selected was the lowest power at which scale free topology R² was approximately 0.80, or in the case of not reaching 0.80, the power at which a horizontal asymptote (plateau) was nearly approached before further increasing the power had a negative effect on scale free topology R².

RNA-binding proteins play central roles in RNA regulation, including translation and turnover. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 is highly expressed in hESCs to maintain their undifferentiated state and prevent default neural fate. Notably, loss of CSDE1 accelerates neural differentiation and potentiates neurogenesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of CSDE1 impairs neural differentiation. We find that CSDE1 post-transcriptionally modulates core components of multiple regulatory nodes of hESC identity, neuroectoderm commitment and neurogenesis. Among these key pro-neural/neuronal factors, CSDE1 binds fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) and vimentin (VIM) mRNAs as well as transcripts involved in neuron projection development regulating their stability and translation. Thus, our results uncover CSDE1 as a central post-transcriptional regulator of hESC identity and neurogenesis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""embryo""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"LC-MS, hESCs, shRNA",All label-free proteomics data sets were analyzed with the MaxQuant software(release 1.5.3.8).

Despite its important role, chemical tools for profiling the composition and dynamics of ER proteins remain very limited because of the labile nature of these proteins. Here, we developed ER-localizable reactive molecules (called ERMs) as tools for ER-focused chemical proteomics. ERMs can spontaneously localize in the ER of living cells and selectively label ER-associated proteins with a combined affinity and imaging tag, enabling tag-mediated ER protein enrichment and identification with liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The ERM probes could be used simultaneously with the nucleus- and mitochondria-localizable reactive molecules previously developed by our group, which enabled orthogonal organellar chemoproteomics in a single biological sample. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes in ER-associated proteins in response to tunicamycin-induced ER stress was performed by combining ER-specific labeling with SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based quantitative MS technology.

We measured perturbations in protein levels resulting from nicotine treatment in four cell lines - HEK, HeLa, PaSC, and SH-SY5Y- in a single experiment using tandem mass tags (TMT10-plex) and high-resolution mass spectrometry. We quantified 8590 proteins across all cell lines. Of these, nicotine increased the abundance of 31 proteins 1.5-fold or greater in all cell lines. Likewise, considering proteins with altered levels in at least 3 of the 4 cell lines, 64 were up-regulated, while 1 was down-regulated. Gene ontology analysis revealed that ~40% of these proteins were membrane-bound, and functioned in transmembrane signaling and receptor activity. We highlighted proteins, including APP, APLP2, LAPTM4B, and NCOA4, which were dysregulated by nicotine in all cell lines investigated and may have implications in downstream signaling pathways, particularly autophagy. Using the outlined methodology, studies in additional (including primary) cell lines will provide further evidence that alterations in the levels of these proteins are indeed a general response to nicotine and thereby merit further investigation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","TMT, Orbitrap Fusion, nicotine, pancreas, SPS-MS3","Data analysis.

FA affects secreted factors from tumor cells, which can modulate tumor microenvironment in favor of tumor survival. However, the secreted factors affected by the increased FA have not been systematically explored. Here, we performed comprehensive secretome profiling of oleate-treated and untreated HepG2 cells. Comparison of the secretomes identified 349 differentially secreted proteins (DSPs; 145 up-regulated and 192 down-regulated) in oleate-treated samples, compared to untreated samples. Functional enrichment and network analyses of the DSPs revealed that the 145 up-regulated secreted proteins by oleate treatment were mainly associated with cell proliferation-related processes, such as lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and ER stress. Based on the network models of the DSPs, we selected four up-regulated secreted proteins (MIF, THBS1, PDIA3, and APOA1) that can represent such processes related to cell proliferation. Thus, our results provided a secretome profile indicative of oleate-induced proliferation of HepG2 cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, Oleate, HepG2, hepatocellular carcinoma","Peptide identification The fragmentation spectra were created based on mzXML file using msconvert (ProteoWizard release: 3.0.4323). MS data were first analyzed using postexperiment-monoisotopic mass refinement (PE-MMR) to assign accurate precursor mass to tandem MS data. MS/MS spectra were searched against a composite database containing UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries of the human reference proteome (UniProtKB release 2015_11, 42,123 entries) and 179 common contaminants in the target-decoy setting using MS-GF+ Beta (v10089) search engine under the following parameters: semi-tryptic, precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. The search results of 24 LC-MS/MS datasets were all combined, and the target-decoy analysis was performed on the combined dataset to obtain peptides with the false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.01.  Label-free peptide quantification To assign MS intensity to peptide identification, an MS intensity-based label-free quantification method was applied to 24 LC-MS/MS datasets. Briefly, through PE-MMR analysis, MS features of a peptide that appeared over a period of LC elution time in an LC-MS/MS experiment were grouped into a unique mass class (UMC). Ideally, each UMC corresponds to a peptide and contains the ions corresponding to the peptide, together with their mass spectral features, such as charge states, abundances (intensity), scan numbers, and measured monoisotopic masses. For each UMC, we obtained the UMC mass by calculating the intensity-weighted average of the monoisotopic masses of all the ions in the UMC. For the peptide corresponding to the UMC, its abundance was estimated as the summation of the abundances of all the ions in the UMC (UMC intensity). The refined precursor masses of the MS/MS spectra by PE-MMR were matched to the UMC masses and then were replaced with those of UMCs. In this process, MS/MS spectra information was linked to the matched UMC. The linked MS/MS spectra were assigned with a peptide sequence (peptide ID) with a FDR ≤0.01 after MS-GF+ searching and target-decoy analysis. The peptide ID was assigned to the UMC, and the UMC intensity was assigned to the peptide ID.  Assignment of UMCs by master accurate mass and time tag database To assign the peptide IDs to unidentified UMCs, the master accurate mass and time tag (AMT) database (DB) was constructed and utilized as described previously. Briefly, the information about UMCs with peptide IDs from 24 LC-MS/MS data (triplicate LC-MS/MS experiments of 8 samples) was compiled into the master AMT-DB. The AMTs are unique peptide sequences whose monoisotopic masses and normalized elution times (NETs) are experimentally determined. For each AMT whose corresponding peptides were measured multiple times, the average mass and the median NET were recorded. We then mapped unidentified UMCs to AMTs in the master AMT DB with ±10 ppm of mass and ±0.02 of NET tolerances, and 3.0 of Excorr threshold. For each unidentified UMC matched to an AMT, the peptide ID for the AMT was assigned to the unidentified UMC, together with all information for the AMT (UMC mass, NET and Excorr).  Alignment of the identified peptides After the assignment of unidentified UMCs using the master AMT DB, we combined the assigned and identified UMCs from LC-MS/MS datasets into an nm alignment table (peptide IDs for n UMCs and UMC intensities in m samples). The missing value in the alignment table means that the peptide was not identified in the corresponding datasets. For the missing values in each row of the table, we further searched for the UMCs that could be matched to the aligned UMCs based on their UMC masses and NETs with the following tolerance: ±10 ppm and ±0.01 across the technical replicates, and ±10 ppm and ±0.02 across the biological replicates, respectively. Quantile normalization was performed for UMC intensities in the alignment table to correct systematic variations of peptide abundances across datasets. To evaluate reproducibility of LC-MS/MS analysis, two types of similarity scores between LC-MS/MS datasets were calculated by measuring the overlap of detected peptides and their intensity values, as previously described",2017-10-04,"[[""DOI:10.1038/s12276-018-0120-3"",""PMID:30076294""]]"

Serum samples were trypsin-digested and fractionated by SCX chromatography prior to SRM and PRM measurements. PRM data obtained by high-resolution mass spectrometry correlated better with ELISA measurements than SRM data measured on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. While all three methods (SRM, PRM, ELISA) were able to quantify HSP90 alpha in serum at the ng/mL level, the use of PRM on a high-resolution mass spectrometer reduced variation. To rule out that the observed differences in SRM and PRM are due to different mass spectrometry systems, the SCX fractions were measured on the same high-resolution instrument (Orbitrap) in the ion trap mode (IT-PRM); such measurements showed that intense co-eluting signals were present in the SRM method, but these interfering peaks were eliminated in the high-resolution PRM mode. Thus, this report shows that it is possible to measure ng/mL levels of HSP90 alpha in a reproducible, selective and sensitive way using PRM.

PXD009751,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009751,LC-MSMS of the 12H018 MHC class I immunopeptidome,"MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, leukemic primary sample, LC-MSMS, MHC class I, immunopeptidome","Peptides were identified using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solution Inc.) and peptide sequences were searched against the 12H018 global cancer database that was built using 12H018 RNA-sequencing data (reference genome used: GRCh38.88, total number of proteins in database: 2,078,101).

In this study, we aim to investigate possible correlations between the surface properties of argon, nitrogen and ammonia/helium plasma-functionalized polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers and their cellular interactions by examining the protein corona patterns of the plasma-treated nanofibers as well as the cell membrane proteins involved in cell proliferation. As a result of the performed plasma treatments, PCL nanofiber morphology was preserved while wettability was improved profoundly after all treatments because of the incorporation of polar surface groups. Depending on the discharge gas, different types of groups are incorporated which influenced the resultant cell-material interactions. Argon plasma-functionalized PCL nanofibers, only enriched by oxygen-containing functional groups, were found to show the best cell-material interactions, followed by N2 and He/NH3 plasma-treated samples. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS clearly indicated an increased protein retention compared to non-treated PCL NFs.

Using shotgun proteomics, known marker molecules including PMEL, CRP, SAA and CSPG4 were found deregulated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Targeted analysis of 58 selected proteins with multiple reaction monitoring was applied for independent data verification. In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood serum""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Metastatic melanoma, serum analysis, cachexia, damage signature, calcium mobilization, platelet activation, mass spectrometry, shotgun proteomics","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification.

Both the production of NAD+ and the metabolic enzymes that require it as a redox cofactor or substrate differ widely in abundance across cell types and conditions. Disruption in the NAD+ supply thus exerts different effects depending on the cellular NAD+ requirements existing in the cell. Pharmacological depletion of NAD+ is actively being pursued in cancer and other diseases but these effects are not fully understood. Here, we combine quantitative proteomics and metabolomics to understand the consequences of disrupting cellular NAD+ levels and find that inhibiting the NAD+ salvage pathway depletes serine biosynthesis from glucose by impeding the NAD+-dependent protein 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). Importantly, breast cancers that depend on PHGDH are exquisitely sensitive to blocking the NAD+ salvage pathway. PHGDH, and the rate-limiting enzyme of NAD+ salvage are also correlated in public tumor proteome and transcript datasets.

PXD005461,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD005461,Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 interactors,"Identification of interactors is a major attempt in cell biology. Not only protein-protein but also protein-carbohydrate interactions are of high relevance for signal transduction in biological systems. Here we aim to identify novel interacting binding partners for the β-galactoside-binding proteins Galectin-1 (Gal-1) and Galectin-3 (Gal-3) in context of the eye disease proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). PVR is one of the most common failures after retinal detachment surgeries and is characterized by the migration, adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) and the subsequent formation of sub- and epiretinal fibrocellular membranes. Gal-1 and Gal-3 bind in a dose- and carbohydrate-dependent manner to mesenchymal RPE cells and inhibit cellular processes like attachment and spreading. Yet knowledge about glycan-dependent interactors of Gal-1 and Gal-3 on RPE cells is very limited, although this is a prerequisite to unravel the influence of galectins on distinct cellular processes in RPE cells. In this approach, we identified by galectin pull-down experiments and quantitative proteomic screening 131 Galectin-3 and 15 Galectin-1 interactors. They mainly play a role in multiple binding processes and are mostly membrane proteins. Here we focused on two novel identified interactors of Gal-1 and Gal-3 in the context of PVR: the low-density lipoprotein receptor LRP1 and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta PDGFRB. We observed crosslinking and lattice formation of exogenous Gal-1 and Gal-3 with LRP1/PDGFRB and ITGB1 on the cell surface of human RPE cells. Weaker binding of Gal-1 and Gal-3 on these interactors and no lattice formation on the cell surface was seen, when complex-type-N-glycosylation was inhibited by treatment of the cells with Kifunensine. In conclusion, the identified specific glycoprotein ligands for Gal-1 and Gal-3 give us new insights in the highly specific binding of galectins to dedifferentiated RPE cells and the resulting prevention of PVR-associated cellular events.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap XL""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","galectin, pull-down, retina, interactors","The acquired spectra of the different samples were analyzed using Progenesis QI software for proteomics (Version 2.0, Nonlinear Dynamics, Waters, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K.) for precursor intensity-based label-free quantification, as previously described 65-68.

PXD004059,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD004059,Mass spectrometry insights into a tandem ubiquitin‐binding domain hybrid engineered for the selective recognition of unanchored polyubiquitin,"Unanchored polyubiquitin chains are emerging as important regulators of cellular physiology with diverse roles paralleling those of substrate-conjugated polyubiquitin. However tools able to discriminate unanchored polyubiquitin chains of different isopeptide linkages have not been described. We describe the design of a linker-optimised ubiquitin-binding domain hybrid (t-UBD) containing two UBDs, a ZnF-UBP domain in tandem with a linkage-selective UBA domain, which exploits avidity effects to afford selective recognition of unanchored Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains. Utilising native MS to quantitatively probe binding affinities we confirm cooperative binding of the UBDs within the synthetic protein, and desired binding specificity for Lys48-linked ubiquitin dimers. Furthermore MS/MS analyses indicate that the t-UBD, when applied as an affinity enrichment reagent, can be used to favour the purification of endogenous unanchored Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains from mammalian cell extracts. Our study indicates that strategies for the rational design and engineering of polyubiquitin chain-selective binding in non-biological polymers are possible, paving the way for the generation of reagents to probe unanchored polyubiquitin chains of different linkages and more broadly the ‘ubiquitome’.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""GlyGly""},{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Dehydrated"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""LeuArgGlyGly""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Ubiquitin, polyubiquitin","The .raw data file obtained from each LC-MS/MS acquisition was processed using Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4.0.288, Thermo Scientific), searching each file in turn using Mascot (version 2.2.04, Matrix Science Ltd.) against the UniProtKB-Swissprot database.

PXD009752,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009752,LC-MSMS of the lc2 MHC class I immunopeptidome,"MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lung""]","[{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, lung cancer primary sample, LC-MSMS, MHC class I, immunopeptidome","Peptides were identified using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solution Inc.) and peptide sequences were searched against the lc2 global cancer database that was built using lc2 RNA-sequencing data (reference genome used: GRCh38.88, total number of proteins in database: 1,472,228).

One obstacle hindering the elimination of TB is our lack of understanding of host-pathogen interactions. Exosomes, naturally loaded with microbial molecules, are circulating markers of TB. Changes in the host protein composition of exosomes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected cells have not been described, can contribute to our understanding of the disease process, and serve as a direct source of biomarkers or as capture targets to enrich for exosomes containing microbial molecules. Here, the protein composition of exosomes from Mtb-infected and uninfected THP-1-derived macrophages was evaluated by tandem-mass-spectrometry and differences in protein abundances were assessed. Our results show that infection with Mtb leads to significant changes in the protein composition of exosomes. Specifically, 41 proteins were significantly more abundant in exosomes from Mtb-infected cells; 63% of these were predicted to be membrane associated. Thus, we used a novel biotinylation strategy to verify protein localization, and confirmed the localization of some of these proteins in the exosomal membrane. Our findings reveal another important scenario where Mtb could be influencing changes in host cells that unveil new features of the host-pathogen interaction and may also be exploited as a source of biomarkers for TB.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin"",""UNIMOD"":""523""},{""ptm"":""Biotin"",""UNIMOD"":""3""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"biotin, Asp-N","Raw data were converted to mzxml and SEQUEST was set up to search the Uni-Prot Homo sapiens Reference Proteome (ID: UP000005640, 70076 entries) assuming the enzymatic digestion with AspN (before Asp or Glu).

Taking advantage of the distinctive binding affinity of Ga3+ and Fe3+ towards phosphopeptides, we designed a tip-based metal-directed immobilized metal ion affinity (MD-IMAC) chromatography for sequential enrichment of phosphopeptides. On the analysis of Raji B cell, this sequential Ga3+-Fe3+-IMAC strategy demonstrated 1.5-3.5 fold superior phosphoproteomic coverage compared to the single IMAC (Fe3+, Ti4+, Ga3+ and Al3+). In addition, as high as 92% among the 6283 phosphopeptides was uniquely enriched by either 1st Ga3+-IMAC fraction (41%) or 2nd Fe3+-IMAC fraction (51%).  The complementary property of Ga3+ and Fe3+ was further shown on the exclusively superior efficiency to enriched almost all the 1214 multiply phosphorylated peptides (99.4%) by 1st Ga3+-IMAC, while as low as 10% of 5069 monophosphorylated phosphopeptides was commonly enriched by both fractions. Application of our sequential Ga3+-Fe3+-IMAC approach to a human lung cancer tissue allowed the identification of 2560 unique phosphopeptides with only 8% overlapping. The fractionation ability was shown not only on the mono phosphopeptides and multiply phosphopeptides but also on the basic and acidic phosphopeptides; acidiphilic phosphorylation sites were predominately present in 1st Ga3+-IMAC (72%) and 85% Pro-directed and 79% basophilic phosphorylation sites were enriched by 2nd Fe3+-IMAC. Most interestingly, this strategy complementarily mapped different kinase substrate on the protein as well as site levels in multiple cellular pathways related to cancer invasion and metastasis of lung cancer ., Given the demonstrated fractionation ability, reproducibility, sensitivity and ease of tip preparation, we hope that this Ga3+-Fe3+-IMAC allow more comprehensive characterization of phosphoproteome in vitro and in vivo.  Database search: The raw MS/MS data obtained by TripleTOF 5600 were processed using AB_SCIEX MS Data Converter with default parameters. All MS/MS files were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.3) against the SwissPort database (version 57.8) with the following constraints: an allowance for tryptic peptides of up to two missed cleavage sites, a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.05 Da, and a parent ion tolerance of 10 ppm. Phosphorylation (S, T, Y) and oxidation (M) were selected as variable modifications. Searching on a randomized decoy database created by Mascot was required to evaluate the false discovery rate associated with protein identification.

Exosomes are a promising alternative source of biomarkers for TB since they can carry mycobacterial antigens. We hypothesize that exosomes from Mtb-infected macrophages exhibit a characteristic selection of human protein that can be evaluated as TB biomarkers. We looked for the localization—exosomal membrane or lumen—of the differentially abundant proteins. Exosomes were obtained from THP-1-derived macrophages (Mtb infected and uninfected controls). The exosome population was validated by nanoparticle tracking analysis and western blot. The protein composition of exosomes was evaluated by tandem mass spectrometry. Differences in protein composition and abundances between exosomes from infected and control cells were evaluated by t-test the proteomics findings were confirmed by western blot. Using a biotinylation strategy we verified the protein localization. Forty-seven proteins were significantly more abundant in exosomes from Mtb-infected cells, 66% were predicted to be membrane associated. The biotinylation pattern confirmed the membrane-association of some of these proteins.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor - NSAF""]",Mycobacterium tuberculosis; exosomes; membrane proteins; macrophage,"Tandem mass spectra were extracted, charge state deconvoluted and deisotoped by ProteoWizard (MSConvert version 3.0).

Using shotgun proteomics, known marker molecules including PMEL, CRP, SAA and CSPG4 were found deregulated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Targeted analysis of 58 selected proteins with multiple reaction monitoring was applied for independent data verification. In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood serum""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Metastatic melanoma, serum analysis, cachexia, damage signature, calcium mobilization, platelet activation, mass spectrometry, shotgun proteomics","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation. The search result files were loaded into Pinnacle version 1.0.26.0, and the spectral library threshold settings included a Percolator q-value less than 0.05, XCorr scores above 1.5/2.0/2.2 for singly/doubly/triply charged peptides, and a Mascot Ion score > 29. Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).",2016-07-29,"[[""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201600300"",""PMID:28195392""]]"

Here we show the role the ion channel subunit Piezo1 (FAM38A). Disruption of mouse Piezo1 gene disturbed vascular development and was embryonic lethal within days of the heart beating to cause blood flow. Importance of Piezo channels as sensors of blood flow was indicated by Piezo1 dependence of shear stress-evoked ionic current and calcium influx in endothelial cells and the ability of exogenous Piezo1 to confer shear stress sensitivity on cells that otherwise lacked. Downstream of this calcium influx was proteoase activity and spatial organization of endothelial cells to the polarity of the applied force. Without Piezo1, normal endothelial cell organization was lacking.

One of the hallmarks of AIDP pathogenesis is a significantly elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level in comparison with the peptidome/proteome profile of a representative number of CSF samples obtained from AIDP and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and control patients. In total, 2355 peptide fragments related to 795 proteins were found in CSF samples from AIDP patients, 1066 peptide fragments of 253 proteins in samples from MS patients, and 774 peptide fragments of 220 proteins from control patients. Proteomic studies detected 1103 proteins in the control cohort and 1402 proteins in the AIDP cohort. Our dataset suggests that the proteome of the CSF from AIDP and control patients overlaps by as much as 67%, whereas the peptidome is only 21.5% identical. Comparison of the peptidomic and proteomic data revealed that 80% of the peptides in the CSF of AIDP patients correspond to proteins that are not present in proteomic dataset. Importantly, a considerable number of differentially represented peptides are related to the proteins involved in the arrangement of the axonal domains. The observed peptidomic dataset indicates that specific proteins, which participate in the arrangement of the myelin sheath in the nodes of Ranvier, are degraded in the course of AIDP.  Here, we show that the proteins that are overrepresented in the CSF of AIDP patients are partially linked with defensive responses to bacteria and viruses. These observations are in line with the upregulation of CSF cytokines associated with innate immunity, which in turn surprisingly suggests that the destruction of axons is not accompanied by any indications of a distinct adaptive autoimmune process. We believe that the presented proteomic and peptidomic dataset of the CSF from AIDP patients will provide useful information regarding the mechanisms of AIDP pathogenesis in comparison with MS, which is the prolonged but incurable autoimmune degradation of the central nervous system.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cerebrospinal fluid""]","[{""ptm"":""Glu-\u003epyro-Glu"",""UNIMOD"":""27""},{""ptm"":""Dehydrated"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""Amidated"",""UNIMOD"":""2""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Guillain-Barre syndrome, AIDP, cerebrospinal fluid, peptidome","LC-MS/MS data analyses The peak lists from the MS/MS data were generated and recalibrated using ProteinPilot (version 4.5; ABSciex).

PXD008773,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008773,Heterogenous ribonucleoprotein C1 participates in the internalization of Hsa-miR-30d in endometrial exosomes,"Currently, micro RNAs (miRNAs) constitute a promising models for cell-to-cell communication  since they are transferred between cells to execute essential roles in many processes. Their structure and size, in addition to various transport mechanisms, allow them to remain stable within various biological fluids, surviving in extremely adverse conditions, including low pH, boiling, and freezing. The presence of miRNAs in reproductive fluids, such as follicular, uterine and seminal fluid, indicate potential roles in the reproductive system. These extracellular miRNAs can be transported by lipoproteins (both HDL and LDL) or other proteins, including Argonaute2 (AGO2)  and nucleophosmin1 (NPM1). Another transport system is mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as apoptotic bodies, microvesicles (MVs) and/or exosome-like vesicles. EVs protect miRNAs from degradation and contribute to their stability within biological fluids. Furthermore, EVs can transport a wide range of components packaged in a selective way. For instance, Squadrito et al. (2014), used macrophages and endothelial cells to demonstrate that the sorting of miRNAs into EVs for heterotrophic cell communication is altered by both, the presence of target transcripts and the self-presence of the respectively miRNA. In addition, the signature of miRNAs found in the exosomes significantly differed for those detected in the parent cells. To date, mechanisms controlling the specific loading of miRNAs into exosomes remain unclear. Indeed, several mechanisms may govern exosome sorting of specific subsets of miRNAs. MiRNA sorting appears to be influenced by different pathways and molecules in different cell types and tissues, and miRNAs contain well defined motifs (i.e., EXOmotifs), that direct the miRNA allocation into exosomes before delivery into recipient cells. A recent study showed that this RNA sequence can be recognized by the sumoylated form of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1). Moreover, a terminal 30 nucleotide addition in miRNAs affects their selective sorting in B cells. Another hypothesis suggests that RNAs are selectively sorted depending on the differential affinity of RNA motifs towards the raft-like region of the cytoplasmic surface of microvesicular body (MVB) limiting membranes. Current data indicate that cells can communicate with each other through the transfer of miRNA-loaded exosomes. For example, monocyte-derived exosomes deliver miR-150 to endothelial cells and enhance endothelial cell migration by reducing c-myb expression. The miRNA content of exosomes plays a critical role in such cell-to-cell communication and determines the fate of recipient cells. Thus, exosomes derived from the bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells of myeloma patients promote tumor growth depending on the content of miR-15a in exosomes.  Our group has described a novel cell-to-cell communication mechanism involving the delivery of endometrial miRNAs from the maternal endometrium to the trophectoderm cells of preimplantation embryos. Specifically, in B6C3 derived mouse embryos, we found EV-associated and free miR-30d to cause  overexpression of genes involved in embryonic adhesion processes, including Itb3, Itga7 and Cdh5. Furthermore, supplementing murine embryos with miR-30d significantly improved embryo adhesion, suggesting that external miRNAs may have a functional role as transcriptomic modifiers of preimplantation embryos. Based on profiling of miRNAs in endometrial fluid, maternally-derived miRNAs are present within EVs in the uterine microenvironment. The internalization of maternally-derived exosomes has been visualized, but the mechanism by which miR-30d becomes incorporated into exosomes remains unknown. The present study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of hsa-miR-30d transfer from human endometrial epithelial cells (hEECs) to the interior of exosomes and eventually to early-stage blastocysts, using a mir-30d knockout murine mode.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""endometrial gland""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]",,"implantation, crosstalk, miRNAs, extracellular vesicles","Protein Identification  The MS/MS information was sent to PARAGON algorithm via the sotware Protein Pilot v 4.5 (ABSciex).

In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins.

Although redox sites associated with antioxidative and metabolic functions are consistent, most of the H2O2-dependent redoxome varies dramatically between different cells. Structural analyses reveal that H2O2-sensitive cysteines are less conserved than their redox-insensitive counterparts and display distinct sequence motifs, structural features, and potential for crosstalk with lysine modifications.

The mzML files were searched against a decoy protein database consisting of forward and reversed human RefSeq version 54 database (Sep 25, 2012; 34,590 entries) using MS-GF+ (version 9979)(Kim and Pevzner, 2014). Precursor ion mass tolerance and fragmentation tolerance were both set as 10 ppm for the database search. The maximum number of modiﬁcations and missed cleavages allowed per peptide was three and two, respectively. Different modifications of + 15.9949 Da (methionine oxidation), + 57.0214 Da (iodoacetamide alkylation), +252.1222 (light and heavy IPM-triazohexanoic acid), and + 258.1424 (heavy IPM-triazohexanoic acid) were searched as variable modifications. Spectral identification mzID files generated from the MS-GF+ search were converted to idpXML files for protein assembly using IDPicker 3 (version 3.1.10199.0)(Holman et al., 2012). The maximum Q value of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) was set as 0.5% and each peptide should be identified by at least three spectra in CTRP experiments for each cell line. These stringent filters result in a final false-positive rate below 1% for peptides and their corresponding proteins groups. Peptide quantifications were performed with Skyline software as previously described(Schilling et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015a). Spectral libraries were imported from the mzID files. A subset FASTA database containing all the identifications (with and/or without IPM modification) exported from the IDPicker files was then imported into Skyline (version 3.1). The peptide list was refined in Skyline by removing all unmodified peptides. To further reduce the final false-positive rate of identification and enable reliable quantification of the remaining IPM-modified peptides in the list, all the automatically annotated spectra in the Skyline libraries were manually evaluated as previously described(Tabb et al., 2006). Moreover, the modified peptides whose matched spectra did not contain the major diagnostic fragment ions (m/z 311.12 and 317.14 for light and heavy peptides, respectively, which are generated by fragmentations analogous to those reported for cysteine conjugates(Levsen et al., 2005)) were excluded. After refining the peptide list, Raw files were directly imported into Skyline for automatic peak picking and MS1 filtering using the following criteria. First, the retention time of the PSM-identified peptide was used to position a retention time window (± 2.0 min) across the run lacking the same peptide identification. Second, the resolution for extracting the MS1 filtering chromatogram of the target precursor ions with both light and heavy labeled peptides was set to 60,000 at 400 Th. Following data extraction, graphical displays of chromatographic traces for the top three isotopic peaks were manually inspected for proper peak picking of MS1 filtered peptides and those with isotopic dot product scores lower than 0.8 were rejected. Several additional criteria were used to further ensure the high accuracy and precision of quantification: (1) signal to noise threshold of all the detected peptides was set to 3.0; (2) baseline separation was required between the isotopic peaks of a quantifiable peptide and unknown isobaric interference; (3) manual integration was applied if necessary. The ratios of peptide areas of light peptides to their heavy isotopes (RL:H) were calculated automatically.

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections.

Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins.

PXD009950,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009950,Gingipain transpeptidation -  Porphyromonas gingivalis Gingipains Display Transpeptidation Activity,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone periodontal pathogen that has been associated with autoimmune disorders. The cell surface proteases Lys-gingipain (Kgp) and Arg-gingipains (RgpA and RgpB) are major virulence factors and their proteolytic activity is enhanced by small peptides such as glycylglycine (GlyGly). The reaction kinetics suggested that GlyGly may function as an acceptor molecule for gingipain-catalysed transpeptidation. Purified gingipains and P. gingivalis whole cells were used to digest selected substrates including human haemoglobin in the presence or absence of peptide acceptors. Mass spectrometric analysis of the substrates digested with gingipains in the presence of GlyGly showed that transpeptidation outcompeted hydrolysis while the trypsin-digested controls exhibited predominantly hydrolysis activity. The transpeptidation levels increased with increasing concentration of GlyGly. Purified gingipains and whole cells exhibited extensive transpeptidation activities on human haemoglobin. All haemoglobin cleavage sites were found to be suitable for GlyGly transpeptidation and this transpeptidation enhanced haemoglobin digestion. The transpeptidation products were often more abundant than the corresponding hydrolysis products. In the absence of GlyGly, haemoglobin peptides produced during digestion were utilised as acceptors leading to the detection of up to 116 different transpeptidation products in a single reaction. P. gingivalis cells were able to digest haemoglobin faster when acceptor peptides derived from human serum albumin were included in the reaction suggesting that gingipain-catalysed transpeptidation may be relevant for substrates encountered in vivo.

The devised methods facilitate the qualitative assignment and prediction of hundreds of putative cellular assemblies in one experiment and without dependency on genetic engineering to introduce affinity tags. The present dataset consists of a native proteome extracted by mild lysis from the HEK293 cell line and fractionated into 80 fractions along high resolution size exclusion chromatography, and each fraction analyzed via bottom-up SWATH mass spectrometry. In multi-tiered targeted analysis, from this fragment ion level chromatographic data, quantitative complex assembly information of the proteome is reconstructed in three steps, (i) peptide-centric detection of peptide analytes within each SEC fraction based on fragment ion co-elution groups; (ii) protein-centric detection of protein elution in SEC based on fragment peptide co-elution groups in SEC; (iii) complex-centric detection and quantification of protein complexes and -variants based on component subunit protein co-elution groups in SEC.

Despite intense decades of research, the molecular details in many aspects of their function remain to be fully characterized. To unravel the details of how these viruses operate a thorough understanding of the relationships between the viral protein components is key. Here, we have created HVint, a novel protein-protein intra-viral interaction database for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which integrates data from five external sources. The coverage of the initial interactome was enlarged using evolutionary information, which integrates computational predictions for potential novel interactions in HSV-1. As an experimental validation for these predicted interactions, affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) was performed for the HSV-1 capsid protein, VP26. The VP26 interaction data provided experimental evidence supporting the interactions with pUL31 and pUL40, which were computationally predicted as direct partners. Other indirect interactions within the predicted network, such as pUL32 and pUL21, were also present in the AP-MS experiment. For access to the complete HVint network, we have developed a user-friendly and interactive web interface. Our approach demonstrates the power of computational predictions to assist in the design of targeted experiments for the discovery of novel protein-protein interactions.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Dehydrated"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]",,"[""Gel-based experiment""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","protein interactions, herpes simplex virus, virology, interactome, human, Orbitrap Velos","MS/MS fragmentation spectra were extracted and peptide spectrum matches were obtained using Proteome Discoverer (ver. 1.4)/SEQUEST (ver 1.3).

PXD009041,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009041,Functional proteomics of midostaurin in lung cancer cells: Phosphotyrosine Profiling,"Lung cancer is associated with high prevalence and mortality, and despite significant successes with targeted drugs in genomically defined subsets of lung cancer and immunotherapy, the majority of patients currently does not benefit from these therapies. Through a targeted drug screen, we found the recently approved multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin to have potent activity in several lung cancer cells independent of its intended target, PKC, or a specific genomic marker. To determine the underlying mechanism of action we applied a layered functional proteomics approach and a new data integration method. Using chemical proteomics, we identified multiple midostaurin kinase targets in these cells. Network-based integration of these targets with quantitative tyrosine and global phosphoproteomics data using protein-protein interactions from the STRING database and NetworKIN substrate prediction suggested multiple targets are relevant for the mode of action of midostaurin. Subsequent functional validation using RNA interference and selective small molecule probes showed that simultaneous inhibition of TBK1, PDK1 and AURKA was required to elicit midostaurin’s cellular effects. Immunoblot analysis of downstream signaling nodes showed that combined inhibition of these targets altered PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathways that in part converged on PLK1. Furthermore, rational combination of midostaurin with the more potent PLK1 inhibitor BI2536, which is in advanced clinical trials, elicited strong synergy. Our results demonstrate that combination of complementary functional proteomics approaches and subsequent network-based data integration can reveal novel insight into the complex mode of action of multi-kinase inhibitors, actionable targets for drug discovery and cancer vulnerabilities. Finally, we illustrate how this knowledge can be utilized for the rational design of synergistic drug combinations with high potential for clinical translation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TIC""]","Lung cancer, midostaurin, tyrosine phosphorylation","LC-MS/MS data were searched with MaxQuant 1.2.2.5 (pY) and 1.5.3.8 (pSTY)24 against the Human UniProt database (downloaded 12/2015, 20198 entries).

In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators. The present data suggest that successful pharmacological abrogation of the formation of lipid inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts may not suffice to suppress the release of several other powerful inflammatory mediators which we thus understand to be capable of establishing chronic inflammation states.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""skin""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human fibroblasts, chronic inflammation, shotgun proteomics, shotgun lipidomics, eicosadomics, metabolomics, multiple reaction monitoring","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

PXD001249,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001249,SNW1 is required for sister chromatid cohesion,"Although splicing is essential for the expression of most eukaryotic genes, inactivation of splicing factors causes specific defects in mitosis. The molecular cause of this defect is unknown. Here we show that the spliceosome subunits SNW1 and PRPF8 are essential for sister chromatid cohesion in human cells. A transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that SNW1 or PRPF8 depletion affects the splicing of specific introns in a subset of pre-mRNAs, including pre-mRNAs encoding the cohesion protein sororin and the APC/C subunit APC2. SNW1 depletion causes cohesion defects predominantly by reducing sororin levels, which causes destabilisation of cohesin on DNA. SNW1 depletion also reduces APC/C activity and contributes to cohesion defects indirectly by delaying mitosis and causing ‘cohesion fatigue’.

Unfortunately, efforts toward a high-resolution structure of full-length apoA-I have not been fruitful, though there have been successes with deletion mutants. Recently, a C-terminal truncation (apoA-IΔ185-243) was crystallized as a dimer. The structure showed two helical bundles connected by a long, curved pair of swapped helical domains. To compare this structure to that existing under solution conditions, we applied small angle X-ray scattering and isotope-assisted chemical cross-linking to apoA-IΔ185-243 in its dimeric and monomeric forms. For the dimer, we found evidence for the shared domains and aspects of the N-terminal bundles, but not the molecular curvature seen in the crystal. We also found that the N-terminal bundles equilibrate between open and closed states. Interestingly, this movement is one of the transitions proposed during lipid binding. The monomer was consistent with a model in which the long shared helix doubles back onto the helical bundle. Combined with the crystal structure, these data offer an important starting point to understand the molecular details of HDL biogenesis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biological""]","[""Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]",,"apolipoprotein,structural model, structural biology, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), mass spectrometry (MS), oligomerization","Mascot generic files were loaded into the SIM-XL search engine (18) for cross-linked peptides link version 1.1.

We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results.

To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the protein-protein interaction network for this PTP family, we isolated the ~ 70 PTP-associated protein complexes from HEK293T cells and provided a systematically proteomic analysis for this tumor suppressor family.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HEK-293T cell""]","[{""ptm"":""L-methionine sulfoxide"",""UNIMOD"":""35#M""},{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide - site C""},{""ptm"":""S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"",""UNIMOD"":""24#C""}]","[""LTQ Velos""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","Human, PTP, TAP-MS, HEK293T, LC-MSMS","Peptide sequences (and hence protein identity) were determined by matching protein databases with the acquired fragmentation pattern by the software program, SEQUEST (ver. 28).

These proteomic data showed correlation (r=0.7) with transcriptomic data from our previous studies. One-fourth of these proteins (51) had similar expression changes in colorectal cancer cells (vs. HCEC cells) and were therefore confidently attributed to the epithelial component of adenomas.

While numerical and/or structural centrosomes aberrations are implicated in cancer, mutations in centriolar and centrosomal proteins are genetically linked to ciliopathies, microcephaly and dwarfism. The evolutionarily conserved mechanisms underlying centrosome biogenesis are centered on a set of key proteins, including Plk4, Sas-6 and STIL, whose exact levels are critical to ensure accurate reproduction of centrioles during cell cycle progression. However, neither the intracellular levels of centrosomal proteins nor their stoichiometry within centrosomes are presently known. Here we have used two complementary approaches, targeted proteomics and EGFP-tagging of centrosomal proteins at endogenous loci, to measure protein abundance in cultured human cells and purified centrosomes.

As many archaeological sites before Mongolia's Iron Age suffer from a dearth of occupational materials, looking to biomolecular markers of dietary intake can open new investigational avenues into ancient economies. In this case, we use a previously established method of extracting proteins from calculus to explore the consumption of dairy products at LBA Khirigsuur sites in northern Mongolia's Hovsgol Aimag. Seven of nine individual's calculus contained peptides from the whey protein Beta-lactoglobulin from Ovis, Capra hircus, Bos, and general Bovidae species.  Aside from proteomics, these and 16 other individuals from the site were analysed for aDNA. We found that 18 of the 20 were primarily from one genetic ancestral group, and Ancient North Eurasian (ANE). One of the outliers represents a combination of ANE and Western Steppe Herder (WSH), with the other a combination of ANE and Eastern Asian (EE). This finding, while important in its own right, evidences the earliest known dairy consumption in Mongolia, and supports a widely held assumption that pastoralism was a primary subsistence strategy in the ancient Eastern Steppes.

Regarded as constitutively active kinases, their regulation in cells is critically important but poorly understood. We report here that members of the FAM83 family of uncharacterized proteins are central regulators of CK1 isoforms in cells. The eight members of the FAM83 family (A-H) interact and co-localize with different CK1 alpha, alpha-like, delta and epsilon isoforms. We demonstrate that the interaction with CK1 isoforms is mediated through a number of residues within a conserved domain of unknown function, termed DUF1669, which characterises the FAM83 family. CK1-binding deficient mutants of FAM83 proteins interfere with the subcellular localization of CK1 isoforms as well as FAM83 proteins themselves and their cellular functions.

EGFRvIII impacts both cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous aspects of GBM progression, including cell invasion, angiogenesis and modulation of the tumor microenvoiront, this is, at least in part, attributable to the release and intercellular trafficking of extracellular vesicles (EVs), heterogeneous membrane structures containing multiple bioactive macromolecules. Here we analyzed the impact of EGFRvIII on the profile of glioma EVs using a series of isogenic tumor cell lines, in which this oncogene exhibits a strong transforming activity. Thus, we observed that EGFRvIII expression alters several properties of glioma EVs, including their output and global protein composition. Using mass spectrometry, quantitative proteomic analysis and Gene Ontology terms filters, we observed that EVs released by EGFRVIII-transformed cells were enriched for extracellular exosome and focal adhesion related proteins. Among them, we validated the association of pro-invasive proteins (CD44, BSG, CD151) with EVs of EGFRvIII expressing cells, and down-regulation of exosomal markers (CD81 and CD82) in EVs of their indolent counterparts. Nano-flow cytometry revealed that the EV output from individual glioma cell lines was highly heterogeneous, such that only a fraction of EVs contained specific proteins such as EGFR, CD9, or others. Notably, cells expressing EGFRvIII released ample EVs double positive for CD44/BSG, and these proteins also co-localized in cellular filopodia. We also detected the expression of homophilic adhesion molecules and increased homologous EV uptake by EGFRvIII-positive glioma cells. These results suggest that oncogenic EGFRvIII reprograms the proteome of GBM-related EVs, a notion with considerable implications for their biological activity and properties relevant for development of EV-based cancer biomarkers.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""brain""]","[{""ptm"":""Carboxymethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""6""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TIC""]","EGFRvIII, oncogene, extracellular vesicles, exosomes, invasion, heterogeneity, glioblastoma, glioma, cancer, nano-flow cytometry","All experiments were carried out in three biological replications.

Shotgun proteomics data were processed using PEAKS Studio software (version 8.0)32, and peak lists were searched against the UniProtKB homo sapiens ‘UP000005640’ reference proteome (canonical; 70956 entries; downloaded on December 15, 2016) with trypsin selected as proteinase (≤ 3 missed cleavages), cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification, methionine oxidation as variable oxidation, and allowing ≤ 6 modifications per peptide, ≤ 10.0 ppm precursor mass deviation (using monoisotopic mass), ≤ 0.2 Da fragment ion deviation, and ≤ 1.0% false discovery rates (FDR) for peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), proteins and peptides for the principal analyses. For evaluation of cysteine carbamidomethylation efficiency, this modification was set to variable; for assessment of protocol-induced asparagine and glutamine deamidation, the corresponding modification was added as variable modification; and any further modification assessment was based on PEAKS PTM (including all 485 built-in modifications) and SPIDER searches on spectra with de novo ALC (Average Local Confidence) scores greater than 15%. Label-free quantification using ion counts was performed on the basis of the results of the principal PEAKS search, as described above, followed by further filtering and processing of the data using an in-house developed script in R (version 3.4.0) and R Studio (version 1.0.143). With respect to peptide quantification, peptide areas were summed for peptides with corresponding primary amino acid sequence thus including all PTMs and charge states. For protein quantification, areas of peptides belonging to the same protein group were summed, yet only if they were unique for the corresponding protein group. For both peptide and protein quantification, DDA data was scaled by median scale normalization. Bioinformatics analysis. Data analysis was performed using R, R studio, Microsoft Excel, and GraphPad Prism (version 5.00). For assessment of (relative) recovery and precision, peptides and proteins that were measured in all 20 samples originating from the same tissue (four sample preparation approaches, five replicates per approach) were included, and average levels as well as coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for every approach, of which the latter values were used for evaluating the precision of the sample preparation method. For every peptide/protein, the highest average quantity was set to 100% and the other three average quantities were related to this maximum value thereby obtaining relative peptide/protein levels which were used for evaluation of the recovery of the sample preparation approaches. Assessment of the discovery potential for each of the sample preparation methods was based on comparing the amounts of proteins and peptides identified (in three out of five, four out of five, and five out of five replicates) per method as well as based on comparisons of the trypsin cleavage efficiencies, the fractions of cysteine-containing peptides (relative to the total number of peptides), methionine oxidized peptides (relative to the total number of methionine containing peptides), and asparagine and/or glutamine deamidated peptides (relative to the total number of asparagine and/or glutamine containing peptides) for each method.

Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections.

PXD001449,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001449,Validation of alternatively spliced protein isoforms in human mesenchymal stem cells,"Alternative splicing of mRNA diversifies the function of human proteins, with tissue- and cell-specific protein isoforms being the most difficult to validate. While transcriptomic experiments enable the detection of many alternatively spliced transcripts, it is not known if these transcripts have protein-coding potential. We recently published the PG Nexus pipeline, which facilitates high confidence validation of exons and exon-exon junctions of spliced transcripts by integrating transcriptomics and proteomics data. Using the PG Nexus, we analyzed undifferentiated human mesenchymal stem cells and compared the number of protein isoforms validated using different protein sequence database, including public online databases and RNA-seq derived databases. With significant overlaps with other databases, we identified 8,011 exons and 3,824 splice junctions with the Ensembl database. Both exonic and junction peptides were important for protein isoform validation. The Ensembl database consistently outperformed the other data sources, but predicted open reading frames from RNA-seq derived transcripts were comparable, with only 6 less splice junctions validated. Using proteotypic and isoform-specific peptides, we validated 462 protein isoforms. This number increases to 1,083 if multiple proteotypic peptides per protein are included. Multiplexing proteotypic peptides in SRM assays or similar experiments will increase the confidence and coverage of protein isoform validation experiments.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""bone marrow""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, mesenchymal stem cell, LC-MS/MS","Proteolytic peptide samples were separated by nano-LC using an UltiMate 3000 HPLC and autosampler system (Dionex, Amsterdam, Netherlands), and ionized using positive ion mode electrospray following experimental procedures described previously [37].

The cancer sectretome, the collection of all macromolecules secreted by a tumor cell, alters its composition compared to normal tissue, and this change plays an important role in the observation of cancer progression. The collection and accurate analysis of cancer secretomes could lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers, thus improving outcomes of cancer treatment. We unexpectedly discovered that enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) of a D-peptide hydrogelator results in nanonets/hydrogel around cancer cells that overexpress ectophosphatases. Here we show that these nanonets are able to rapidly collect proteins in the pericellular space (i.e., near the surface) of cancer cells. Because the secretory substances are at their highest concentration near the cell surface, the use of pericellular nanonets to collect the cancer secretome maximizes the yield and quality of samples, reduces pre-analytical variations, and allows the dynamic profiling of secretome samples. Thus, this new approach has great potential in identifying the heterotypic signaling in tumor microenvironments thereby improving the understanding of tumor microenvironments and accelerating the discovery of potential biomarkers in cancer biology.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lung"",""lung cancer cell line""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide - site C""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]","[""Peptide counting""]","Human, Secretome, Cancer","All proteins and peptides were identified by SEQUEST (the database search algorithm, http://thompson.mbt.washington.edu/sequest) from the mass spec results and predicted fragmentation pattern of the peptide.

Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method.

While the transcriptional network of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has been extensively studied, relatively little is known about how post-transcriptional modulations determine hESC function. RNA-binding proteins play central roles in RNA regulation, including translation and turnover. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 is highly expressed in hESCs to maintain their undifferentiated state and prevent default neural fate. Notably, loss of CSDE1 accelerates neural differentiation and potentiates neurogenesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of CSDE1 impairs neural differentiation. We find that CSDE1 post-transcriptionally modulates core components of multiple regulatory nodes of hESC identity, neuroectoderm commitment and neurogenesis. Among these key pro-neural/neuronal factors, CSDE1 binds fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) and vimentin (VIM) mRNAs as well as transcripts involved in neuron projection development regulating their stability and translation.

As a result, complete and accurate characterization of human bone proteome is yet to be performed, and as a result, several bone-related diseases such as craniosynostosis and osteosarcoma are still poorly understood. We sought to develop a reproducible method for extracting whole proteins of varying molecular weights from human cranial bone. Whole protein was extracted from human cranial suture by mechanically processing samples using a method that minimized heat introduction to proteins to limit degradation. Western blotting suggests the presence of whole protein while mass spectrometry was used to sequence peptides and identify isolated proteins. Molecular weights of extracted protein ranged from 9.4-629 kDa and contained proteins of both intra- and extra-cellular origin. High correlation scores among suture protein spectral counts suggest the reproducibility of the method.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation. The search result files were loaded into Pinnacle version 1.0.26.0, and the spectral library threshold settings included a Percolator q-value less than 0.05, XCorr scores above 1.5/2.0/2.2 for singly/doubly/triply charged peptides, and a Mascot Ion score > 29. Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).",2017-01-17,"[[""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201600300"",""PMID:28195392""]]"

At the discovery stage we used a “pooling” strategy for the comparative analysis of immunodepleted serum from patients with early-(CES) and late-stage (CLS) cervical cancer versus healthy controls that revealed 15 up- and 26 down-regulated proteins. The analysis of a new of non-depleted serum samples from patients with CIN, CES, CLS, and healthy controls showed significant changes in abundance of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1, alpha-1-antitrypsin, serotransferrin, haptoglobin, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein and vitamin D-binding protein. To further validate our findings we developed a fast UPLC/MRM method for the simultaneous targeted quantification of these proteins in a new set of 48 CIN, 50 CES, 34 CLS and 48 healthy controls as well as 49 serum samples from patients with ovarian cancer.

In spite of the oncogenic function of mutant BRAF, these lesions are arrested by a cell-autonomous mechanism called Oncogene-Induced Senescence (OIS). Infrequently, nevi can progress to malignant melanoma, through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. To gain more insight into this vital tumor suppression mechanism, we performed a mass spectrometry-based screening of the proteome and phosphoproteome in cycling and senescent cells as well as cells that have abrogated senescence. Proteome analysis of senescent cells revealed the upregulation of established senescence biomarkers, including specific cytokines, but also several proteins not previously associated with senescence, including extracellular matrix-interacting. Using both general and targeted phosphopeptide enrichment by Ti4+-IMAC and phosphotyrosine antibody enrichment, we identified over 15,000 phosphorylation sites. Among the regulated phosphorylation sites we encountered components of the interleukin, BRAF/MAPK and CDK-retinoblastoma (Rb) pathways and several other factors. The extensive proteome and phosphoproteome dataset of BRAFV600E-expressing senescent cells provides molecular clues as to how OIS is initiated, maintained or evaded, serving as a comprehensive proteomic basis for functional validation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""formylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""122""},{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""dihydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""425""},{""ptm"":""2x(13)C,6x(2)H labeled dimethylated L-arginine"",""UNIMOD"":""330""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""PRIME-XS Project"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"oncogene-induced senescence, proteome, phosphoproteome, cancer",Data was processed using Proteome discoverer 1.3 and filtered to 1%FDR.,2014-06-17,"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.M113.035436"",""PMID:24961811""]]"
PXD002591,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD002591,A novel quantitative mass spectrometry platform for determining site-specific protein O-GlcNAcylation dynamics,"Over the past decades, protein O-GlcNAcylation has been found to play a fundamental role in cell cycle control, metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and cellular signaling. Nevertheless, quantitative approaches to determine in vivo GlcNAc dynamics at a large-scale are still not readily available. Here, we have developed an approach to isotopically label O-GlcNAc modifications on proteins by producing 13C-labeled UDP-GlcNAc from 13C6-glucose via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. This metabolic labeling was combined with quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to determine site-specific protein O-GlcNAcylation turnover rates. First, an efficient enrichment method for O-GlcNAc peptides was developed with the use of phenylboronic acid solid-phase extraction and anhydrous DMSO. The near stoichiometry reaction between the diol of GlcNAc and boronic acid dramatically improved the enrichment efficiency. Additionally, our kinetic model for turnover rates integrates both metabolomic and proteomic data, which increase the accuracy of the turnover rate estimation. Other advantages of this metabolic labeling method include in vivo application, direct labeling of the O-GlcNAc sites and higher confidence for site identification. Concentrating only on nuclear localized GlcNAc modified proteins, we are able to identify 159 O-GlcNAc sites on 74 proteins and determine turnover rates of 24 O-GlcNAc peptides from 21 proteins extracted from HeLa nuclei. In general, we found O-GlcNAcylation turnover rates are slower than those published for phosphorylation or acetylation. Nevertheless, the rates widely varied depending on both the protein and the residue modified. We believe this methodology can be broadly applied to reveal turnovers/dynamics of protein O-GlcNAcylation from different biological states and will provide more information on the significance of site-specific O-GlcNAcylation, enabling us to study the temporal dynamics of this critical modification in a site-specific manner for the first time.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""N-acetylaminoglucosylated"",""UNIMOD"":""425#M""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Technical"",""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,mass spectrometry method determines protein O-GlcNAcylation rates,"RAW files were converted to MS1 and MS2 files by xtract 1.0.0.8 in pFind Studio 2.8 (pfind.ict.ac.cn) and converted to MGF files by pParse to calibrate the precursor isotopic mass to the monoisotopic mass and export co-eluted precursors, which could increase the identification rate.(41) The MS1 and MS2 files were used for quantification and the MGF files were used for database searching and site localization.

PXD008554,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008554,Quantitative secretomics during cardiomyogenic differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells,"Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of life-threatening burden around the world. The heart has a very low regeneration capacity and donor organs for transplantation are scarce. Therefore regeneration of lost myocardium with stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) provides an attractive strategy for heart repair. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be efficiently differentiated in vitro into CMs but the molecular mechanisms behind this process are still not fully understood. In particular identification of secreted autocrine and/or paracrine factors that function as important extrinsic signals remained elusive because the mass spectrometry (MS)-based identification of secreted proteins from cell culture supernatants is impeded by high levels of albumin present in common differentiation media. Thus we established an albumin-free cardiomyogenic differentiation medium and performed secretomics at seven different time points during in vitro differentiation. This analysis led to the identification of 4832 proteins with 1802 being significantly altered during differentiation and 431 of these were annotated as secreted according to gene ontology. Bioinformatics revealed enrichment of extrinsic Wnt pathway-related proteins 3 days upon induction of differentiation and of extracellular matrix proteins in the resulting CMs. Numerous extrinsic components of Wnt, Activin A, Nodal, TGFβ, BMP or FGF signaling pathways were quantitatively assessed during differentiation. Notably, the abundance of pathway agonists was generally lower compared to the respective antagonists but their curves of progression over timer were rather similar. We hypothesize that Activin A, Nodal and TGFβ signaling are turned down shortly upon initiation of cardiac differentiation whereas BMP signaling is switched on. Wnt and FGF signaling peaks between d0 and d3 of differentiation and interestingly, Activin A and TGFβ signaling seem to be reactivated at the cardiac progenitor stages and/or in early CMs.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""deaminated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Secretomics, LC-MS/MS, hiPSCs, hESCs, Cardiomyogenesis","LC-MS/MS Analysis Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS as decribed by Konze et al., 2014, Konze et al., 2017a and Konze et al., 2017b.

However, challenges to achieve similar response in patients harboring solid tumour are still considerable. To achieve anti-tumor efficacy, these cells must survive, expand and persist after infusion into patients. An important lesson has been derived from clinical trials using CAR technologies: the relevance of the CAR design to enhance signaling and sustain T cell proliferation and survival.  Here, we prove that third generation CARs specific for GD2 antigen incorporating CD28.4-1BB costimulatory domains improves T cell immunotherapy in a neuroblastoma (NB) pre-clinical model, as compared to a CAR with the same specificity but including CD28.OX40 costimulation. Indeed, we test the anti-tumor activity of polyclonal T cells genetically modified with third generation CAR.GD2 incorporating either CD28.4-1BB or CD28.OX40 in frame with the safety switch inducible Caspase 9 (iC9). We prove a significant in vitro and in vivo amelioration of the approach by the presence of 4.1BB signaling in terms of: 1) less T cell exhaustion, 2) lower basal T cell activation, 3) higher in vivo tumor control and 4) T cell persistence. In addition, the fine tuning of T cell culture conditions with the use of IL7 and IL15 show to be synergic with the third generation CAR.GD2 design to optimize CAR T immunotherapy for NB.

We compared the cervicovaginal proteome as characterised by mass-spectrometry of four groups of African female sex workers (total N=50) grouped by microbiome composition as characterised by 16S rDNA microarray.  Group 1 had a Lactobacillus crispatus-dominated microbiome, group 2 a L. iners-dominated microbiome, and groups 3 and 4 had a microbiome containing multiple genera of anaerobic bacteria, with group 3 representing transition to or from dysbiosis and group 4 full dysbiosis. 82 human proteins were differentially abundant among the groups, either showing an increasing or decreasing trend from microbiome groups 1 to 4. Proteins that increased included proteasome subunits and other proteins involved in catabolic metabolism, actin organising proteins and proteins involved in the immune response. Proteins that decreased included antiproteases, keratins, and cornified envelope proteins. We also compared the abundance of pre-defined proteins of interest among microbiome groups: markers of cell type, inflammation, and cell death, and mucins. The dysbiotic groups had increased abundance of proteins unique to lymphocytes and macrophages, pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell death markers, and MUC5B. We conclude that the cervicovaginal human proteome is associated with the cervicovaginal microbiome in a dose-response manner. The changes are likely caused by a pro-inflammatory influx of immune cells and an increase of cell death in dysbiosis. Dysbiosis-associated immune activation, breaches in epithelial integrity, altered mucin balance, and altered protease-antiprotease balance may all contribute to the increased risk of HIV transmission when cervicovaginal dysbiosis is present.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cervicovaginal fluid""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]",bacterial vaginosis/ cervicovaginal microbiome/ cervicovaginal proteome/ HIV/ Lactobacillus crispatus/ mass spectrometry,"Thermo RAW files were imported into Progenesis LC–MS (version 4.1, Nonlinear Dynamics).

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Adverse drug effects, cell biology, drug effects, inflammatory response, mass spectrometry, PBMCs, proteomics, secretome","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

PXD001174,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001174,Un-conditioned commercial embryo culture media contain a large variety of non-declared proteins: a comprehensive proteomics analysis,"Study question: Which non-declared proteins (proteins not listed on the composition list of the product data sheet) are present in unconditioned commercial embryo culture media?  Summary answer: A total of 110 non-declared proteins were identified in unconditioned media and between 6 and 8 of these were quantifiable.   What is known already: There are no data in the literature on what non-declared proteins are present in un-conditioned (fresh media in which no embryos have been cultured) commercial embryo media.  Study design, size, duration: The following eight commercial embryo culture media were included in this study: G-1 PLUS and G-2 PLUS G5 Series from Vitrolife, Sydney IVF Cleavage Medium and Sydney IVF Blastocyst Medium from Cook Medical and EmbryoAssist, BlastAssist, Sequential Cleav and Sequential Blast from ORIGIO. Two batches were analysed for each of the Sydney IVF media and one batch from each of the other media. All embryo culture media are supplemented by the manufacturers with purified human serum albumin (HSA 5 mg/ml). The purified HSA (HSA-solution from Vitrolife) and the recombinant human albumin supplement (G-MM from Vitrolife) were also analysed.   Participants/materials, setting, methods: For protein quantification, media samples were in-solution digested with trypsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For in-depth protein identification, media were albumin depleted, dialyzed and concentrated before sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was cut into 14 slices followed by in-gel trypsin digestion, and analysis by LC-MS/MS. Proteins were further investigated using gene ontology (GO) terms analysis.  Main results and the role of chance: Using advanced mass spectrometry and high confidence criteria for accepting proteins (p< 0.01), a total of 110 proteins other than HSA were identified. The average serum albumin content was found to be 94% (92% - 97%) of total protein. Other individual proteins accounted for up to 4.7% of the total protein. Analysis of purified HSA strongly suggests that these non-declared proteins are introduced to the media when the albumin is added. GO analysis showed that many of these proteins have roles in defence pathways, for example 18 were associated with the innate immune response and 17 with inflammatory responses. Eight proteins have been reported previously as secreted embryo proteins.  Limitations, reasons for caution: For six of the commercial embryo culture media only one batch was analyzed. However, this does not affect the overall conclusions.  Wider implications of the findings: The results showed that the HSA added to IVF media contained many other proteins and that the amount varies from batch to batch. These variations in protein profiles are problematic when attempting to identify proteins derived from the embryos. Therefore, when studying the embryo secretome and analysing conditioned media with the aim of finding potential biomarkers that can distinguish normal and abnormal embryo development, it is important that the medium used in the experimental and control groups is from the same batch. Furthermore, the proteins present in un-conditioned media could potentially influence embryonic development, gestation age, birthweight and perhaps have subsequent effects on health of the offspring.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"",""UNIMOD"":""24#C""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"IVF, culture media, embryo, secretome, proteomics, LC-MS/MS","Protein Identification The collected MS files were converted to Mascot generic format (MGF) using the AB SCIEX MS Data Converter beta 1.3 (AB SCIEX) and the ""proteinpilot MGF"" parameters.

In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators.

In the majority of cases, patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage or even metastatic, thus explaining the high mortality. The standard protocol for treating patients with locally advanced non-metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (NRCT) with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), but the resistance rate to this treatment remains high with approximately 30% of non-responders. The lack of evidence available in clinical practice to predict NRCT resistance to 5-FU and to guide clinical practice therefore encourages the search for biomarkers of this resistance. Methods: From twenty-three formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies performed before NRCT with 5-FU of locally advanced non-metastatic CRC patients, we extracted and analysed the tumor proteome of these patients. From clinical data, we were able to classify the twenty-two patients in our cohort into three treatment response groups: non-responders (NR), partial responders (PR) and total responders (TR), and to compare the proteomes of these different groups.  Results: We have highlighted 384 differentially expressed proteins between NR and PR, 248 between NR and TR and 417 between PR and TR. Among these proteins, we have identified many differentially expressed proteins identified as having a role in cancer (IFIT1, FASTKD2, PIP4K2B, ARID1B, SLC25A33: overexpressed in TR; CALD1, CPA3, B3GALT5, CD177, RIPK1: overexpressed in NR). We have also identified that DPYD, the main degradation enzyme of 5-FU, was overexpressed in NR, as well as several ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins also overexpressed in NR.  Conclusions: From these retrospective study, we implemented a protein extraction protocol from FFPE biopsy to highlight protein differences between different response groups to RCTN with 5-FU in patients with locally advanced non-metastatic CRC. These results will pave the way for a larger cohort for better sensitivity and specificity of the signature to guide decisions in the choice of treatment.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""colon""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]","[""APEX - Absolute Protein Expression""]","colorectal cancer, resistance to neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy, 5-fluorouracil, proteomics, mass spectrometry, predictive biomarkers","Quantification and bioinformatics analysis.

Using optimal control theory to constrain reaction-diffusion schemes that are dependent on different surface-to-volume relationships, we find that information from cell shape can be resolved from mechanical signals. We used microfabricated 3-D biomimetic chips to validate predictions that shape-sensing occurs in a tension-independent manner through β3 integrin signaling pathway in human kidney podocytes and smooth muscle cells. Differential proteomics and functional ablation assays indicate that β3 integrin is critical in transduction of shape signals through ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family. We used experimentally determined diffusion coefficients and experimentally validated simulations to show that shape sensing is an emergent cellular property enabled by multiple molecular characteristics of β3 integrin.

Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators. The present data suggest that successful pharmacological abrogation of the formation of lipid inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts may not suffice to suppress the release of several other powerful inflammatory mediators which we thus understand to be capable of establishing chronic inflammation states.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""skin""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human fibroblasts, chronic inflammation, shotgun proteomics, shotgun lipidomics, eicosadomics, metabolomics, multiple reaction monitoring","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

PXD005477,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD005477,Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Specialized Wiring of Signaling Pathways that Protects Human Regulatory T Cell Identity - 5 populations ex vivo,"Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) are functionally distinct from conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs). To understand Treg identity, we compared by proteomics and transcriptomics human naïve (n) and effector (e)Tregs, Tconvs and transitional FOXP3+ cells. Only 12% of 422 differentially expressed proteins was identified as such at the mRNA level, demonstrating the importance of direct proteome measurement. Fifty-one proteins discriminated Tregs from Tconvs. This common Treg protein signature indicates altered signaling by TCR-, TNF receptor-, NFB-, PI3 kinase/mTOR-, NFAT- and STAT pathways, and unique cell biological and metabolic features. Another protein signature uniquely identified eTregs and revealed active cell division, apoptosis sensitivity and suppression of NFB- and STAT signaling. eTreg fate appears consolidated by FOXP3 outnumbering its partner transcription factors. These features explain why eTregs cannot produce inflammatory cytokines, whereas transitional FOXP3+ cells can. Collectively, our data reveal that Treg identity is defined and protected by uniquely “wired” signaling pathways.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion ETD""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","Human, CD4+ T cells, LFQ","Data Processing and Analysis  RAW mass spectrometry files were processed with the MaxQuant computational platform (Cox and Mann, 2008) version 1.5.2.8 using label-free quantitation (LFQ). Peptides were identified using the Andromeda search engine by querying the human Uniprot database (2015-02, 89796 entries) with a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off both at peptide and protein level. Potential contaminants and reverse hits were eliminated using Perseus version 1.5.0.31. To compare proteomes of different cell populations, LFQ values were log2-transformed and the 3 technical replicates per experimental condition grouped. For further analysis, only proteins with 3 valid values in at least one of the groups were included. Missing values were imputed by normal distribution (width= 0.3, shift= 1.8). Intergroup differences in protein levels were calculated using ANOVA using Benjamini Hochberg FDR of 0.05 and S0 0. General relatedness of samples was assessed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Perseus’ built-in tool. Calculation of Pearson’s correlations was assessed using Gitools (version 2.2.3)(Perez-Llamas and Lopez-Bigas, 2011). Clusters of proteins with specific expression patterns were identified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on K-means and Euclidian distance after z-score normalization. Cell type specific clusters were further analyzed for enrichment of functional and biological categories, using STRING and DAVID bioinformatics tools. Pathway diagrams were generated through the use of Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®, QIAGEN). GO biological processes redundancy was removed using REVIGO (Supek et al., 2011).  Absolute protein abundance was estimated using the proteomic ruler approach using a plug-in built in Perseus as described by the authors (Wiśniewski et al., 2014). The abundances were expressed as protein copy numbers and the values were log10 transformed and presented in graphs using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).  Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the geneset collection C3 from the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB v4.0) that contains information about curated-, motif-, transcription factor targets gene sets. The genes that share a transcription factor binding site are defined and annotated by TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2006) (version 7.4).   Protein and RNA comparison The comparison of protein and transcript abundances across cell types was performed as published before (Wilhelm et al., 2014). Briefly, absolute transcript abundances (expressed as fragment per kilobase per million, FPKM) were extracted from the RNA-Seq data. Absolute protein abundance was estimated using the intensity based absolute protein quantification (iBAQ)(Schwanhäusser et al., 2011) approach with few modifications described elsewhere (Wilhelm et al., 2014). Briefly, peptide intensities were summed up and divided by the number of observable peptides per protein. The iBAQ values were then normalized based on the total sum of all protein intensities in order to be able to compare abundances across samples. Proteins were mapped to transcripts using the Uniprot.ws package (Bioconductor) resulting in 4,782 transcripts/proteins with expression data. For the comparison of protein and mRNA abundances, protein and transcript expression of 409 differentially expressed proteins/RNAs was z-score-transformed. All the analyses were performed using R (v 3.2.0).",2017-09-15,"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.immuni.2018.04.008"",""PMID:29752063""]]"

In this method, an mRP-C18 column was used to fractionate the proteins from a whole cell lysate of a breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, into 38 fractions. Each fraction was subjected to tryptic digestion, sequential phosphopeptide enrichment by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), followed by capillary RPLC-MS/MS analysis. For comparison, the conventional method of using strong cation exchange (SCX)-RPLC separation of peptides combined with MS/MS was also used for analyzing the phosphoproteome. Replicate experiments by the mRP-RPLC method identified 1585 distinct phosphoproteins with 4519 phosphopeptides, compared to 1585 phosphoproteins with 4297 phosphopeptides by SCX-RPLC, with a total of 1947 phosphoproteins and 6278 phosphopeptides identified from the combined results. While the two methods have similar ability in the identification of the phosphoproteome, they produce complementary information. The phosphoproteins identified in this study, including 67 novel phosphorylation sites from 56 breast cancer related proteins, can serve as the entry point for future validation with biological implications in breast cancer.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Waters instrument model""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"mass spectrometry, MDA-MB-231, mRP-RPLC, phosphoproteome, SCX-RPLC","Raw MS/MS data were lock-mass-corrected, de-isotoped, and converted to peak list files by ProteinLynx Global Server 2.3 (Waters, Milford, MA).

One of the hallmarks of AIDP pathogenesis is a significantly elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level in comparison with the peptidome/proteome profile of a representative number of CSF samples obtained from AIDP and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and control patients. In total, 2355 peptide fragments related to 795 proteins were found in CSF samples from AIDP patients, 1066 peptide fragments of 253 proteins in samples from MS patients, and 774 peptide fragments of 220 proteins from control patients. Proteomic studies detected 1103 proteins in the control cohort and 1402 proteins in the AIDP cohort. Our dataset suggests that the proteome of the CSF from AIDP and control patients overlaps by as much as 67%, whereas the peptidome is only 21.5% identical. Comparison of the peptidomic and proteomic data revealed that 80% of the peptides in the CSF of AIDP patients correspond to proteins that are not present in proteomic dataset. Importantly, a considerable number of differentially represented peptides are related to the proteins involved in the arrangement of the axonal domains. The observed peptidomic dataset indicates that specific proteins, which participate in the arrangement of the myelin sheath in the nodes of Ranvier, are degraded in the course of AIDP.  Here, we show that the proteins that are overrepresented in the CSF of AIDP patients are partially linked with defensive responses to bacteria and viruses. These observations are in line with the upregulation of CSF cytokines associated with innate immunity, which in turn surprisingly suggests that the destruction of axons is not accompanied by any indications of a distinct adaptive autoimmune process. We believe that the presented proteomic and peptidomic dataset of the CSF from AIDP patients will provide useful information regarding the mechanisms of AIDP pathogenesis in comparison with MS, which is the prolonged but incurable autoimmune degradation of the central nervous system.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cerebrospinal fluid""]","[{""ptm"":""Carboxymethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""6""},{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Dehydrated"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]",,"Guillain-Barre syndrome, AIDP, cerebrospinal fluid, immunoglobulins","LC-MS/MS data analyses The peak lists from the MS/MS data were generated and recalibrated using ProteinPilot (version 4.5; ABSciex).

Moderated t-test with a paired design was used to compare the log2 transformed iBAQ values between S1 and S3, S1 and S2, and S2 and S3 using limma package. To adjust for multiple comparisons, p values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method.

The potential benefits of tissue-specific scaffolds consisting of naturally-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) have been demonstrated using a wide variety of animal and human tissue sources. However, so far, testis scaffolds have never been considered for constructive remodelling purposes. We have therefore developed a protocol for the preparation of cell-free extracellular matrix and characterized the material extensively using a combination of proteomics, immunohistochemsitry, and cell population assays. To prepare cell-free matrix, human cadaveric testicular tissue was exposed for 24 h or 48 h to 1% Triton X-100 and/or 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The extent of decellularization was evaluated by histology. Confirmation of cell removal in DTM was done by a DNA quantification technique. The protein composition was analysed by LC-MS/MS. The retention of testicular tissue-specific characteristics was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, Alcian blue staining and scanning electron microscopy. Soluble toxicity and testicular cell attachment was assessed to check the cytocompatibility of DTM scaffolds.  Histological analysis showed that DTM could be obtained by mechanical agitation in 1% SDS for 24 h. The resulting DTM was found to be clear of cells while retaining the typical three-dimensional structure. Proteomics analysis revelaed the presence of  the major components of the native tissue scaffold, including collagen type I and IV, fibronectin, laminin and glycosaminoglycans. In addition, numerous additional ECM proteins in DTM were detected, indicating its complex nature. Importantly, we demonstrated that DTM scaffolds are not cytotoxic, as evidenced by MTT assay showing a normal fibroblast proliferation activity after indirect exposure, and support testicular cell attachment and infiltration.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""testis""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Extracellular matrix, 3D cell culture, testicular structure","Tandem mass spectra were extracted using Raw2MGF (in-house developed software), and the resulting mascot generic files were searched against the concatenated human SwissProt protein database (vs. 2014_01) using the Mascot 2.3.0 (Matrix Science Ltd).

In this study we investigate the function of syntaxin-3 in VWF secretion. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from healthy controls endogenous syntaxin-3 immunolocalized to WPBs. A detailed analysis of BOECs isolated from a patient with variant microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), carrying a homozygous mutation in STX3 (STX3-/-), showed a loss of syntaxin-3 protein and absence of WPB-associated syntaxin-3 immunoreactivity. Ultrastructural analysis revealed no detectable differences in morphology or prevalence of immature or mature WPBs in control versus STX3-/- BOECs. VWF multimer analysis showed normal patterns in plasma of the MVID patient, and media from STX3-/- BOECs, together indicating WPB formation and maturation are unaffected by absence of syntaxin-3. However, a clear defect in Ca2+ and cAMP-mediated VWF secretion was found in the STX3-/- BOECs. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that syntaxin-3 associates with the WPB SNAREs SNAP23 and VAMP8. Our data reveal syntaxin-3 as a novel WPB-associated SNARE controlling VWF secretion and highlight the complex regulation of WPB exocytosis by multiple SNARE complexes.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion ETD""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","endothelial cells, syntaxin-3, SNARE machinery, Von Willebrand factor, Weibel-Palade body, proteomics","Tryptic peptides were separated by nanoscale C18 reverse chromatography coupled online to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) via a nanoelectrospray ion source (Nanospray Flex Ion Source, Thermo Scientific), using the same settings as described in 3.

CCC is a primary cancer which arises from the epithelial cells of the bile ducts and is characterised by high mortality rates due to its late clinical presentation and limited treatment options. Tumorous tissue and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue from eight CCC patients were analysed by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and by mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics. After data analysis and statistical evaluation of the proteins which were found to be differentially regulated between the two experimental groups (fold change ≥ 1.5; p-value ≤ 0.05), 15 candidate proteins were chosen for verification by immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of 14 patients. This confirmed the significant up-regulation of chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC1), gelsolin (GSN), pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (PKM2), serpin H1, 14-3-3 protein sigma (SFN), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) and tax1-binding protein 3 (Tax1BP3) in tumorous cholangiocytes when compared to normal hepatocytes, whereas fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1) and Betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1 (BHMT) were significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, STIP1 and SFN were able to differentiate between CCC tumour cells and non-tumorous cholangiocytes with a sensitivity of 100% and 86%, respectively and a specificity of 100% in both cases. We therefore conclude that these proteins should be considered as potential diagnostic biomarkers for CCC in an immunohistochemical application. Additional experiments addressing the validation of these novel biomarker candidates are being performed.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cholangioma cell"",""liver""]","[{""ptm"":""oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"",""UNIMOD"":""24#C""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap"",""instrument model""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Bottom-up proteomics""]",,"Human, Liver, Cholangiocellular Carcinoma, MALDI, LC-MS",Not available,2013-10-20,"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:25034945""]]"

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""breast""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts, comparative proteome profiling, label-free quantification, primary human cells, tissue proteomics.","Protein identification was carried out using ProteomeDiscoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) by searching against the SwissProt Database (version December 2012 with 20,209 protein entries) supplemented with common contaminant proteins.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Adverse drug effects, cell biology, drug effects, inflammatory response, mass spectrometry, PBMCs, proteomics, secretome","ProteomeDiscoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

Biomarkers that predict disease outcome at the time of initial diagnosis would aid management of the disease.  Experimental design: Proteins extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embeddded sections were identified either using LC-MALDI MS/MS of tryptic digests or after separation by one- or two-dimensional electrophoresis. A list of potential biomarker candidates, based on proposed associations with prostate cancer, was derived from the 320 identified proteins.  Results: Four of the candidates: annexin A2, peroxiredoxin-1, prostate-specific antigen and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, were examined by Western blotting of extracts of biopsies from men whom there was 10-year disease outcome data. Multiplexed Western blotting using cocktails of antibodies and fluor-labeled detection reagents showed that annexin A2 provided the best prediction of risk of metastatic disease.  Conclusions and clinical relevance:  This pilot study indicates that tumour expression of ANXA2 in diagnostic biopsies of a prostate cancer is predictive for the metastatic potential of that cancer. The potential of protein profiling of each cancer is to lead to an overall reduction in mortality from metastatic prostate cancer as well as reduced treatment associated morbidity.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""prostate gland""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""4800 Proteomics Analyzer""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,FFPE / Prognostic biomarkers / Prostate cancer / Proteomics,"Gel-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS spectra were collected using an ABSCIEX 5800 MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer in positive ion mode.

PXD000930,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000930,Naa30 is critically involved in maintaining mitochondrial and Golgi integrity,"N-terminal acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes, with emerging roles in regulating protein quality and stoichiometry and targeting and complex formation. The NatC complex is one of the three major N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). Here, we partially defined the in vivo human NatC Nt-acetylome by combining siNAA30 mediated knockdown with positional proteomics. We identified 51 human NatC substrates and expanded our current knowledge on the substrate repertoire of NatC which now includes proteins harboring Met-Leu, Met-Ile, Met-Phe, Met-Trp, Met-Tyr, Met-Trp, Met-Met, Met-His and Met-Lys N-termini. Next to cytosolic proteins, several organellar proteins were identified as NatC substrates. Interestingly, upon Naa30 depletion, the levels of several organellar proteins were reduced, in particular those of mitochondrial proteins. Further, knockdown of Naa30 induced the loss of membrane potential, clearing and fragmentation of mitochondria. Naa30 depletion also led to disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. However, Naa30 depletion did not affect ER morphology, endosome or peroxisome distribution or microtubule and actin cytoskeletal architecture, suggesting that the observed mitochondrial fragmentation and clearance and Golgi scattering are not due to general disruption of organelles or microtubules. In conclusion, NatC Nt-acetylates a large variety of cytosolic and organellar proteins and is essential for cis-Golgi integrity and mitochondrial function.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""skin""]","[{""ptm"":""L-methionine (S)-sulfoxide"",""UNIMOD"":""39#C""},{""ptm"":""6x(13)C,4x(15)N labeled L-arginine"",""UNIMOD"":""267""},{""ptm"":""S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine"",""UNIMOD"":""6#C""},{""ptm"":""3x(2)H labeled N6-acetyl-L-lysine"",""UNIMOD"":""56#K""},{""ptm"":""2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"",""UNIMOD"":""28#Q""},{""ptm"":""N-acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"human, Naa30, Golgi, Mitochondria, N-terminal COFRADIC","The generated MS/MS peak lists were searched with Mascot using the Mascot Daemon interface (version 2.2.0, Matrix Science).

We improved the precision and accuracy of peptide-ion intensity based quantification in order to enable accurate determination of protein turnover in non-dividing cells using dynamic-SILAC. This enabled precise and accurate protein half-life determination ranging from 10 to more than 1000 hours. We achieve good proteomic coverage ranging from four to six thousand proteins in several types of non-dividing cells, corresponding to a total of 9699 unique proteins over the entire dataset. Good agreement was observed in half-lives between B-cells, natural killer cells and monocytes, while hepatocytes and mouse embryonic neurons showed substantial differences.  Our comprehensive dataset enabled extension and statistical validation of the previous observation that subunits of protein complexes tend to have coherent turnover. Furthermore, we observed complex architecture dependent turnover within complexes of the proteasome and the nuclear pore complex.

In this study, further exploration of the paramagnetic bead-based approach, Single-Pot Solid-Phase-Enhanced Sample Preparation (SP3), is carried out. The SP3 approach was tested in a wide range of experimental scenarios, including: 1. Binding solvents (acetonitrile, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone); 2. Binding pH (acidic vs. neutral/basic); 3. Solvent/lysate ratios (50% - 200%, v/v); 4. Mixing and rinsing conditions (on-rack vs. off-rack rinsing); 5. Enrichment of non-denatured proteins; 6. Enrichment of individual proteins from non-complex mixtures. These results highlight the robust handling of proteins in a broad set of scenarios, while also enabling development of a modified SP3 workflow that offers extended functionality. The modified SP3 approach is used in quantitative in-depth proteome analyses to compare it with commercial paramagnetic bead-based HILIC methods (MagReSyn) and across multiple binding conditions (e.g. pH and solvent during binding). Together, these data reveal the extensive quantitative coverage of the proteome possible with SP3 independent of the binding approach utilized. The results further establish the utility of SP3 for the unbiased handling of peptides and proteins for proteomic applications.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Glu-\u003epyro-Glu"",""UNIMOD"":""27""},{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Gln-\u003epyro-Glu"",""UNIMOD"":""28""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex"",""UNIMOD"":""737""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion ETD""]","[""Technical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"SP3, HILIC, mass spectrometry, protein clean-up, TMT",Data were processed using SearchGUI and PeptideShaker as described.

DPCs are frequently occurring in cells, either as a consequence of metabolism or exogenous agents. The mechanism of DPCs removal is not completely understood. Here, we characterize SPRTN (DVC1) as specialised DNA-dependent metalloprotease for DPC removal in humans. SPRTN has an N-terminal metalloprotease domain that cleaves various DNA binding substrate during S-phase progression. SPRTN is a part of replisome and removes DPCs during DNA replication fork progression, thus protecting proliferative cells from DPCs toxicity. Ruijs-Aalfs Syndrome (RJALS) patient cells with monogenic mutations in SPRTN are hypersensitive to DPC-inducing agents due to DPC removal defect and DNA replication fork stalling. We propose a model where SPRTN protease forms specialised DNA-replication coupled DPC removal pathway essential for DNA replication fork progression and genome stability.

The protein extraction protocol is based on the addition of calcium phosphate to non-adjusted pH human milk. The combination of calcium ions with phosphate results in an effective co-precipitation of caseins. To assess the suitability of this fractionation protocol, the protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, LC-MS/MS and CE analysis. The results evidence a significant decrease in contamination of casein fraction with whey proteins and vice versa compared with the conventional isoelectric precipitation of caseins. In addition, CE fraction collection coupled to LC-MS/MS (off-line coupling) has been successfully applied to the identification of minor proteins in this complex matrix.

Through a targeted drug screen, we found the recently approved multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin to have potent activity in several lung cancer cells independent of its intended target, PKC, or a specific genomic marker. To determine the underlying mechanism of action we applied a layered functional proteomics approach and a new data integration method. Using chemical proteomics, we identified multiple midostaurin kinase targets in these cells. Network-based integration of these targets with quantitative tyrosine and global phosphoproteomics data using protein-protein interactions from the STRING database suggested multiple targets are relevant for the mode of action of midostaurin. Subsequent functional validation using RNA interference and selective small molecule probes showed that simultaneous inhibition of TBK1, PDK1 and AURKA was required to elicit midostaurin’s cellular effects. Immunoblot analysis of downstream signaling nodes showed that combined inhibition of these targets altered PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathways that in part converged on PLK1. Furthermore, rational combination of midostaurin with the more potent PLK1 inhibitor BI2536, which is in advanced clinical trials, elicited strong synergy. Our results demonstrate that combination of complementary functional proteomics approaches and subsequent network-based data integration can reveal novel insight into the complex mode of action of multi-kinase inhibitors, actionable targets for drug discovery and cancer vulnerabilities.

The use of biomarkers in stroke might have a major impact in patients’ management, both in the diagnosis and the prognosis. Thus, the analysis of the brain proteome is a straightforward approach for the identification of specific biomarkers and for the detection of potential new therapeutic targets for neuroprotection or recovery strategies.  In this study, post-mortem brain slices from ischemic stroke patients were obtained corresponding to infarcted (IC) and contralateral (CL) areas. By means of laser microdissection, neurons and blood brain barrier structures (BBB) were isolated and analyzed in a label-free manner on a LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro MS following a gas phase fractionation approach for precursor ion selection. Ninety one proteins were identified only in neurons, 261 proteins only in BBB and 260 proteins in both cell types (peptides≥2). Gene ontology analyses revealed the alteration of metabolic processes after brain ischemia and also changes regarding catalytic activity and binding. Antioxidant activity and enzyme regulator activity appeared as cell-specific altered molecular functions. A total of 25 proteins showing p<0.05 and fold-change>|2| between IC and CL areas were considered significant in this study: 11 in neurons, 11 in BBB and 3 in both cell types. Twelve of these proteins were selected as candidates and analyzed by immunohistochemistry in independent brains. The MS findings were verified for neuronal SAHH2 and SRSF1 and for EAA2 in both cell types. In addition, SAHH2 showed its potential as prognostic biomarker when analyzed early in plasma of ischemic stroke patients.  Therefore, our results will contribute to increase the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of ischemic stroke pathology and launch new proteins that might represent putative biomarkers of brain ischemia or therapeutic targets.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""brain""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"stroke, brain ischemia, laser micro-dissection, label-free, proteomics, biomarker","Protein quantification and identification Progenesis LC-MS® software v4.0 (Nonlinear dynamics, UK) was used for MS data analysis using default settings.

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""breast""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts, comparative proteome profiling, label-free quantification, primary human cells, tissue proteomics.","Protein identification was carried out using ProteomeDiscoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) by searching against the SwissProt Database (version December 2012 with 20,209 protein entries) supplemented with common contaminant proteins.

The patients affected gradually lose cognitive function, control over their sense of orientation, their emotions, and other aspects of behavior. Thirty-five million people are now considered to be affected by AD and this number is expected to double in the next few decades. We utilized an AD cell model system for a proteomic study by using mass spectrometry. To mimic early events in AD, LAN5 neuroblastoma cell were incubated for a short time with a recombinant form of Aβ42 (rAβ42), a peptide involved in AD, and the extracted proteins were utilized for the proteome analysis. Furthermore, we used bioinformatics tools to identify networks, associated processes, pathways, etc. The potential modulation of pathways suggested by the similarity of GO terms and presence of protein-protein interaction networks among significantly modulated proteins was explored using the bioinformatic tool KEGG. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted for up and down regulated protein groups, and four pathways were identified. In particular, the Spliceosome pathway identified in the under-expressed protein group was reported by KEGG to be the most significantly enriched. To confirm the effect of Aβ42 on the spliceosomal pathway, the level of expression of SmB/B’/N (a component of the spliceosomal machinery) was measured. However, further studies are necessary to fully elucidate the the down-regulation effect of the spliceosome proteins in AD, and how this may contribute to the early event in this disorder.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","Alzheimer’s disease, Aβ42, splicing, AD early events, orbitrap, Human","Proteome Discoverer platform (version 1.3; Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany), interfaced with an in-house Mascot server (version 2.3, Matrix Science, London, UK), was used for data parsing and protein identification, according to the following criteria: Database UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (release 2012_05), Enzyme Trypsin, Maximum Missed Cleavage Sites 2, Taxonomy Homo sapiens, Precursor Mass Tolerance 10 ppm, Fragment Mass Tolerance 0.2 Da, Cysteine Carbamidomethylation as Static modification, N-terminal Glutamine conversion to Pyro-glutammic Acid and Methionine Oxidation as Dynamic modifications.

Peptide and protein grouping according to Proteome Discoverer’s algorithms were allowed, applying strict maximum parsimony principle. Label-free quantification based on spectral count (SpC) values was used as a semi-quantitative measure to evaluate protein abundance and to compare the expression of the same protein among different samples, as described previously (Addis MF et al., (2011).

A histone fasta file is built from the Uniprot human database (57 entries, including H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). Two datasets (noted as HCD_Histone and CID_Histone) are obtained from the same HeLa histone sample. We note that some precursor m/z values exported by the instrument software Xcalibur are not monoisotopic, and some MS/MS spectra are from two or more co-fragmented peptides. Therefore, we use pParse to convert RAW files to MGF files by exporting the monoisotopic peaks of all precursors, including co-eluted precursors (1). The MGF files are searched using pFind, Mascot, Sequest HT in ProteomeDiscoverer, ProteinPilot, and PEAKS. Because OMSSA in COMPASS, X!Tandem in TPP, and Andromeda in MaxQuant have their own input format, we then convert MGF files to TXT files for OMSSA, use ReAdW (2) to convert RAW files to mzXML files for X!Tandem (in which some precursors are calibrated to the monoisotopic but no co-eluted peptides are exported), and use RAW files directly for Andromeda (in MaxQuant the ‘second peptide’ mode can detect some co-eluted peptides).  Search parameters ─ Search parameters are set for all search engines. The version of each search engine is shown in Supplemental Table 2. We set the following search parameters (as shown in Table 1): precursor mass tolerance ±10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance ±0.02 Th for HCD and ±0.4 Th for CID, trypsin only cleaving after arginine and up to 2 miscleavages, peptide N-terminal propionylation (Propionyl[Peptide N-term]/+56.026) as the fixed modification. To obtain more identification for different kinds of peptides, we set seven sets of variable modifications: (1) only Propionyl[K]/+56.026 for unmodified peptides, (2) Propionyl[K]/+56.026 and Acetyl[K]/+42.011 for acetylated peptides, (3) Propionyl[K]/+56.026 and Methyl_Propionyl[K]/+70.042 for mono-methylated peptides, (4) Propionyl[K]/+56.026 and Dimethyl[K]/+28.031 for di-methylated peptides, (5) Propionyl[K]/+56.026 and Trimethyl[K]/+42.047 for tri-methylated peptides, Propionyl[K]/+56.026 and Phospho[ST]/+79.966 for phosphorylated peptides, and all the above modifications for multi-modified peptides.

Firstly, RAW files are converted to MGF files, TXT files, and mzXML files. Secondly, each search engine searches with separate modifications. Thirdly, search results are filtered for separate modifications. The target-decoy approach is used in most search engines (3), except TPP, which uses probability to filter search results (4). A FDR of less than 1% at the spectra level is used to filter search results. Fourthly, redundant IDs are removed. When there are redundant spectra in different searches for one specific engine, the peptide-spectral matches with higher scores were kept. Lastly, to obtain confident results, all the filtered IDs for different search engines are combined. The number of search engines identifying one specific spectrum is counted, and spectra identified by only one search engine are filtered out.    1. Yuan, Z. F.; Liu, C.; Wang, H. P.; Sun, R.

Altering Ki-67 expression levels did not significantly affect cell proliferation in vivo. Ki-67 mutant mice developed normally and cells lacking Ki-67 proliferated efficiently. Conversely, upregulation of Ki-67 expression in differentiated tissues did not inhibit cell cycle arrest. Ki-67 interactors included proteins involved in nucleolar processes and chromatin regulators. Ki-67 depletion disrupted nucleologenesis but did not inhibit pre-rRNA processing. In contrast, it altered gene expression. Ki-67 silencing also had wide-ranging effects on chromatin organisation, disrupting heterochromatin compaction and long-range genomic interactions. Trimethylation of histone H3K9 and H4K20 at heterochromatin was strongly reduced. Overexpression of human or Xenopus Ki-67 induced ectopic heterochromatin formation.

PXD003037,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD003037,Systemic remodeling of translation efficiencies on oxygen stimulus.,"Protein concentrations evolve under greater evolutionary constraint than mRNA levels. In addition, translation efficiency of mRNA populations represents the chief determinant of basal protein concentrations.   This raises a fundamental question as to how mRNA and protein levels are actively coordinated in dynamic systems responding to acute physiological stimuli. This report examines the contributions of mRNA abundance and translation efficiency to protein output in cells responding to oxygen stimulus. We show that alternative translation efficiencies, not mRNA levels, represent the major adaptive mechanism that governs the cellular response to perturbations in [O2]. This phenomenon is coordinated by eIF4F under atmospheric [O2] and the previously uncharacterized hypoxic eIF4F (eIF4FH) under low [O2]. The oxygen-regulated remodeling of translation efficiency enables oxygenated and hypoxic cells to produce surprisingly divergent translatomes of similar complexity, with minimal dependence on mRNA levels. Changes in mRNA concentrations observed between normoxic and hypoxic cells are likely neutral, as they are during evolution. We propose that mRNAs contain hard-wired translation efficiency determinants for their triage by the translation apparatus on [O2] stimulus.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Dehydrated"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Label:13C(6)15N(4)"",""UNIMOD"":""267""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""Label:13C(6)15N(2)"",""UNIMOD"":""259""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap"",""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]","[""SILAC""]","Hypoxia, cancer, translation, RNA sequencing, SILAC, eIF4E, eIF4E2","Raw data generated by LC-MS/MS (peaklists generated by Xcalibur 2.2) were analyzed using Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for ion current analysis, and were searched against the international protein index human database, downloaded from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/IPIhelp.html (downloaded May 13 2014).

In this respect, biomechanical stimulation can trigger significant physiological cascades that can potentially modulate or interact with toxicity. Deoxynivalenol (DON, vomitoxin) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins produced by Fusarium spp. and it was used to explore the delicate interaction between biomechanical stimulation and cytotoxic processes in A431 cells. In fact, in addition of being a well-known food contaminant, DON is becoming a relevant toxin also for other organ systems. The combination between biomechanical stimulation and the mycotoxin revealed how DON can impair crucial functions like cellular morphology and lysosome trafficking at concentrations far below those known to be cytotoxic in routine toxicity studies. Moreover, sub-toxic concentrations of DON (0.1-1 μM) impaired the capability of A431 cells to respond to a biomechanical stimulation that normally sustains trophic effects in this cell line. Ultimately, the effects of DON (0.1-10 μM) were partially modulated by the application of uniaxial stretching (0.5Hz, 24h, 15% deformation) suggesting a deep cross-talk between the cytotoxic potential of the mycotoxin and the biomechanical stimulation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""skin""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Deoxynivalenol (DON, vomitoxin); uniaxial cell stretching; A431 cells; biomechanical stimulation","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification searching against the SwissProt Database (version 01/2018 with 20 258 entries) allowing a mass tolerance of 50ppm for MS spectra and 100mmu for MS/MS spectra, a FDR < 0.01 and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages.

An insufficient understanding of mechanisms underlying tumor cell responses to chemotherapy contributes significantly to the lack of effective treatment regimens. Here, paclitaxel, a first-line chemotherapeutic agent, was observed to interact synergistically with birinapant, a Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator of Caspases mimetic. Therefore, we investigated molecular-level drug interaction mechanisms using comprehensive, reproducible, and well-controlled ion-current-based MS1 quantification (IonStar). In a set of 40 biological samples, we compared temporal proteomic responses of PDAC cells treated with birinapant and paclitaxel, alone and combined. Using stringent criteria (e.g. strict false-discovery-rate FDR control, 2 peptides/protein), we quantified 4069 unique proteins confidently (99.8% without any missing data), and 541 proteins were significantly altered in the three treatment groups with a FDR of <1%. Interestingly, most of these proteins were altered only by combined birinapant/paclitaxel, and these predominantly represented three biological processes: mitochondrial function, cell growth and apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. Proteins responsible for activation of oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid β-oxidation, and inactivation of aerobic glycolysis were altered largely by combined birinapant/paclitaxel compared to single drugs, suggesting that the Warburg effect, which is employed by PDAC cells for survival and proliferation, was alleviated by the combination treatment. Metabolic profiling confirmed substantially greater suppression of the Warburg effect by the combined agents compared to either drug alone. Western blot analysis confirmed changes in apoptosis/survival signaling pathways, such as inhibition of PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and MAPK/ERK signal transduction, as well as induction of G2/M arrest, and the drug combination induced much more apoptosis than did single agents. Overall, this in-depth, large-scale proteomics study provided novel insights into molecular mechanisms underlying synergy of combined birinapant/paclitaxel, and describes a proteomics/informatics pipeline that can be applied broadly to the development of cancer drug combination regimens.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""pancreatic cancer cell""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","Human, pancreatic cancer, LC-MSMS","The MS-GF+ searching engine (released on May 17, 2013) was employed to identify peptides by scoring MS/MS spectra against peptides derived from the Uniprot-Swissprot protein database (Homo sapiens, 20212 entries, released on July 2015).

The ion-current area under the curve (AUC) of same peptide was integrated into the same frame according to the following criteria: m/z width = 10 ppm; frame time width = 2.5 min. The merged feature intensity file was further processed using the IonStar data processing pipeline for proper data normalization (i.e. total ion-current normalization) and summarization (i.e. sum of intensities). Peptides shared by different proteins were excluded in order to quantify only the unique peptides of each protein. The relative expression ratios of proteins in two groups were calculated by comparing average ion current intensities of replicates in each group, and the statistical significance was evaluated with ANOVA. The cut-off for altered proteins and false-positive altered protein discovery rate were established using an Experimental Null method(27) (below).",2017-12-18,"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra117.000519"",""PMID:29358341""]]"

Then, to examine changes in cellular signaling, H1993 cells were treated with vehicle controls, BEX-235 (PI3K inhibitor), or Crizotinib.  LC-MS/MS using data dependent acquisition, data-independent acquisition (pSMART), parallel reaction monitoring, and selected reaction monitoring (or multiple reaction monitoring) mass spectrometry were used to detect and relatively quantify the desthiobiotinylated kinase peptides.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lung""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Technical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""TIC""]","DDA, DIA, PRM, SRM/MRM, Activity-Based Protein Profiling, Lung Cancer","Data Processing: For PRIDE upload, LC-MS/MS DDA data were searched against human entries in UniProt (2016_07) with Mascot v.2.5.1.  Enzyme specificity was set to fully tryptic peptides with up to 3 missed cleavages (due to the lysine desthiobiotinylation); the fragmentation model was selected as ESI-QUAD.  Variable modifications included carbamidomethyl-cysteine, desthiobiotinyl-lysine, and oxidized methionine.  Peptide mass tolerance was set to +/-15 ppm; fragment ion tolerance was set to +/-0.05 Th. The spectral library used for DIA analysis was generated using DDA files from many lung cancer cell lines. DIA data files were analyzed using Pinnacle software (OPTYS). DDA LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out using Andromeda and MaxQuant for peptide identification and quantification searching data against human entries in UniProt (Version or date of download) with the following dynamic modifications: methionine oxidation, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and lysine desthiobiotinylation (+196.121178 Da).  Spiked PRTC peptides were assessed for internal QC metrics: retention time stability and ion signal consistency. Peptides lacking peaks in the control samples (DMSO) were removed from the dataset.  Statistical Analysis: Raw peak area values for DDA and DIA datasets were processed to remove minor variability using iterative rank order normalization (IRON), implemented in Galaxy. Statistical analysis and data visualization was performed using R programming in R Studio. The following R packages were used for data processing and visualization: ggplot243, dplyr44, reshape245, LSD46, VennDiagram47, and stringr.  In DIA and DDA datasets, all peptides with less than 3 values across the dataset (n = 18) or that were not seen in the control (DMSO) sample were removed. Peptides with a score less than 3 from the Pinncle software, meaning inadequate MS/MS data for identification or poor MS1 ion signal that was not sufficient for quantification, were removed from DIA datasets. Retention time correlations were also used to remove outliers from the datasets. Concordance across quantitative analysis methods was assessed between peak areas for each data point (protein, peptide, treatment) computing Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R).   Relative quantification (without stable-isotope labeled standards) was performed by log2 transforming the peak areas and the calculating fold changes of inhibitor treat-ment compared to DMSO vehicle controls. If a DMSO peak area was missing or deviated by more than 4x the average peak area across the control replicates, the DMSO peak area for a different technical replicate was used to calculate the fold change (5-15% of peptides, depending on the dataset).

Prompt and accurate diagnosis coupled with the timely administration of parenteral antibiotics is necessary in order to save lives. We used label-free mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics to identify specific protein signatures in cerebrospinal fluid from Malawian children with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children, elderly and people infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Samples were analysed in two independent cohorts (cases and controls, n=12 for the discovery cohort and n=16 for the verification cohort). The protein profiles clearly discriminated cases and controls. Proteins involved in the immune response and exosome cell signaling were significantly enriched in the infected samples. Several S. pneumoniae membrane proteins were identified suggesting these as potential therapeutic targets. For both cohorts, over 200 human proteins were up and down-regulated in children with confirmed S. pneumoniae infection in comparison with controls. Compiling proteins up- and down- regulated in both discovery and verification cohorts, we generated a comprehensive list of over 140 proteins from which diagnostic biomarkers could be nominated. For a panel of five selected proteins (cathelicidin, ceruloplasmin, myeloperoxidase, cystatin C and protein S100A8/S100 A9), we additionally verified the label-free results by automated quantitative western blot immunoassays (Simple Western™), with excellent agreement between the two experimental approaches. The proteins identified in our study could form the basis of development of a biomarker panel for rapid diagnosis. Our results could lead to the development of point-of-care assays to inform diagnosis, and to nominate new targets for drugs and vaccines to improve disease management and consequently to enhance the prognosis of children with bacterial meningitis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cerebrospinal fluid""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"bacterial meningitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, protein quantification",We use the Report builder in mascot to compile identifications using a threshold of at least 2 significant peptides and FDR <1%.,2016-05-24,"[[""DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-07127-6"",""PMID:28765563""]]"

Multiple X-ray crystal structures show that plasticity results in several distinct low energy binding conformations, which are selectively bound by ligands. We demonstrate that computational protein-protein docking can reveal the underlying inter-protein contacts and inform the design of the first BRD4 selective degrader that can discriminate between highly homologous BET bromodomains.

Interestingly, more than 260 proteins showed increased binding to poly(A) RNA in IR-exposed cells and were comprised of many nucleolar proteins. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that DDX54 is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well defined class of pre-mRNAs which harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts.

Acetylation of protein N-termini, pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine and methionine oxidation to methionine-sulfoxide were set as variable modifications. Mass tolerance on precursor ions was set to 10 ppm and on fragment ions to 20 mmu. Trypsin was set as enzyme allowing 1 missed cleavage. The peptide charge was set to 1+, 2+, 3+, and instrument setting was put to ESI-QUAD. False discovery rates (FDR) were obtained by searches against the reversed version of the complete search database and by retaining only the peptide to spectra matches (PSMs) with the highest score in standard or reverse search. The false discovery rate was then calculated by dividing the number of PSMs against the reverse database by the number of PSMs against both databases.",2018-03-29,

It is known that endogenous HLA class I associated peptides may harbor posttranslational modifications. In particular, phosphorylated ligands have raised much interest as potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. By combining affinity purification with high resolution mass spectrometry, we identified more than 2000 unique ligands associated to HLA-B40. Sequence analysis revealed two major anchor motifs: Aspartic or glutamic acid at peptide position 2 (P2) and methionine, phenylalanine or aliphatic residues at the C-terminus. The use of IMAC and TiO2 affinity chromatography allowed the characterization of 86 phosphorylated ligands. Every sequence belonging to this subset was further confirmed by comparing its experimental MS2 spectrum with that obtained upon fragmentation of the corresponding synthetic peptide. Remarkably, three of the identified phospholigands lacked a canonical anchor residue at P2 containing phosphoserine instead. Binding assays showed that this sort of peptides bound to HLA-B40 with high affinity probably due to the molecular mimicry between these residues. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the peptide repertoire of a given HLA allotype can be broadened by the presentation of peptides with posttranslational modifications at major anchor positions. We suggest that ligands with phosphorylated residues at P2 may be optimal targets for T-cell based cancer immunotherapy.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""C1R cell""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""deaminated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""instrument model"",""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"",""Human Proteome Project"",""Human Immuno-Peptidome Project (HUPO-HIPP)"",""Biomedical""]","[""Bottom-up proteomics""]",,"peptidome, HLA, phosphopeptidome, HLA-B40,MHC",Not available,2013-09-03,"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:24366607""]]"

In our previous study, we found that phosphoproteomics is one pleasant means to catch low-abundance and membrane proteins which are phosphorylated. Therefore, we speculate it may be an available approach for MPs detection. In this study, kidney cancer and adjacent tissues were used for phosphoproteomics research, we totally identified 8962 proteins including 6415 phosphoproteins, and 44728 phosphosites, of which 10266 were unreported previously. Interestingly, a total of 75 MPs were found, after rigorous screening and manual checking, 26 MPs were ranked as confident MPs by the verification with the synthesized peptides and a stringent manual check of their MS2 spectra, among which 14 MPs were phosphorylated. Functional analysis for 26 MPs revealed that 16 MPs were found to be membrane proteins, 7 MPs were testis-enriched and 1 MPs were kidney-specific.

PXD008719,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008719,Curcumin exerts its potential antitumor effects in a context dependent fashion,"Background Clinical practice demonstrates that anticancer drug effects may strongly vary between different patients. Individual responses to drug action are potentially responsible for adverse effects such as establishment of resistance. Consequently, the understanding of response mechanisms to drug actions is of great relevance. Proteome profiling is a powerful tool for the investigation of cellular responses to drugs.  Methods Here, we have investigated the effects of curcumin, a natural remedy with known anti-cancer activities, on breast cancer cells MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and normal mammary fibroblasts as well as co-cultures thereof using proteome profiling. The mammary fibroblasts had been treated before with TGF-beta in order to induce a wound-healing signature known to be representative for the in vivo situation in breast tumors.  Results While co-culture alone induced several proteins like ANXA1, S100A4 and SPARC similarly in both breast cancer cells, the majority of proteins regulated upon co-culture differed between MCF-7 and ZR-75-1. Curcumin significantly induced HMOX1 in all single cell models and co-cultures. However, otherwise the curcumin effects differed. In the MCF-7 co-culture, curcumin significantly downregulated RC3H1, a repressor of inflammatory signaling. In the ZR-75-1 co-culture, curcumin significantly downregulated PEG10, an anti-apoptotic protein, and induced RRAGA, a pro-apoptotic protein involved in TNF-alpha signaling. In this model, curcumin also induced AKR1C2, an important enzyme for progesterone metabolism. None of these specific curcumin effects were observed in single cell cultures.  Conclusions The present data demonstrate that curcumin induces proteome alterations potentially accounting for its known antitumor effects in a strongly context-dependent fashion.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","Curcumin, co-culture, breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblast, proteome profiling, anti-cancer drug","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification.

PXD006901,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006901,Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma aggressiveness associated with differential expression of collagen and STAT1,"Background: Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (vSCC) is a rare but debilitating disease. One vSCC subtype comprises tumor cells that grow and expand as a cohesive sheet of cells that “pushes” and compresses the associated lymphoplasmacytic (LPC) stroma. Another vSCC subtype features tumor cells that grow in loose association with other tumor cells and infiltrate the associated fibromyxoid (FMX) stroma consisting mainly of extracellular matrix. Clinically, infiltrative vSCC with FMX stroma (Inf/FMX) is significantly associated with lymph node metastases and recurrence. Methods: An unbiased proteomic approach was used to identify pathways that could produce these different vSCC subtypes. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from 10 cases of pushing vSCC with LPC stroma (Push/LPC) and 8 cases of Inf/FMX were subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: Analysis identified 2,265 different proteins in the 18 samples of vSCC. Of these, 344 proteins were differentially expressed (p<0.05) by at least 4-fold between vSCC subtypes. Of these, 59 were higher and 285 lower in Inf/FMX compared to Push/LPC tumors. Consistent with the desmoplastic morphology and increased picrosirius red staining, expression of subunits of several collagens (Col 1, 3, 6, 14, 18) was higher in the more aggressive Inf/FMX tumors. In contrast, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), an important regulator of several inflammatory pathways, was expressed at lower levels in the Inf/FMX tumors. This finding was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using an antibody to STAT1. An informatics analysis of the differing profiles identified differences in the integrin signaling pathway and inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway. This analysis also linked decreased expression of proteins involved antigen processing and presentation and increased expression of those with cell-matrix adhesion as processes with the more aggressive Inf/FMX vSCC subtype. Conclusions: Comparing the proteomic profiles of vSCC morphologic subtypes indicates that increased expression of collagen subunits and decreased expression of STAT1 are associated with a more aggressive tumor subtype. Informatic analyses further identify alterations in cell interaction with matrix and immune function differ with tumor aggressiveness. Identification of these pathways provides a molecular basis for understanding aggressiveness of vSCC.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""squamous cell carcinoma cell""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]","[""MaxQuant percentage""]","Human, FFPE Tissue, cytokine, cell adhesion, stroma immune","Proteins were identified by searching the UniProtKB database (restricted to Homo sapiens, 157537 entries) using the Andromeda search engine in MaxQuant (version 1.5.3.8).

PXD004734,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD004734,Identification of novel SHARPIN binders,"Sharpin, a multifunctional adaptor protein with oncogenic properties, regulates several signalling pathways. For example, Sharpin enhances signal-induced NF-κB signalling as part of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) and inhibits integrins, the T cell receptor, caspase1 and PTEN. However, despite recent insights into Sharpin and LUBAC function, a systematic approach to identify signalling pathways regulated by Sharpin has not been reported. Here, we present the first ‘Sharpin interactome’, which identifies a large amount of novel potential Sharpin interactors. These data suggest that Sharpin and LUBAC might regulate a larger number of biological processes than previously identified, such as endosomal trafficking, RNA processing, metabolism and cytoskeleton regulation. Importantly, using the Sharpin interactome we have identified a novel role for Sharpin in lamellipodium formation. We demonstrate that Sharpin interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, a protein complex that catalyses actin filament branching, and that Sharpin and Arp2/3 colocalize in lamellipodia. We identified the Arp2/3-binding site in Sharpin and demonstrate using a specific Arp2/3-binding deficient mutant that the Sharpin-Arp2/3 interaction promotes lamellipodia formation in a LUBAC-independent fashion.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","SHARPIN, GFP pull-down, human","The data files were searched for protein identification using Proteome Discoverer (1.4) connected to in-house Mascot (v. 2.4) software.

PXD009575,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009575,"Identification of MOSPD2, a novel scaffold for endoplasmic reticulum membrane contact sites","Membrane contact sites are cellular structures that mediate inter-organelle exchange and communication. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which forms a network extending throughout the cytoplasm, possesses two known major tether proteins, named VAP-A and VAP-B, that allow its interaction with other organelles. VAP-A and VAP-B interact with proteins from other organelles that possess a small VAP-interacting motif, named FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic track), and consequently scaffold contact sites implicating the ER. In this study, by using an unbiased proteomic approach, we identified a novel ER tether named MOtile SPerm Domain-containing protein 2 (MOSPD2). We showed that MOSPD2 possesses a Motile Sperm Protein (MSP) domain which binds FFAT motifs and consequently allows membrane tethering in vitro. Accordingly, MOSPD2, which is an ER-anchored protein, interacts with several FFAT-containing proteins bound to diverse organelles,such as endosomes, mitochondria or Golgi. Consequently, the specific interaction between MOSPD2 and these organelle-bound proteins results in the formation of contact sites between the ER and these organelles. Thus, MOSPD2 is a novel tether for membrane contact sites between the ER and the other cellular organelles.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","MOSPD2, endoplasmic reticulum, FFAT motif",Protein were identified by  Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific).

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell suspension culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""L-histidine residue"",""UNIMOD"":""39#C""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, primary human B lymphocytes, shotgun proteomics, aging, glutaminolysis, fatty acid beta oxidation, Q Exactive orbitrap","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

PXD005539,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD005539,Human melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles reprogram dendritic cells potentially enabling lymph node metastases,"Evolution of melanoma from a primary tumor to widespread metastasis is crucially dependent on lymphatic spread. The mechanisms regulating the initial step in metastatic dissemination via regional lymph nodes remain largely unknown. We have previously described a dysfunctional immune profile that precedes evidence of metastasis in the first node draining from the primary tumor, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Herein, we explore the role of melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as mediators of this pre-metastatic niche through cargo-specific polarization of dendritic cells (DCs). Utilizing mass cytometry, pre-metastatic SLNs demonstrate compromised co-stimulatory CD80 expression compared to healthy lymph nodes. Similarly, DCs matured in vitro in the presence of melanoma EVs showed impaired co-stimulation and polarization towards a chronic inflammatory cytokine milieu.  Profiling of melanoma EV cargo identified shared proteomic and RNA signatures including the signaling axis S100A8, S100A9 and cognate receptor TLR4. Mechanistically, S100A8 and S100A9 compromised DC maturation, a phenotype which was partially recovered following TLR4 blockade. Early evidence demonstrates similar EVs can be isolated from human afferent lymphatic fluid ex vivo.  Taken together, we propose synergistic interactions among melanoma EV cargo are responsible for suppressing DC maturation, potentially explaining the survival of malignant melanocytes metastasizing into seemingly “normal” regional lymph nodes.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Dehydrated"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite"",""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]","[""Peptide counting""]","Extracellular vesicles1, Dendritic cells2, Lymphatics3, Metastasis4, Tumor Immunology5","Tandem mass spectra were extracted by msconvert  and all MS/MS samples were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.4.0) and X!

Here, we show that eIF5B is essential for eukaryotic hypoxia tolerance, reminiscent of how IF2 supports prokaryotic anaerobiosis. Global protein synthesis analyses identified eIF5B as a hypoxia-specific translation factor involved in translocating met-tRNAiMet to initiating ribosomes. Systemic translatome studies revealed that eIF5B-dependent mRNAs encode proteins of central carbon metabolism, fructolysis, and other pathways enhanced in organisms inhabiting hypoxic niches.

PXD003709,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD003709,Preferential phosphorylation on old histones during early mitosis in human cells,"How histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are inherited through cell cycle remains poorly understood. Canonical histones are made in the S phase of cell cycle. Combining mass spectrometry-based technologies and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we interrogate the distributions of multiple major histone PTMs on old versus new histones in synchronized human cells. We show that histone PTMs can be grouped to three categories accordingly to their distributions. Most lysine mono-methylation and acetylation PTMs are either symmetrically distributed on old and new histones, or asymmetric on new histones. In contrast, most di- and tri-methylation PTMs are asymmetric on old histones, suggesting the inheritance of different PTMs is regulated distinctly. Intriguingly, old and new histones are distinguished in their phosphorylation status during early mitosis, in three different human cell types: Hela, 293T and human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells. The mitotic hallmark H3S10ph is predominantly associated with old H3 at early mitosis and become symmetric with the progression of mitosis. The same distribution pattern is found on other mitotic histone phosphorylation marks, including H3T3/T6ph, H3.1/2S28ph and H1.4S26ph, excluding S28/S31ph on the H3 variant H3.3. Although H3S10ph often associates with the neighboring K9 di- or tri-methylation, they are not required for the asymmetric distribution of S10ph on the same H3 tail. Inhibition of the kinase Aurora B does not change the distribution pattern despite significant reduction of H3S10ph levels. K9me2 abundance on the new H3 is significantly reduced after Aurora B inhibition, suggesting a crosstalk between H3S10ph and H3K9me2.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""propanoylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""58""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"histone modifications, histone phosphorylation, cell cycle, mitosis, mass spectrometry","We determine the relative abundance at the MS1 level based on the ratios we obtained, either manually or by a Matlab-based program, EpiProfile(1).

PXD008029,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008029,An adaptive pipeline to maximize isobaric tagging data in large-scale MS-based proteomics,"Isobaric tagging is a method of choice in Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics for comparing multiple conditions at a time. Despite its multiplexing capabilities, when multiple experiments are merged for comparison in large sample-size studies, some drawbacks appears, due to the presence of missing values, which result from the stochastic nature of the Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode. Another indirect cause of data incompleteness might derive from the proteomic-typical data processing workflow that first identifies proteins in individual experiments and then only quantifies those identified proteins, leaving a large number of unmatched spectra with quantitative information unexploited.  Inspired by untargeted metabolomic and label-free proteomic workflows, we developed a quantification-driven bioinformatic pipeline (Quantify then Identify – QtI) that optimizes the processing of isobaric Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) data from large-scale studies. This pipeline includes innovative modules, such as the Peptide Match Rescue (PMR) and the Optimized Post-Translational Modification (OPTM) and outperforms a classical benchmark workflow in terms of quantification and identification rates, significantly reducing missing data while preserving unmatched features for quantitative comparison. The number of unexploited tandem mass spectra was reduced by 77% and 62% for two human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma datasets, respectively.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood plasma"",""cerebrospinal fluid""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Dehydrated"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex"",""UNIMOD"":""737""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Technical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,Algorithms; Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Discovery; Isobaric tagging; Machine learning; Protein identification; Quantification; Tandem mass spectrometry; Tandem mass tag,"First, the .raw files were converted to .mzML peak lists using the ProteoWizard's MSConvert tool.

These bindings were validated by flow cytometry and fluorescence immunostaining. Further, mass spectrometry analysis showed that galectin-1 binds several membrane proteins including HSP90. Finally, functional assays showed that binding of galectin-8 could significantly enhance the acrosome reaction within human sperms.

PXD001668,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001668,Proteomic analyses reveal that loss of TDP-43 affects RNA processing and intracellular transport,"Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a predominantly nuclear, ubiquitously expressed RNA and DNA-binding protein. It recognises and binds to UG repeats and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability and microRNA metabolism. TDP-43 is essential in early embryonic development but accumulates in cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and tau-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). It is not known yet whether cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 are toxic or protective but they are often associated with a loss of TDP-43 from the nucleus and neurodegeneration may be caused by a loss of normal TDP-43 function or a gain of toxic function. Here we present a proteomic study to analyse the effect of loss of TDP-43 on the proteome. Our results indicate that TDP-43 is an important regulator of RNA metabolism and intracellular transport. We show that Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1), DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (Dnmt3a) and chromogranin B (CgB) are downregulated upon TDP-43 knockdown. Subsequently, transportin 1 level is increased as a result of RanBP1 depletion. Improper regulation of these proteins and the subsequent disruption of cellular processes may play a role in the pathogenesis of the TDP-43 proteinopathies ALS and FTLD.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]",,"TDP-43, RanBP1, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, comparative proteomics, intracellular transport","Peak lists were generated by extract_msn_com.exe (version 5.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and searched against UniProt/SwissProt human database (version 2014_01, 20267 protein entries) using Mascot (version 2.3.01, Matrix Science).

However, other than the underlying genotypes of these conditions, a limited knowledge exists of the exact pathomechanisms of these disorders. This study expands on our previous research investigating dystrophic stromal aggregates, with the aim of better elucidating the pathomechanism of 2 conditions arising from the most common TGFBI mutations: granular corneal dystrophy (GCD1; R555W), and lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD1; R124C). GCD1 and LCD1 patient corneas were stained with H&E and Congo red to visualise stromal non-amyloid and amyloid deposits, respectively. Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate aggregates and extracted protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Proteins were identified and their approximate abundances were determined. Spectra of TGFBIp peptides were also recorded and quantified. In total, 3 proteins were found within GCD1 aggregates that were absent in the healthy control corneal tissue. In comparison an additional 18 and 24 proteins within stromal LCD1 and Bowman’s LCD1 deposits, respectively, were identified. Variances surrounding the endogenous cleavage sites of TGFBIp were also noted. An increase in the number of residues experiencing cleavage was observed in both GCD1 aggregates and LCD1 deposits. The study reveals previously unknown differences 1 between the protein composition of GCD1 and LCD1 aggregates, and confirms the presence of the HtrA1 protease in LCD1-amyloid aggregates. In addition, we find mutation specific differences in the processingof mutant TGFBIp species, which may contribute to the variable phenotypes noted in TGFBI-related dystrophies.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cornea""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""emPAI""]","Human cornea, Lattice corneal dystrophy, Granular corneal dystrophy","Identification and semi quantification of proteins Raw data from the LC-MS/MS was converted to mgf format using AB SCIEX MS Data Converter beta 1.1 and the “proteinpilot mgf” parameters, and peptides were searched using an in-house Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version: 2.5.0) and queried against the Swiss-Prot database (version: 2014_11).

All searches had a p-value <0.01 applied and an expected value of 0.005. Only protein hits identified by a minimum of two peptides with Mascot ion scores above 30 were considered for further analyses. All cytokeratins identified within the analysis were regarded as contaminants and removed from the proteome profiles, as carried out in previous studies.9 In addition, porcine tryptic peptides identical to human peptides were removed as porcine trypsin was used during the processing of the samples. The remaining proteins were arranged based on their exponentially modified Protein Abundance Index values (emPAI) reflecting their abundances within the aggregates. To compile a comprehensive list of proteins found in multiple GCD1 and LCD1 aggregates, relative abundances were calculated for proteins present in at least 2 tissues of the same biological significance. Relative abundance was termed as the average emPAI value for each protein across biological samples divided by the sum of the emPAI values of all proteins present within the tissue specimens. These values were then recorded as 1 a percentage for all proteins within each biological group,11 (Supplementary Table S1).  Determining spectral counts for tryptic and semi-tryptic TGFBIp peptides Spectral counts were carried out for every TGFBIp peptide with no missed cleavages, using methods previously described.7,8 Initially tryptic and semi-tryptic peptides were separated, with tryptic peptides being those identified as cleaved by trypsin during sample preparation on the C-terminal side of a Lys or Arg residue at both termini, while the list of semi-tryptic peptides included those cleaved on the C-terminal side of a Lys or Arg residue in just one terminus, and containing a non-tryptic cleavage site at the other peptide terminus. These non-tryptic cleavage site events are most likely due to the processing of TGFBIp by endogenous proteases present within the tissue samples collected. Spectral counts for all technical replicates were performed using the MS Data Miner v.1.3.0 software.12 Spectral count ratios were calculated by dividing the count of spectra for each TGFBIp peptide by the total number of spectra for tryptic or semi-tryptic TGFBIp peptides. Spectral count ratios were displayed as a percentage. The spectral count ratio for each peptide from each tissue was also presented graphically and grouped by disease. Significance of the variance between counts from disease tissue compared to those from control tissue was calculated using Fisher’s LSD test. In addition, the positions and frequencies of non-tryptic TGFBIp peptide cleavage sites were counted.  Statistics Three LC-MS/MS technical replicates 1 were run for each sample.

To determine the role of inflammation and the specific contribution of activated fibroblasts in cancer development and progression we analyzed six human CRC tissue specimens and paired normal adjacent mucosa samples by LS/MS-MS. Amongst other, indeed several inflammation associated proteins were found differentially expressed compared to normal colonic mucosa. Two candidate molecules, SPARC and THBS2 were recently identified as proteins of a fibroblast inflammation signature. Analysis of public available RNA expression datasets revealed, that the mRNA of both SPARC and THBS2 are upregulated in CRC, typically in association with the CRC consensus molecular subtype 4 [CMS4]. Immunohistochemistry staining also demonstrated upregulation of SPARC and THBS2 in the tumor stroma compared to normal adjacent mucosa and indicated co-localization with the mesenchymal marker [alpha]SMA. In vitro 3D co-culture experiments with human colon derived fibroblasts and CRC cell lines resulted in enhanced SPARC and THBS2 protein levels when both cell types were cultivated in direct physical contact, compared to fibroblasts or cancer cells alone. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting tumor-specific signatures by LC-MS/MS and compatibility with RNA expression datasets.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell suspension culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, primary human B lymphocytes, shotgun proteomics, aging, glutaminolysis, fatty acid beta oxidation, Q Exactive orbitrap","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

PXD003628,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD003628,SNX27 interactome during immune synapse formation,"T lymphocyte recognition of antigenic peptides on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC) leads to immune synapse formation (IS). By analogy with the nervous synapse, this cell-cell communication model requires the formation of highly organized structures that delimit an active zone of membrane traffic. For T cells to connect antigen recognition with the biological response, receptors and signaling proteins must be recycled. Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) is an endosomal protein best known for its role in recycling PDZ (PSD95, Dlg1, ZO-1)-interacting neuronal proteins via the retromer transport machinery. Alteration of this sorting pathway leads to neurodegeneration and is associated to Down syndrome, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. In T lymphocytes, SNX27 interacts with diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKz), which provides a mechanistic link between diacylglycerol metabolism and membrane trafficking. Following antigen recognition, SNX27-positive endosomes polarize to the IS and a PDZ-dependent SNX27 pool accumulates at the cell-cell contact area. To test for additional SNX27 functions, we carried out proteomic analysis of the SNX27 interactome purified from T cells in contact with APC, and identified SNX27 interaction with the retromer and with members of the WASH (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue) complex. This finding indicates the conserved nature of the SNX27/WASH/retromer complex in hematopoietic cells and suggests similarity between neurological diseases and abnormal immune/inflammatory responses. We also found PDZ-dependent SNX27 cargoes, including modulators of cytoskeletal reorganization such as zona occludens-2 (ZO-2).  ZO-2, a cytosolic component of epithelial cell-cell junctions, localized to the IS, and SNX27 silencing affected ZO-2 stability at the synapse. This study broadens our knowledge of SNX27 function in T lymphocytes, and suggests that pathways that delimit polarized structures in epithelial systems also participate in IS regulation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""JURKAT cell""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]",,"SNX27, ZO-2, PDZ,  immune synapse, T-lymphocyte","MS and MS/MS data for each sample fraction were processed using Analyst TF 1.7 Software.

MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, leukemic primary sample, LC-MSMS, MHC class I, immunopeptidome","Peptides were identified using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solution Inc.) and peptide sequences were searched against the 10H080 global cancer database that was built using 10H080 RNA-sequencing data (reference genome used: GRCh38.88, total number of proteins in database: 2,220,337).

Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are a promising tool for biomedical application, but they are immature and have not undergone metabolic shift related to early postnatal development. Cultivation of hiPSC-CM in 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) format leads to morphological maturation. This study compared the mitochondrial and metabolic state of hiPSC-CM in standard 2D culture and the EHT format and determined the influence of contractile activity. HiPSC-CM in EHTs showed ~2-fold higher number of mitochondria (electron microscopy), mitochondrial mass (mitotracker), DNA (Mt-ND1, Mt-ND2), and protein abundance (proteome) than in 2D culture. While hiPSC-CM exhibited the principal ability to use glucose, lactate and fatty acids as energy substrates irrespective of culture format, hiPSC-CM in 3D performed more oxidation of glucose, lactate and fatty acid, and less anaerobic glycolysis. The increase in mitochondrial mass and DNA in 3D was diminished by pharmacological inhibition of contractile force, suggesting that contractile work participates in mitochondrial development hiPSC-CM.

Several studies have been successfully used to identify phosphorylated proteins and dynamic changes in phosphorylation status after stimulation. Nevertheless, it is still rather difficult to elucidate precise complex phosphorylation signaling pathways. In particular, how signal transduction pathways directly communicate from the outer cell surface through cytoplasmic space and then directly into chromatin networks to change the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape remains poorly understood. Here we describe the optimization and comparison of methods based on thiophosphorylation affinity enrichment, which can be utilized to monitor phosphorylation signaling into chromatin by isolation of phosphoprotein containing nucleosomes, a method we term phosphorylation-specific chromatin affinity purification (PS-ChAP). We utilized this PS-ChAP approach in combination with quantitative proteomics to identify changes in the phosphorylation status of chromatin bound proteins on nucleosomes following perturbation of transcriptional processes. We also demonstrate that this method can be employed to map phosphoprotein signaling into chromatin containing nucleosomes through identifying the genes those phosphorylated proteins are found on via thiophosphate PS-ChAP-qPCR. Thus, our results showed that PS-ChAP offers a new strategy for studying cellular signaling and chromatin biology, allowing us to directly and comprehensively investigate phosphorylation signaling into chromatin to investigate if these pathways are involved in altering gene expression.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]",,PROTEOMICS thiophosphorylation signaling,"pFind Studio 2.8 was used for data analysis, including pFind for database search (1, 2) and pBuild for result validation.

This is highly relevant for granzymes A and K where a debate is ongoing concerning their involvement in either cytotoxic or inflammatory processes, or in both. In order to tackle such contradictions, detailed knowledge of the substrate repertoires and substrate specificities of granzymes as well as their cleavage efficiencies may add in unraveling the primary signaling pathways these granzymes are involved in. Therefore, a degradome analysis using N-terminal COFRADIC was performed to unravel the substrate repertoires and subsite determinants for the closely related homologous human tryptases.

While these peak lists were generated, grouping of spectra was allowed with a maximum intermediate retention time of 30 s, and a maximum intermediate scan count of 5 was used where possible. Grouping was done with 0.005 Da precursor tolerance. A peak list was only generated when the MS/MS spectrum contained more than 10 peaks. There was no deisotoping and the relative signal-to-noise limit was set at 2. These peak lists were then searched with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) using the Mascot Daemon interface (version 2.3, Matrix Science).

Variable modifications were set to pyro-glutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine and acetylation or trideutero-acetylation of the N-terminus. Fixed modifications were set as trideutero-acetylation of lysine, carbamidomethylated cysteine, and methionine oxidation (to its sulfoxide derivative). Mass tolerance on precursor ion was set to 10 ppm (with Mascot’s C13 option set to 1) and on fragment ion to 0.5 Da.

The software tries to fit an ideal isotopic distribution on the experimental data based on the peptide average amino acid composition. This is followed by extraction of the XIC signal of all peptide components (light, medium and heavy) from the raw data, and ratios are calculated by comparing the XIC peak areas of all matched light versus medium, light versus heavy, and medium versus heavy peptides (integration method “trapezium”, integration source “survey”). To calculate this ratio value, a least-squares fit to the component intensities from the different scans in the XIC peak was created. MS scans used for this ratio calculation are situated in the elution peak of the precursor determined by the Distiller software (XIC threshold 0.3, XIC smooth 1, Max XIC width 250). To validate the calculated ratio, the standard error on the least-square fit has to be below 0.16, and correlation coefficient of the isotopic envelope should be above 0.97.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, primary human B lymphocytes, shotgun proteomics, aging, glutaminolysis, fatty acid beta oxidation, Q Exactive orbitrap","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

PXD005798,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD005798,Quantitative chemical proteomic analysis of YnMyr-tagged proteins in HeLa cells infected with RV16,"Rhinovirus causes the common cold and drives exacerbation in asthma and COPD, leading to substantial morbidity and healthcare cost. The single positive strand RNA genome of this non-enveloped virus is translated into a single polyprotein that is processed by virus 3C protease to form three structural capsid proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3, and other proteins required for viral life cycle completion. Capsid proteins assemble into the 5S capsid protomer, five of which form a 14S pentamer, and 12 pentamers then assemble to form the 150S icosahedral provirion into which the viral genome is incorporated. During the final step of viral maturation, VP0 is cleaved into VP2 and VP4. VP4 is encoded at the N-terminus of the viral polyprotein, and in many Picornaviruses is N-myristoylated by host cell N-myristoyltransferase (NMT). We have explored the impact of IMP-1088 (the first sub-nanomolar IC50 dual inhibitor of human N-myristoyl transferases HsNMT1 and HsNMT2) on HRV capsid myristoylation in cells. Global identification of proteins for which myristoylation is selectively inhibited by IMP-1088 was performed by quantitative chemical proteomic analysis of YnMyr-tagged proteins in HeLa cells infected with RV16 treated with 50 nM IMP-1088 or vehicle (DMSO). Proteins were subjected to ligation to AzRB, an azide capture reagent bearing a trypsin-cleavable linker and biotin dual label followed by affinity enrichment on Neutravidin beads, on-bead digestion with trypsin, nanoLC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides, and data processing by label-free protein quantification (LFQ) in MaxQuant. 60 N-myristoylated proteins were identified, including the RV16 polyprotein which responded to IMP-1088 inhibition, with no significant change in protein abundances across the whole proteome in the presence of inhibitor. The majority of viral capsid peptides identified in the pull-down mapped to the VP0 domain of the polyprotein, and the N-terminal YnMyr-tagged peptide was readily identified by MS/MS. These data provide the first direct evidence for HRV capsid myristoylation in human cells, and demonstrate that this lipid modification is highly susceptible to inhibition by a selective NMT inhibitor.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"HeLa, RV16, myristoylation, NMT inhibition, proteomics","nLC-MS/MS analysis.

In this latest tumor type, therapy relies on debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Despite the initial high response rates to platinum drugs, most patients relapse and die from the disease. Considering the high levels of thymidylate synthase, dhydrofolate reductase and other folate related proteins in platinum drug resistant patients, pemetrexed was proposed as a second line drugs due to its known mechanism of action that engage the mentioned proteins. However a successful outcome could only be expected on the basis of patients’ stratifications. In the present study, a discovery proteomics approach was applied to tissue samples collected beforepemetrexed treatment from platinum resistant patients who relapsed after the first-line carboplatin-based chemotherapy but responded differently to the pemetrexed treatment.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""ovarian serous carcinoma cell""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""}]","[""impact HD""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","ovarian cancer, platinum drug resistance, discovery proteomics, LC MS/MS","Exported MS2 data from DataAnalysisTM v.4.0 SP4 (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) were submitted to an in-house Mascot Server (Matrix Science, UK; v. 2.4.1), through Mascot Daemon.

In addition, emerging evidence supports the role of IL-23-driven Th17 cells in inflammation. Components of the IL-23 signalling pathway, such as IL23R, JAK2 and STAT3, have been characterised, but elements unique to this network as compared to other interleukins have not been readily addressed. In this study, we have undertaken a multi-stage phosphoproteomics approach to better characterise downstream signalling events. To this end, we performed and compared phosphopeptide and phosphoprotein enrichment methodologies after activation of T lymphocytes by IL-23. We demonstrate the complementary nature of the two phosphor-enrichment approaches by maximising the capture of phosphorylation events. A total of 8069 unique phosphopeptides (containing 8344 unique sites), and 4317 unique phosphorylated proteins were identified, amongst which STAT3, PKM2, CDK6 and LASP-1 clearly showed induction of specific phosphorylation sites that were not readily observed after IL-2 stimulation. Interestingly, we observed subsequent translocation of STAT3 and PKM2 to the nucleus as well as increased phosphorylation especially of the nuclear portion at ~30 min after IL-23 stimulation, suggesting a wide range of cellular responses including proliferation and metabolic adaptation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lymph node""]","[{""ptm"":""Dimethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""36""},{""ptm"":""Dimethyl:2H(4)"",""UNIMOD"":""199""},{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Highlighted"",""Biomedical"",""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free"",""SILAC""]",phosphoproteomics IL-23,"Phosphopeptide analysis: Results are from three different independent biological replicates comparing unstimulated Kit225 cells (t = 0 min) versus Kit225 cells after 30 minutes stimulation with IL-23 (t = 30 min).

Spiked PRTC peptides were assessed for internal QC metrics: retention time stability and ion signal consistency. Peptides lacking peaks in the control samples (DMSO) were removed from the dataset.  Statistical Analysis: Raw peak area values for DDA and DIA datasets were processed to remove minor variability using iterative rank order normalization (IRON), implemented in Galaxy. Statistical analysis and data visualization was performed using R programming in R Studio. The following R packages were used for data processing and visualization: ggplot243, dplyr44, reshape245, LSD46, VennDiagram47, and stringr.  In DIA and DDA datasets, all peptides with less than 3 values across the dataset (n = 18) or that were not seen in the control (DMSO) sample were removed. Peptides with a score less than 3 from the Pinncle software, meaning inadequate MS/MS data for identification or poor MS1 ion signal that was not sufficient for quantification, were removed from DIA datasets. Retention time correlations were also used to remove outliers from the datasets. Concordance across quantitative analysis methods was assessed between peak areas for each data point (protein, peptide, treatment) computing Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R).   Relative quantification (without stable-isotope labeled standards) was performed by log2 transforming the peak areas and the calculating fold changes of inhibitor treat-ment compared to DMSO vehicle controls. If a DMSO peak area was missing or deviated by more than 4x the average peak area across the control replicates, the DMSO peak area for a different technical replicate was used to calculate the fold change (5-15% of peptides, depending on the dataset). Standard error (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and boxplot statistics were calculated for each drug treatment MRM, PRM, and DIA datasets. Significance between SE boxplots was determined using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test for data that does not fit normal distribution.  Significance of log2-fold change values was determined using the student’s one-tailed t-test when identifying proteins or peptides that are down-regulated in response to treatment (p < 0.05). To identify peptides that were differentially regulated (up or down), a two-tailed t-test was used. Forest plots show 95% confidence intervals for all peptides observed across MRM, PRM, and DIA that had a fold change of less than -2 and a p-value ≤ 0.05 in at least one MS quantification platform.",2017-03-15,"[[""PMID:29164889"",""DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00329""]]"

Tankyrases are implicated involving in multiple cellular functions, including the telomere length control, Wnt/b-catenin pathway regulation, glucose uptake and cell cycle regulation. Emerging evidences reveal the pathological relevance of tankyrase in diseases and propose these two key enzymes as potential drug targets. However, the cellular functions and regulatory machineries of tankyrases are still largely unknown. Through this proteomic analysis, we not only defined the protein-protein interaction map for the tankyrases which revealed 100~150 high confident interacting proteins for tankyrases in various cellular functions, but also uncovered the novel regulating function of tankyrase in peroxisome homeostasis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monomethylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""34""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","Human, Tankyrase, TAP, LC-MSMS","Peptide sequences (and hence protein identity) were determined by matching protein databases with the acquired fragmentation pattern by the software program, SEQUEST (ver. 28).

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method.

Briefly, the images were wrapped, and the protein spots were found, then the background was subtracted followed by matching and quantification (measuring the spot percentage). Accurate manual checking was performed all the time. Spot percentage was defined as the spot integrated density above background. The dysregulation was measured as the fold change of the spot percentages. Fold change for upregulation (spot % of BC divided by spot % of control) is shown with positive numbers and downregulation (spot % of Control sample divided by spot % of BC sample) is shown with negative numbers.

This stem-cell like character is important for cell therapies aiming at regeneration of specific immunity. Cell surface proteins are crucial for recognition and response to signals mediated by other cells or environmental changes. Knowledge of cell surface proteins of human naive CD4+ T cells and their changes during the early phase of T cell activation is urgently needed for a guided differentiation of naive T cells and may support the selection of  pluripotent cells for cell therapy.<br>Periodate oxidation and aniline-catalyzed oxime ligation (PAL) technology was applied with subsequent quantitative LC-MS/MS (PAL-qLC-MS/MS) to generate a dataset describing the surface proteome of human naive CD4+ T cells and to monitor dynamic changes during the early phase of activation. This led to the identification of 173 N-glycosylated surface proteins, of which 24 were previously not known to be expressed on human naive CD4+ T cells or have no defined role within T cell activation. To independently confirm the proteomic dataset and to analyse the cell surface by an alternative technique a systematic phenotypic expression analysis of surface antigens via flow cytometry was performed. This screening expanded the previous dataset, resulting in 229 surface proteins which are expressed on naive unstimulated and activated CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, we generated a surface expression atlas based on transcriptome data, experimental annotation and predicted subcellular localization, and correlated the proteomics result with this transcriptional dataset.<br>This extensive surface atlas provides an overall naive CD4+ T cell surface resource and will enable future studies aiming at a deeper understanding of mechanisms of T cell biology allowing the identification of novel immune targets usable for the development of therapeutic treatments.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap XL""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]",T-cells,"The LC-MS/MS analyses were performed as described previously (Merl, J. et al, Proteomics 2012, 12, 1902-1911; von Toerne, C. et al, Mol Cell Proteomics 2014, 13, 2371-2381) on a LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with the following adjustments: A nano trap column was used (300 μm inner diameter × 5 mm, packed with Acclaim PepMap100 C18. 5 μm, 100 Å; LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) before separation by reversed phase chromatography (PepMap, 25 cm, 75 µm ID, 2µm/100 Å pore size, LC Packings) operated on a RSLC (Ultimate 3000, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) using a nonlinear 170 min LC gradient from 5 to 31% of buffer B (98% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) at 300 nl/min flow rate followed by a short gradient from 31 to 95% buffer B in 5 min and an equilibration for 15 min to starting conditions.

PXD006589,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006589,Aging-related proteome alterations in B cells may predispose for chronic lymphocytic leukemia - nuclear proteins of CLL cells,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of leukemia in adults, is still incurable despite the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""L-histidine residue"",""UNIMOD"":""39#C""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, primary human B lymphocytes, shotgun proteomics, aging, glutaminolysis, fatty acid beta oxidation, Q Exactive orbitrap","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation.

Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses.

The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).

Manassantin A has been shown to possess potent hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) inhibitory activity in a cell-based assay screen of thousands of natural products.  Manassantin A holds promise as an anti-cancer drug since it has been shown to selectively target tumor cells over normal cells. Due to the complex biological pathways involved in cancer and hypoxia, it is difficult to determine the mode-of-action by which manassantin A inhibits HIF-1.  While some of the biological activities of manassantin A have been discovered in various cell-based activity assays, the molecular basis of manassantin A’s biological activities is not well characterized.  The proteins in a hypoxic MDA-MB-231 cell lysate were screened for interactions with manassantin A using large scale experiments to uncover novel manassantin A interactions that lead to the drug’s HIF-1 inhibition and anti-cancer activity. Two energetics-based approaches were utilized in this manassantin A mode-of-action study: iTRAQ-SPROX and SILAC-Pulse Proteolysis.  In these energetics-based approaches, protein stability is measured using the chemical denaturant dependence of either a methionine oxidation reaction (iTRAQ-SPROX) or a thermolysin protease digest (SILAC-Pulse Proteolysis).  Using boh of these techniques, the stability of proteins in the absence and presence of excess manassantin A was monitored to assess ligand-induced protein stability changes.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""L-methionine sulfone"",""UNIMOD"":""425#M""},{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide - site C""},{""ptm"":""6x(13)C,2x(15)N labeled L-lysine"",""UNIMOD"":""259""},{""ptm"":""6x(13)C,4x(15)N labeled L-arginine"",""UNIMOD"":""267""}]","[""6520 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]","[""SILAC""]","manassantin A, MDA-MB-231, pulse proteolysis, drug mode-of-action, Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino Acids in Cell culture, in-gel digestion","The LC-MS/MS data were searched on Spectrum Mill Workbench Software version A.03.03 against the SwissProt homo sapiens database with trypsin digestion including tryptic peptides with up to 3 missed cleavages.

PXD010690,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010690,Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid via data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the brain and serves as a valuable specimen to examine diseases of the central nervous system through analyzing its components. These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""brain""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]",,"proteomics, data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry, DIA, cerebrospinal fluid, CSF, spectral library","The generated .RAW files were directly analyzed by Proteome Discoverer (PD) 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

PXD009021,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009021,Proteomic Analysis of Human Liver Reference Material,"Recent advances in mass spectrometric (MS) instruments resulting in high mass resolution and high duty cycles have allowed of very deep coverage of proteomes. However, even with state of the art, high duty cycle instruments, the number of proteins identified with a conventional single liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC/MS/MS) analysis is typically limited and fractionating protein samples prior to LC/MS/MS analysis is crucial for increasing both the analytical dynamic range and proteome coverage.  In order to achieve near comprehensive identification of proteomes two-dimensional (2D) chromatography has been an invaluable tool.  This first dimension is typically performed with µL/min flow and relatively large column inner diameters, which allow efficient pre-fractionation but typically require peptide amounts in the milligram range while the second dimension is typically performed with nL/min flow rates and capillary columns with small inner diameters. Typically, reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) provides high peak resolution of peptides and achieves higher peak capacities than strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) due to the faster chromatographic partitioning. Another advantage of RPLC is that the mobile phases used generate much cleaner samples for downstream analyses, while the incorporation of a desalting step for SCX in order to eliminated the high salt concentrations that can significantly decrease the analytical sensitivity of the MS analysis due to ionization problems. When operated at widely different pH values (e.g., 1st dimension pH 10 and 2nd dimension pH 3) 2D RPLC-RPLC provides separation orthogonality comparable to that of the combination of SCX-RPLC. The difference of separation selectivity between the low and high pH (HpH) RPLC comes from the changes in the charge distribution within peptide chains upon altering pH of the eluent.  Herein we describe a method in which tryptic peptides are separated in the first dimension by HpH-RPLC and fractions are collected every 90 s over an 80 min gradient. For the second dimension, each of these fractions is individually run by the standard low pH RPLC method. The implementation of the HpH pre-fractionation allows for short second dimension gradients for bottom up LC/MS/MS and yields very deep (e.g. thousands of identifications) protein coverage at reasonable measurement time.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""liver""]","[{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Gln-\u003epyro-Glu"",""UNIMOD"":""28""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Technical"",""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, Liver","Resulting raw files were processed and searched with Proteome Discoverer (2.0.0.802) using Mascot, Sequest HT, and MSPepSearch algorithms.

Using chemical proteomics and a high-throughput ex vivo assay in a reconstructed tumor microenvironment (TME), we determined the molecular basis for ibrutinib activity and mechanism of acquired ibrutinib resistance.  Reciprocal activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR and integrin β1 signaling were identified as a signaling hub of kinome for ibrutinib resistance, resulting in enforced TME-lymphoma interactions, promoting mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) growth and drug resistance. Combinatorial disruption of BCR signaling and ibrutinib resistance associated pathways led to release of MCL cells from TME, reversal of drugresistance and enhanced anti-MCL activity in murine and patient-derived xenograft models.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, primary human B lymphocytes, shotgun proteomics, aging, glutaminolysis, fatty acid beta oxidation, Q Exactive orbitrap","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method.

PXD010708,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010708,Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid via data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the brain and serves as a valuable specimen to examine diseases of the central nervous system through analyzing its components. These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cerebrospinal fluid""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics"",""SWATH MS""]",,"proteomics, data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry, DIA, cerebrospinal fluid, CSF, spectral library","The generated .RAW files were directly analyzed by Proteome Discoverer (PD) 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) has emerged as the most suitable technology for global histone modification analysis due to the high sensitivity and the high mass accuracy that provide confident identification. However, the histone nanoLC-MS/MS data analysis is even more challenging due to the large number and variety of isobaric histone peptides, and the high dynamic range of histone peptide abundances. Here, we introduce EpiProfile, a software tool that discriminates isobaric histone peptides using the distinguishing fragment ions in their tandem mass spectra and extracts the chromatographic area under the curve using previous knowledge about peptide retention time. The accuracy of EpiProfile was evaluated by analysis of mixtures containing different ratios of synthetic histone peptides. In addition to label-free quantification of histone peptides, EpiProfile is flexible, and can quantify different types of isotopically labeled histone peptides. EpiProfile is much more convenient when compared to manual quantification, filling the need of an automatic and freely available tool to quantify labeled and non-labeled modified histone peptides. In summary, EpiProfile is a valuable nanoLC-MS/MS based quantification tool for histone modifications, which can also be adapted to analyze non-histone protein samples.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""formylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""122""},{""ptm"":""propanoylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""58""},{""ptm"":""butanoylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""36#K""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","histone, post-translational modification, proteomics, quantification, retention time, isobaric peptide","We developed the quantification program, named EpiProfile, for high-resolution mass spectra.

The extracted elution profile of the mono-isotopic mass for each given peptide is then selected. Three data types are extracted: RT, AUC, and full width at half maximum (FWHM). The final output contains both Excel tables and PDF figures.  The main challenges in quantifying histone peptides are determining the RTs of peptides and discriminating isobaric peptides. We modified EpiProfile to solve these problems. To accurately quantify histone peptides, we set the following parameters: xtract 1.0.0.2 in pFind Studio (pfind.ict.ac.cn) to generate peak lists, precursor mass tolerance ±10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance ±0.4 Da for CID, trypsin only cleaving after arginine and up to 2 miscleavages, Propionyl[Peptide N-term]/+56.026 as the fixed modification, Propionyl[K]/+56.026, Acetyl[K]/+42.011, Methyl_Propionyl[K]/+70.042, Dimethyl[K]/+28.031, Trimethyl[K]/+42.047, and Phospho[ST]/+79.966 as variable modifications. The quantification of histone peptides in EpiProfile consists of four steps: (1) extracting RT and AUC for the unmodified peptides; (2) locating RT for the modified peptides; (3) extracting RT and AUC for the modified peptides; (4) producing layouts and combining results.",2014-11-26,"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:25805797""]]"

The definite characterization of dietary cow’s milk proteins (CMP) that survive the maternal digestive tract to be absorbed into the bloodstream and secreted into breast milk remains missing. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of CMP-derived peptides in breast milk, using antibody-independent methods.  Using high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry in blinded assays, we identified 11 cow’s milk-derived peptides, including two β-lactoglobulin (2 out 6 samples) and one αs1-casein (1 out 6 samples) fragments, in breast milk from mothers receiving a cup of bovine milk daily. The β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) fragments, namely f42-54 and f42-57, were absent in milk from mothers who observed a strict dairy-free diet (6 samples). In contrast, neither intact nor hydrolyzed β-Lg was detected by Western blot or competitive ELISA tests.  CMP-derived peptides rather than intact CMP may sensitize or elicit allergic responses in the neonate through mother’s milk. Immunologically active peptides from the maternal diet could be involved in priming the newborn’s immune system to drive tolerogenic response in neonates and infants.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""deaminated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""dehydrated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"human, bovine, milk, peptides, LC-MS/MS",Data was exported to .mgf format and analyzed by the offline search engine X!Tandem.

PXD010252,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010252,Liver metastatic growth in colorectal cancer depends on PAD4 leading to modification of the extracellular matrix by citrullination,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequently occurring malignancies and a major cause of cancer death. Distant metastases in this disease most commonly develop in the liver and are often untreatable.  Here, we show that citrullination of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by cancer cell derived peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is essential for the growth of liver metastases.  Citrullination of proteins, a post-translational conversion of arginine residues to citrulline, is well recognized in rheumatoid arthritis, but largely undocumented in cancer. PAD4, a key enzyme responsible for catalyzing citrullination, is produced by metastatic colorectal cancer cells and found at higher levels in human liver metastases than in normal liver. Functional significance for citrullination in metastatic growth was evident in murine models where inhibition of citrullination, either globally by pharmacologic inhibition of PADs or specifically in colorectal cancer cells by PAD4 knockdown substantially reduced liver metastatic burden. Additionally, citrullination of a key ECM component collagen type I led to greater adhesion and decreased migration of colorectal cancer cells along with increased expression of characteristic epithelial markers, suggesting a role for citrullination in promoting mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and liver metastasis. Overall, our study revealed the potential for PAD4-dependant citrullination to drive the progression of liver metastasis. These data indicate that inhibition of citrullination could be exploited to prevent the development of liver metastases in colorectal cancer.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""liver""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","Liver, PAD4, Citrullination","Peak lists containing MS/MS spectra were generated using MSConvert (Proteome Wizard).

Imatinib mesylate has emerged as the leading compound to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), through its inhibition of Bcr- Abl tyrosine kinases, and other cancers. However, resistance to imatinib develops frequently, particularly in late-stage disease and has necessitated the development of new BCR-ABL inhibitors. The synthesis of a new series of phenylaminopyrimidines, structurally related to imatinib showed large interest since the introduction of the nilotibin. To identify the cellular pathways affected by new synthesized compounds, we applied mass spectrometry together with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for the comparative study of protein expression in K562 cells that were untreated or treated with imatinib and imatinib derivates. Further, the global proteome of the K562 cells treated with imatinib were quantitatively compared with the cells treated with the new compounds. This study enriched our knowledge about direct cellular targets of kinase selective drugs. Further the results offered important new knowledge for gaining insights into the structural effects of action of the new compounds.

To determine the histone layouts for new organisms, DDA and DIA can be both used, while DDA is for identification and DIA is for validation. DDA data can be searched against the histone database, with lots of variable modifications, e.g. acetylation (ac), mono-, di-, tri-methylation (me1, me2, and me3), phosphorylation (ph), crotonylation (cr), ubiquitination (ub), etc. A lot of search engines can be used. Two of them are recommended for histone identification, i.e. pFind and Mascot. pFind 3.0 is especially easy for histone identification, because both the MS2 and MS1 can be manually checked. In the DDA mode, some low-abundance peptides do not have the MS2 spectra. Even if the chromatographic peaks can be seen, we still do not have the MS/MS spectra. In contrast, DIA mode is a kind of validation. In the DIA mode, both the fragment ions and the chromatographic peaks can be seen. The retention time relationship of PTMs on the same peptide sequence (layout) is important. For example, ac (42.01 Da) and me3 (42.04 Da) are close in mass, but they are different in retention time (ac is later than me3). Isobaric peptides have the same mass, and in some case they co-elute. In this case the unique fragment ions in the MS2 spectra can be used to discriminate them. EpiProfile is developed to generate the layouts of PTMs on the same peptide sequence, discriminate the isobaric peptides, and then quantify the area under curve for each histone peptide.",2017-01-06,"[[""PMID:29790754"",""DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00133""]]"

We isolated PBMC and programmed the mononuclear cells to generate iPSCs. Subsequently, the PBMC-originated iPSCs were differentiated to CECs. The morphology of differentiating iPSCs was examined at regular intervals by phase contrast microscopy. In parallel, the expression of pluripotent, and CECs-associated markers was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The molecular architecture of the iPSCs-derived CECs and human corneal endothelium (CE) were examined by mass spectrometry-based proteome sequencing. The PBMC-originated iPSCs expressed pluripotent-specific markers at levels similar to expression in H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Phase contrast microscopy illustrated that iPSCs-derived CECs are tightly adherent, exhibiting a hexagonal-like shape, one of the cardinal characteristics of CECs. The CECs-associated markers were expressed at many orders of magnitude higher in iPSCs-derived CECs at days 13, 20, and 30 compared to their respective levels in iPSCs. Importantly, only residual expression levels of pluripotency markers were detected in iPSCs-derived CECs. Mass spectrometry-based proteome profiling identified 10,575 proteins in iPSCs-derived CECs. In parallel, we completed proteome profiling of the human CE identifying 6345 proteins. Of these, 5763 proteins were identified in the iPSCs-derived CECs suggesting a 90.82% overlap between the iPSCs-derived CECs and human CE proteomes. Importantly, cryopreservation of iPSCs-derived CECs did not affect the tight adherence of CECs, and their hexagonal-like shape while expressing high levels of CECs-associated markers.

Cells sense force  between themselves and their microenvironment controlling the capability of MSCs to differentiate into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. Force sensing is transmitted by integrin receptors and their associated adhesion signalling complexes. To identify regulators of MSC force sensing we sought to catalogue MSC adhesion complex composition. Therefore we isolated integrin-associated adhesion complexes formed in MSCs plated on the ECM ligand fibronectin.  We identifed proteins using mass spectrometry that define a MSC specific subset of adhesion complex proteins consisting of key linkages to the actin cytoskeleton together with integrin signalling and force sensing components.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Velos"",""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","MSC, Integrin, focal adhesions, Extracellular matrix, cell adhesion","MS/MS spectra were processed with Mascot-Daemon (version 2.4) (Matrix Science, London, UK).

As such, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) suppress the aggregation of polyQ-expanded huntingtin (HTT), the mutant protein underlying Huntington’s disease (HD). Here we show that proteasome activity determines HTT levels, preventing the accumulation of polyQ-expanded aggregates in iPSCs from HD patients (HD-iPSCs). iPSCs exhibit intrinsic high levels of UBR5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that we find required for proteasomal degradation of both normal and mutant HTT. When UBR5 fails to monitor HTT proteostasis, the concomitant up-regulation of HTT expression particularly results in polyQ-expanded aggregation in HD-iPSCs. Moreover, UBR5 knockdown hastens protein aggregation and neurotoxicity in polyQ-expanded invertebrate models. Notably, ectopic expression of UBR5 is sufficient to induce polyubiquitination and degradation of mutant HTT, reducing polyQ-expanded aggregates in HD cell models. However, UBR5 is dispensable for the proteostasis of other aggregation-prone proteins linked with Machado-Joseph disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in iPSCs. Besides its role in HTT regulation, we find that intrinsic high levels of UBR5 also determine the global proteostatic ability of iPSCs preventing aggresome formation, suggesting a role in the control of misfolded proteins ensued from normal metabolism. Thus, our findings indicate UBR5 as a central component of super-vigilant proteostasis of iPSCs with the potential to correct proteostatic deficiencies in HD.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""ubiquitination signature dipeptidyl lysine"",""UNIMOD"":""121#K""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human cells (293), HTT","All mass spectrometric raw data were processed with Maxquant (version 1.5.3.8) using default parameters81.

PXD009801,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009801,The nature and extent of contributions by defective ribosome products to the HLA peptidome,"MHC class I peptides are products of endogenous cellular protein degradation. Their prompt presentation, after rapid degradation of their newly synthesized source proteins, is needed to alert the immune system during pathogen infection. A possible source for such rapidly degrading proteins can be defective ribosome products (DRiPs), which include polypeptides produced as part of the pioneer round of translation, premature translation termination, and proteins failing to fold properly or to assemble into their multisubunit protein complexes. However, the identities and relative contribution to the MHC peptidome of these mature or newly synthesized and rapidly degraded cellular proteins is not well understood. To clarify these issues, we used dynamic stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture to define the relative rates of synthesis of the HLA class I peptidomes and the source proteomes of three cultured human hematopoietic cell lines. Large numbers of HLA class I peptides were observed to be derived from DRiPs, defined here as HLA peptides that shift from their light to heavy isotope forms, faster than their source proteins. Specific groups of proteins, such as ribosomal and T-complex protein 1 (TCP-1), contributed a disproportionately large number of DRiPs to the HLA peptidomes. Furthermore, no significant preference was observed for HLA peptides derived from the amino terminal regions of the proteins, suggesting that the contribution of products of premature translation termination was minimal. Thus, the most likely sources of DRiPs-derived HLA peptides are full-sized, misassembled, and surplus subunits of large protein complexes.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap"",""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","DRiPome, immunopeptidome, dynamic SILAC","Data Analysis.

Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. Known mechanisms for EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification did not observe in the resistant cells, PC9/gef. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs in PC9/gef cells. Here, we used label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to globally profile the basal phosphoproteome and proteome of a panel of TKI sensitive PC9, TKI resistant PC9/gef and TKI dose-dependent PC9/gef NSCLC cell lines. For phosphorylation level, we identified 5844 phosphorylation sites from 4612 phosphopeptides of 1548 proteins. For protein level, we identified 3835 proteins. Most of the quantitatively change is from phosphorylation whereas most of the protein level is unchanged. Among these big datasets, there is a phosphopattern of phosphopeptides presented up-regulated in resistant cells but no response to further gefitinib treatment; we proposed this group could regulate drug resistance. By motif analysis, these phosphopeptides mapped to the corresponding kinases, CK2, as the drug resistant kinase. Network analysis showed that CK2 directed interacting with 10 proteins. Among these proteins, we found that HMGA1 is the substrate protein to CK2. By biochemical evidence, we discovered that CK2 could regulate cell death in TKI-resistant cells. Furthermore, we found that HMGA1 for the first time could be the potential drug resistant target to reverse the drug resistance in PC9/gef cells.

Immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis the most common form of amyloidosis can appear as a local disorder presented with mild symptoms or as a life threatening systemic disease. Identification of the proteins forming amyloid fibrils is essential for the diagnosis of the disease and knowledge about the overall protein composition of the deposits may lead to a larger understanding of the deposition events thereby facilitating a more detailed picture of the molecular pathology.  In this study, we investigated the protein composition of AL amyloid deposits isolated from human eyelid, conjunctival and orbital specimens.

Proteins in the captured amyloid and control samples were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and subsequently quantified using the label-free mass spectrometry quantification method exponential modified Protein Abundance Index.   Immunoglobulin light chain kappa or lambda was revealed to be the most predominant protein in the amyloid deposits. In addition, the protein profiles identified apolipoprotein E and serum amyloid P component to be associated with the immunoglobulin light chain deposits across all three tissues analyzed.

RNA-binding proteins play central roles in RNA regulation, including translation and turnover. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 is highly expressed in hESCs to maintain their undifferentiated state and prevent default neural fate. Notably, loss of CSDE1 accelerates neural differentiation and potentiates neurogenesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of CSDE1 impairs neural differentiation. We find that CSDE1 post-transcriptionally modulates core components of multiple regulatory nodes of hESC identity, neuroectoderm commitment and neurogenesis. Among these key pro-neural/neuronal factors, CSDE1 binds fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) and vimentin (VIM) mRNAs as well as transcripts involved in neuron projection development regulating their stability and translation. Thus, our results uncover CSDE1 as a central post-transcriptional regulator of hESC identity and neurogenesis.

A particularly marked reduction of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) raises the possibility of using changes in levels of this glycoprotein as a marker of abnormal tissue, as previously suggested in horse models. Surprisingly, and despite using an elastase digestion for validation, elastin was not detected, raising the possibility that it is not highly abundant in human supraspinatus tendon. Finally, we identified marked changes to the elastic fibre, fibrillin-rich niche and the pericellular matrix. Further investigation of these regions may yield other potential biomarkers and help to explain detrimental cellular processes associated with tendon ageing and tendinopathy.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""tendon""]","[{""ptm"":""Lys-\u003eAllysine"",""UNIMOD"":""352""},{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","Human, Supraspinatus, Label-Free","All mass spectra of label-free samples were extracted by Progenesis LC-MS, and then analysed by Mascot (Matrix Science), which was set up to search against all human Swiss Prot database entries with the following parameters: Trypsin or no enzyme search for trypsin and elastase samples, respectively; fixed modification: carbamidomethylation (cysteine), variable modifications: Oxidation (proline, lysine) and allysine (lysine).

Serum samples were trypsin-digested and fractionated by SCX chromatography prior to SRM and PRM measurements. PRM data obtained by high-resolution mass spectrometry correlated better with ELISA measurements than SRM data measured on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. While all three methods (SRM, PRM, ELISA) were able to quantify HSP90 alpha in serum at the ng/mL level, the use of PRM on a high-resolution mass spectrometer reduced variation. To rule out that the observed differences in SRM and PRM are due to different mass spectrometry systems, the SCX fractions were measured on the same high-resolution instrument (Orbitrap) in the ion trap mode (IT-PRM); such measurements showed that intense co-eluting signals were present in the SRM method, but these interfering peaks were eliminated in the high-resolution PRM mode. Thus, this report shows that it is possible to measure ng/mL levels of HSP90 alpha in a reproducible, selective and sensitive way using PRM.

However, how EZH2 drives metastasis despite the low H3K27me3 levels observed in ER- breast cancer is unknown.

Functional bioinformatic analysis revealed that they were mostly related to the cytoskeleton, transcription, signal transduction, and cell cycle. Fuzzy c-means clustering identified six temporal profiles of phosphorylation and a functional module composed of ATM-phosphorylated proteins related to genotoxic stress.

PXD000682,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000682,Transcriptomic and Proteomic Response of HC-04 to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),"The routine study of human malaria liver-stage biology in vitro is hampered by low infection efficiency of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lines (<0.1%), poor understanding of steady-state HCC biology, and lack of appropriate tools for trace sample analysis. HC-04 is the only HCC that supports complete development of human malaria parasites. We hypothesized that HCCs are in various intermediate stages of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and HC-04s retain epithelial characteristics that permit infection. We developed an novel analytical approach to test this hypothesis viz. the HC-04 response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We used online two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) to quantify protein expression profiles in HC-04 pre-/post-HGF treatment and validated these results by RT-qPCR and microscopy. We successfully increased protein identification efficiency over offline-2D methods by 12-fold using less sample material, allowing robust protein quantification. We observed expected up-regulation and down-regulation of EMT protein markers in response to HGF, but also unexpected cellular responses. HC-04 is thus susceptible to HGF-mediated signaling but to a lesser degree than what we observed for HepG2, a widely used, but poor malaria HCC model.  Our analytical approach to understanding the basic biology of HC-04 helps us understand the factors that may influence its utility as a model for malaria liver-stage development. We observed that HC-04 treatment with HGF prior to the addition of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites did not facilitate cell invasion, arguing for unlinking the effect of HGF on malaria liver stage development from hepatocyte invasion. Finally, our 2D-LC-MS/MS approach and broadly applicable experimental strategy should prove useful in the analysis of various hepatocyte-pathogen interactions, tumor progression and early disease events.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""6520 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS""]","[""Highlighted"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","Human Hepatocellular carcinoma, EMT, Malaria, Host-Pathogen Interaction, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Mass Spectrometry","All the LC-MS/MS raw data were converted to Mascot generic Format (.mgf) by Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis B.04.00.

It is highly unlikely that specific antibodies, covering the more than hundred thousands of estimated phosphosites in human cells, will become available soon. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches are becoming of interest, as these are able to monitor at least thousands of sites simultaneously. However, it has become apparent that important signaling nodes, detectable by phosphosite specific-antibodies are quite often not observed in these large-scale in-depth MS-based studies. Here we addressed this issue by using multiple proteases for protein digestion, thereby increasing the size of the accessible and detectable phosphoproteome. We demonstrate that nearly each phosphosite has a preferred protease which favors detection by MS. For specific sites the use of alternative proteases increases the intensity by more than 1,000 fold.

The SCS for a given phosphorylation site was calculated as follows: (1) the amount of PSMs of that phosphosite in a given protease data set was divided by total spectral counts obtained by that protease, then (2) the obtained value was normalized to 100% on the sum of the five values obtained from each protease. For label-free analysis, raw data were processed with MaxQuant version 1.3.0.5 (Cox and Mann, 2008). The database search was performed in Andromeda search engine with the following parameters: an initial mass tolerance of ±20 ppm and a final mass tolerance of ±6 ppm for precursor masses, ±0.6 Da for CID and ETD ion trap fragment ions, allowing two missed cleavages for trypsin, three for LysC and chymotrypsin, five for GluC and AspN. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was used as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation, protein N‐terminal acetylation and serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation as variable modifications. The false discovery rate was set to 1% for peptides, proteins and phosphosites, the minimum peptide length allowed was six amino acids and a minimum Andromeda peptide score of 60 was required. The match between runs feature was enabled. A site localization probability of at least 0.75 and a score difference of at least 5 were used as threshold for the localization of phosphorylated residues.",2015-03-27,"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.celrep.2015.05.029"",""PMID:26074081""]]"

In cells lacking Rab18, LDs were modestly reduced in size and numbers, but we found little evidence for Rab18 function in LD formation, LD turnover upon cell starvation, or the targeting of several proteins to LDs.

PXD007790,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007790,NAD Salvage Supports Serine Biosynthesis,"Maintenance of NAD+ levels by mitochondrial complex I, the NAD+ salvage pathway, and other routes is an important factor in of neurodegenerative disease and cancer. Both the production of NAD+ and the metabolic enzymes that require it as a redox cofactor or substrate differ widely in abundance across cell types and conditions. Disruption in the NAD+ supply thus exerts different effects depending on the cellular NAD+ requirements existing in the cell. Pharmacological depletion of NAD+ is actively being pursued in cancer and other diseases but these effects are not fully understood. Here, we combine quantitative proteomics and metabolomics to understand the consequences of disrupting cellular NAD+ levels and find that inhibiting the NAD+ salvage pathway depletes serine biosynthesis from glucose by impeding the NAD+-dependent protein 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). Importantly, breast cancers that depend on PHGDH are exquisitely sensitive to blocking the NAD+ salvage pathway. PHGDH, and the rate-limiting enzyme of NAD+ salvage are also correlated in public tumor proteome and transcript datasets. These findings are immediately translatable to the pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT in PHGDH-dependent cancers.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex"",""UNIMOD"":""737""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","Serine, Complex I, NAD, FK866","Mass spectrometry data files were converted to mzXML using a modified version of ReadW.exe.

Quantity was estimated in absolute amounts using the Hi 3 method32, 41.

Information contained in ion accounting files were collated into a single .csv document using a custom Python script.  Data filtering and normalisation Protein identifications collated from the ion accounting files were further quality filtered by allowing only identifications with the following criteria: identification in at least two separate samples (not including replicate injections), a process that required at least three high quality unmodified peptides using the Hi3 method, and 2 peptides with at least 4 fragment ions for each protein.  All other protein identities were removed.  Proteins were first ranked according to coverage across the samples, and then each protein entry was ranked according to the order in which they were run.

Replicate injections were inspected for consistency in quantitation. To achieve this, an average of the two injections ‘top 3 peptide intensity sum’ was used and a distance matrix calculated by taking the Euclidian distance between the two injections as a function of the average of the injections. These values were visualised in a heat map, enabling rapid inspection of duplicates with high variance, which likely indicated a technical issue between injections (e.g. sprayer dropout, or failure to inject the correct volume).  In order to uniformly remove suspect injections from the dataset, we created the following universal rule: for samples with >2-fold between-injection difference in average intensity of proteins, the following rule (Rule 1) was applied: “report injection one intensity values for proteins, unless protein was only quantified in injection two, then include this value for increasing coverage”.",2017-02-22,"[[""DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00018"",""PMID:29737851""]]"
PXD009481,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009481,Human Cdc14A is phosphorylated by Cdk1 at early mitosis,"Cdc14 enzymes compose a family of highly conserved phosphatases that are present in a wide range of organisms, including yeast and humans, and that preferentially reverse the phosphorylation of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (Cdk) substrates. The budding yeast Cdc14 orthologue has essential functions in the control of late mitosis and cytokinesis. In mammals, however, the two Cdc14 homologues, Cdc14A and Cdc14B, do not play a prominent role in controlling late mitotic events, suggesting that some Cdc14 functions are not conserved across species. Moreover, in yeast, Cdc14 is regulated by changes in its subcellular location and by phosphorylation events. In contrast, little is known about the regulation of human Cdc14 phosphatases. Here, we have studied how the human Cdc14A orthologue is regulated during the cell cycle. We found that Cdc14A is phosphorylated on Ser411, Ser453 and Ser549 by Cdk1 early in mitosis and becomes dephosphorylated during late mitotic stages. Interestingly, in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that, unlike in yeast, Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of human Cdc14A did not control its catalytic activity but likely modulated its interaction with other proteins in early mitosis. These findings point to differences in Cdk1-mediated mechanisms of regulation between human and yeast Cdc14 orthologues.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Cell cycle, Phosphatase, Phosphorylation, Molecular biology, Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), Cdc14.","Protein identification was done using Sequest algorithm and Homo sapiens RefSeq database release January 2014 from NCBI including common contaminant sequences.

This study aims to tackle this dilemma using large-scale immunopeptidome analyses. First, cultured cells (MCF-7) were treated with interferons, which dramatically increased presentation levels of their HLA-B molecules, much more than HLA-A and HLA-C. The differential increase in the HLA-B molecules with their bound peptides, was driven by elevated HLA synthesis levels and not by supply of peptides, since all three HLA allotypes draw peptides from the same peptide pool, which should have been affected similarly by the interferons treatment. In addition, artificial competition for peptides was created by recombinant high levels expression of soluble HLA-A*02:01 molecules, in the same MCF-7 cells and on top of their endogenous membranal HLA-A*02:01. This high level expression of the soluble HLA did not affect the endogenous membranal HLA-A*02:01 peptidomes or its cell surface presentation levels. We therefore concluded that a surplus supply of peptides is available for loading and that presentation levels are more likely limited by the supply of HLA molecules.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap"",""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]","[""Label free""]","HLA, Interferon, MHC, Peptidome, Immunopeptidome","The MS data was analyzed by the MaxQuant computational proteomics platform version 1.5.2.8for all of the analysis, except for the HLA-A2 peptidomics that was analyzed using the version 1.5.8.3.

Drug-stressed tumor cells secrete components that promote the survival of recipient cells and repopulation of damaged tumors. We have previously found that therapy-induced secretomes are enriched with spliceosomal proteins. The behavior of splicing-associated genes in response to chemotherapeutic drugs is poorly understood. We show that a severely stressed cell dramatically down-regulates spliceosomal proteins by secreting them into the extracellular space, reducing the expression of the respective genes, and disrupting the splicing. Our meta-analysis indicates that drugs with different action mechanisms cause a correlated decrease in the transcription of genes involved in spliceosome and mitotic cell cycle pathways and induce similar intron retention patterns in these genes. The key transcription factors regulating the concerted change in transcription are MYC, E2F1, TP53, and WT1. Based on the correlation analysis with siRNA data, we conclude that a decrease in the representation of intracellular spliceosomal proteins in response to stress is aimed at the cell cycle arrest. At the expression and processing levels, we demonstrate that a strong interplay between splicing-associated and cell cycle genes develops in stressed cancer cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Dehydrated"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","Chemotherapy, DNA damage response, Spliceosome","Raw LC-MS/MS data were converted to .mgf peaklists with the ProteinPilot (version 4.5).

Our current, albeit poor, understanding of Kupffer cell-pathogen interactions has been largely achieved through the study of primary cells, requiring isolation from a large numbers of animals. To facilitate the study of Kupffer cell biology, an immortalized rat Kupffer cell line, RKC1, was developed. We performed a comparative global proteomic analysis of RKC1 and primary rat Kupffer cells (PRKC) to characterize their respective responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated immune stimulation. We identified patent differences in the proteomic response profile of RKC1 and PRKC to LPS. We observed that PRKC upregulated more immune function pathways and exhibited marked changes in cellular morphology following stimulation. We consequently analyzed the cytoskeletal signaling pathways of these cells in light of the fact that macrophages are known to induce cytoskeletal changes in response to pathogens. Our findings suggest that Kupffer cells respond differently to inflammatory stimulus than do monocyte-derived macrophages, and such data may provide insight into how pathogens, such as the malaria parasite, may have evolved mechanisms of liver entry through Kupffer cells without detection.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""6520 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]",Cytoskeleton; Kupffer cell; Macrophage; Malaria; Murine,"All the LC-MS/MS raw data were converted to Mascot generic format (.mgf) by Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis B.04.00.

PXD009437,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009437,Human intestine LC-MSMS -  Transcriptional and proteomic analysis revealed a synergistic effect of aflatoxin M1 and ochratoxin A mycotoxins on intestinal epithelial integrity of differentiated human Caco-2 cells,"Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is a common mycotoxin in dairy milk and it is typically concurrently present with other mycotoxins that may represent a threat for food safety. However, knowledge on how AFM1, alone or in combination with other mycotoxins may affect human intestinal epithelial integrity remain to be established. We employed transcriptome and proteome analysis integrated with biological validation to reveal the molecular basis underlining the effect AFM1 and/or ochratoxin A (OTA) exposure on intestinal epithelial integrity of differentiated Caco-2 cells. Exposure to 4 μg/ml of OTA was found to disrupt human gut epithelial integrity, whereas 4 μg/ml of AFM1 did not. Integrated transcriptome and proteome analysis of AFM1 and OTA, alone or in combination, indicate synergistic effect of the two mycotoxins in disrupting intestinal integrity. This effect was mechanistically linked to a broad ranges of pathways related to intestinal integrity enriched by down-regulated genes and proteins, associated to focal adhesion, adherens junction, and gap junction pathways. Furthermore, the cross–omics analysis of mixed AFM1 and OTA compared with OTA alone suggest that kinases family members, including MLCK, MAPKs, and PKC are the potential key regulators on modulating intestinal epithelial integrity. These findings provide novel insight into the synergistic detrimental role of multiple mycotoxins in disrupting intestinal integrity, and, therefore, identify potential target to improve milk safety related to human health.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""deaminated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""iTRAQ4plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""iTRAQ""]","Human, intestinal epithelial cells, LC-MSMS","The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode and switch automatically between MS and MS/MS acquisition.

The integrity of the mitral valve is also essential for the maintenance of normal LV size, geometry, and function. Significant advances in the comprehension of the biological, functional, and mechanical behavior of the mitral valve have recently been made. However, current knowledge of protein components in the normal human mitral valve is still limited and complicated by the low cellularity of this tissue and the presence of high abundant proteins from the extracellular matrix. We employed here an integrated proteomic approach to analyse the protein composition of the normal human mitral valve and reported confident identification of 422 proteins, some of which have not been previously described in this tissue. In particular, we described the ability of pre-MS separation technique based on liquid-phase IEF and SDS-PAGE to identify the largest number of proteins.

After stimulation of Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, syndromatic platelets show a reduced phosphatidylserine exposure and do not form membrane blebs. Given the central role of anoctamin-6 in the platelet procoagulant response, we used quantitative proteomics to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and the complex phenotypic changes in Scott platelets compared to control platelets. Therefore, we applied an iTRAQ-based multi-pronged strategy to quantify changes in (i) the global proteome, (ii) the phosphoproteome and (iii) proteolytic events between resting and stimulated Scott and control platelets.  Our data indicate a limited number of proteins with decreased (70) or increased (64) expression in Scott platelets, among those we observed the absence of anoctamin-6 and the strong up-regulation of aquaporin-1. Furthermore, the quantification of 1,566 phosphopeptides revealed major differences between Scott and control platelets after stimulation with thrombin/convulxin or ionomycin. Finally, we quantified 1,596 N-terminal peptides in activated Scott and control platelets, 180 of which we identified as calpain-regulated, whereas a distinct set of 23 neo-N-termini was caspase-regulated. In Scott platelets, calpain-induced cleavage of cytoskeleton-linked and signaling proteins was down-regulated, in accordance with an increased phosphorylation state. Thus, multi-pronged proteomic profiling of Scott platelets provides detailed insight into their protection against detrimental Ca2+-dependent changes that are normally associated with phosphatidylserine exposure.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood platelet""]","[{""ptm"":""Glu-\u003epyro-Glu"",""UNIMOD"":""27""},{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Ammonia-loss"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Gln-\u003epyro-Glu"",""UNIMOD"":""28""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","Human platelets, proteome, phosphoproteome, N-terminal ChaFRADIC, LC-MS","iTRAQ global proteome and phosphoproteome data were interpreted as follows. Raw data were processed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 and 1.3 respectively (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Thus, data were searched against the Uniprot human database, Mascot and Sequest were used as search algorithms with the following settings: (i) trypsin as enzyme allowing two missed cleavages, (ii) iTRAQ 8-plex at N-termini and lysines and carbamidomethylation of Cys residues as fixed modifications, (iii) oxidation of methionine as variable modification, (iv) mass tolerances for MS and MS/MS were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. False discovery rate (FDR) estimation on the level of peptide spectrum matches was performed using the peptide validator node with filtering for 1% FDR (high confidence filter). The reporter ion quantifier node was used for iTRAQ reporter quantification. For the phosphoproteome analysis, phosphorylation of Ser/Thr/Tyr (+79.9663 Da) was set as variable modification furthermore, for localization of phosphorylated sites phospho-RS was used.For the global proteome only unique proteins quantified with at least 2 unique peptides were considered. Next, normalization factors were determinate and used to compensate for individual systematic errors (i.e. unequal sample amounts derived from pipetting errors or inaccurate BCA results) and to obtain normalized ratios. In addition, all data was scaled to obtain normalized abundance per iTRAQ channel. For the phosphoproteome, the obtained normalization factors from the global proteome were used to normalize the data and it was as well scaled to obtain normalized abundances. Furthermore, only phosphopeptides with phospho-RS probabilities >90% were considered as confident. Thus, for determination of confident phosphorylation sites at the peptide and protein level a ready-to-use Excel macro provided by Mechtler lab (http://ms.imp.ac.at/?goto=phosphors) was used. Additionally, label free quantification was performed using the Progenesis LC-MS software version 4.1 from Nonlinear Dynamics in combination with SearchGUI 2.8.1 and PeptideShaker 1.19.2.The following search parameters were used: (i) trypsin as protease with a maximum of two missed cleavages, (ii) carbamidomethylation of Cys as fixed, and (iii) oxidation of Met as variable modification. MS and MS/MS tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da. For all proteins, ratios between Scott and control platelets were calculated based on normalized areas obtained from Progenesis and log2-transformed. Regulations factors in both cases were as 2x SD of the normal distributed data. Finally, generated raw data from ChaFRADIC were searched against the human Uniprot database using Proteome Discoverer version 1.4 and Mascot 2.4 as search engine, reporter ion quantifier and percolator nodes. Enzyme specificities were set to semi-Arg-C, as Lys residues were blocked by iTRAQ labeling. To enable the quantification of two classes of N-terminal peptides, i.e. those with N-terminal iTRAQ label and those with endogenous N-acetylation, a two-step search strategy was performed. First, data were searched with iTRAQ-8plex (+304.2053 Da) as fixed modification at Lys and peptide N-termini; second, iTRAQ 8plex of Lys and N-terminal acetylation (+ 42.0105 Da) of N-termini were set as fixed modifications. In both cases, carbamidomethylation of Cys (+57.0214 Da) was selected as fixed and oxidation (+15.9949 Da) of methionine as variable modification. Mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm for MS and 0.02 Da for MS/MS. Identified peptides were filtered for high confidence corresponding to an FDR <1% at the PSM level, and a search engine rank of 1. The reporter ion quantifier node was adjusted according to the search settings. Quantification of N-terminal peptides across samples and conditions were essentially done as described for the phosphoproteome data. Sample set 2 was used to validate potential Calpain substrates. Therefore, the following ratios were determined: (i) ionomycin / unstimulated (ion effect); (ii) ionomycin+calpeptin / unstimulated (effect calpain inhibition); (iii) ionomycin+QVD-OPh / unstimulated (effect caspase inhibition)., (iv) ABT737 / unstimulated (ABT effect), (v)  ABT737+QVD-OPh / unstimulated (effect caspase inhibition), (vi) ABT737+calpeptin/ unstimulated (effect calpain inhibition).

ERMs can spontaneously localize in the ER of living cells and selectively label ER-associated proteins with a combined affinity and imaging tag, enabling tag-mediated ER protein enrichment and identification with liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The ERM probes could be used simultaneously with the nucleus- and mitochondria-localizable reactive molecules previously developed by our group, which enabled orthogonal organellar chemoproteomics in a single biological sample. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes in ER-associated proteins in response to tunicamycin-induced ER stress was performed by combining ER-specific labeling with SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based quantitative MS technology.

False discovery rates (FDRs) of identification were calculated using a reversed sequence decoy database: Protein FDR = (#reverse proteins identified)/(total protein identifications) × 100 and Peptide FDR = 2 × (#reverse peptide identifications)/(total peptide identifications) × 100 (Krijgsveld et al., 2006; Mirzaei et al., 2014). We used normalized spectral abundance factors (NSAF) as previously described by Zybailov et al. (2007) to estimate protein abundance data(Zybailov et al., 2007) For each protein k in sample i, the number of spectral counts that identified the protein were divided by the estimated protein length. The protein length was determined by dividing the molecular weight of the protein by the average amino acid molecular weight. SpCk/Length values were normalized to the total by dividing by the sum (SpCk/Lengthk) over all proteins, which yielded NSAFi values for each sample i. When plotting or summarizing the overall protein abundance for a particular condition, we use the average of the NSAF values for all replicates as a measure of protein abundance. A spectral fraction of 0.5 was initially added to all spectral counts to compensate for null values and allow for log transformation of the NSAF data prior to statistical analysis(Mirzaei et al., 2012).  Student t-tests on log-transformed NSAF data were used to determine differentially accumulated proteins. Only proteins present in all three replicates for at least one condition were included in the final data set. Proteins with t-test p-values <0.05 were considered to be significantly changed between the two conditions. Additionally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed to identify proteins that changed in abundance among those proteins present and reproducible under all conditions. The analysis was performed on log-transformed NSAF data and proteins with an ANOVA p-value <0.05 were considered to show a significant change between the different experimental conditions.",2017-09-26,"[[""PMID:29848781"",""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra118.000809""]]"
PXD001225,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001225,Novel surface functionalized superparamagnetic nanoparticles with engineered cellular uptake as a means for intracellular omics,"Superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPMNPs) are appealing for use in organelle isolation strategies. Yet, this potential remains largely unexplored because thus far research has focused on either physicochemical design or on their application in micron-sized beads. For their use in life sciences, the biocompatibility of SPMNPs goes beyond their chemical composition and shape, and features like their size and more importantly their surface properties are becoming more important to exploit extra- and intracellular interactions. Here we introduce thermal decomposition to manufacture iron oxide based SPMNPs (Ø10nm) and demonstrate how different surface functionalizations can lead to different types of cellular interactions.  Cationic aminolipid-coated SPMNPs reside surprisingly strong at the outer cell surface. In contrast, anionic dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated SPMNPs are efficiently internalized and accumulate in a time-dependent manner in endosomal and lysosomal populations. These features allowed us to establish a standardized magnetic isolation procedure to selectively isolate plasma membranes and intracellular late endosomes/lysosomes with high yields and purities as consolidated by biochemical and ultrastructural analyses. Subsequent quantitative and qualitative proteome analysis underpins the overall high enrichment for hydrophobic (membrane) proteins as well as plasma membrane and lysosomal constituents in the respective purified fractions. This nano based technology provides therefore a breakthrough in the field of subcellular ‘omics’ as it allows the identification of subtle alterations in the biomolecular composition of different SPMNP-isolated compartments that would be otherwise not detected in total cell or tissue analysis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""deaminated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"",""UNIMOD"":""24#C""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Technical"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","HeLa cells, Superparamagnetic nanoparticles, Subcellular organelles, Proteomics","From the MS/MS data in each LC-MS/MS run, Mascot Generic Files were created using the Mascot Distiller software (version 2.4.3.3, Matrix Science, www.matrixscience.com/Distiller).

The DNA methylation process generates S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, a strong inhibitor of DNMT1. Here we report that S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH/AHCY), the only mammalian enzyme capable of hydrolyzing S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine binds to DNMT1 during DNA replication. SAHH activates DNMT1 in vitro and its overexpression in mammalian cells leads to hypermethylation of the genome, whereas its inhibition by adenosine periodate resulted in hypomethylation of the genome. Hypermethylation was consistent in both gene bodies and repetitive DNA elements leading to both down- and up-regulation of genes. Similarly, hypomethylation led to both up- and down-regulation of genes suggesting methylated regions influence gene expression either positively or negatively. Cells overexpressing SAHH specifically up-regulated metabolic pathway genes and down-regulated PPAR and MAPK signaling pathways genes. Therefore, we suggest that alteration of SAHH level in the cell leads to aberrant DNA methylation, altered metabolite levels and gene expression.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","DNMT1, SAHH, Cell cycle",Data analysis Data analysis was performed with Proteome Discoverer 2.0 against uniprot_human_up000005640.fasta database complemented with streptavidin sequence and sequences of common contaminants.

Using a filter-aided sample preparation protocol modified for ancient samples we applied shotgun proteomics to seven samples of mummified lung, chest and pleura tissues. However, we only identified four peptides with unique matches to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, none of which were unique to M. tuberculosis, although we did identify a range of human proteins and non-mycobacterial bacterial proteins. In light of these limited results, we question the validity of the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) approach presented by Boros-Major et al.

We explore the challenges of using proteomic approaches to detect M. tuberculosis, and propose that, given the contentious outcomes that have plagued ancient protein research in the past, the susceptibility of ancient material to modern contamination, and the degradation inherent in archaeological materials, caution is needed in the acquisition, analysis and reporting of proteomic data from such material.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lung"",""thorax""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Gln-\u003epyro-Glu"",""UNIMOD"":""28""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""maXis""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, Mummified Tissue, LC-MS/MS, Tuberculosis","MS/MS spectra were converted to searchable Mascot generic format using Proteowizard version 3.0.6839 using the 200 most intense peaks in each MS/MS spectrum.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method.

PXD009754,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009754,LC-MSMS of the lc4 MHC class I immunopeptidome,"MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lung""]","[{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, lung cancer primary sample, LC-MSMS, MHC class I, immunopeptidome","Peptides were identified using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solution Inc.) and peptide sequences were searched against the lc4 global cancer database that was built using lc4 RNA-sequencing data (reference genome used: GRCh38.88, total number of proteins in database: 1,625,816).

FGE mutations leading to MSD affect the intracellular protein stability that determines residual enzyme activity and defines disease severity in MSD patients. Here, we show that Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) plays a pivotal role in the recognition and quality control of MSD-causing FGE variants. Overexpression of PDI reduces the residual activity of unstable FGE variants, whereas inhibition of PDI function rescues the residual activity of sulfatases in MSD fibroblasts. Analysing a covalent complex consisting of PDI and a FGE variant by LC-MALDI mass spectrometry allowed to determine the molecular signature for FGE recognition by PDI.

However, the contribution of MSC in brain cancer is not well understood since either oncogenic or tumor suppressor effects have been reported for these cells. Here, MSC were found capable of stimulating human Glioblastoma (GBM) cell proliferation through a paracrine effect mediated by TGFB1. Moreover, when in direct cell-cell contact with GBM cells, MSC elicited an increased proliferative and invasive tumor cell behavior under 3D conditions, as well as accelerated tumor development in nude mice, independently of paracrine TGFB1. A secretome profiling of MSC-GBM co-cultures identified 126 differentially expressed proteins and 10 proteins exclusively detected under direct cell-cell contact conditions. Most of these proteins are exosome cargos and are involved in cell motility and tissue development. These results indicate a dynamic interaction between MSC and GBM cells, favoring aggressive tumor cell traits through alternative and independent mechanisms.

Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins.

Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections.

In total, more than 2,000 phosphoproteins of more than 4,000 phosphopeptides were identified in the four biological replicates of both states. HCD with NCE 25 accounted for 64% and NCE 35 for 36 % of identified phosphopeptides. 425 phosphopeptides were found to be significantly regulated in cisplatin-treated against control samples. KEGG pathway analysis revealed splicosomal proteins and the MAPK signaling pathway to be upregulated and cell cycle proteins to be downregulated. The transcription factors Atf2 and Jun, which are both involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, were further investigated. For Jun, more than 90 spectral counts were found only in apoptotic cells and covered the well-known stress induced phosphorylation sites at S-63/S-73, as well as S-243 which reduces the ability to bind DNA and is required for GSK3 mediated ubiquitinylation at S-239. For Atf2, more than 60 spectral counts were found in apoptotic cells vs. 8 in control cells. Most significantly upregulated sites for Atf2 have been identified at S-90 and S-112, which are less well studied phosphorylation sites of Atf2 as several other sites. Western blot analyses using non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated antibodies were performed to validate the phosphorylation events of Jun and Atf2. Our findings contribute to the current knowledge of the phosphorylation profiles of apoptotic cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""Phospho"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Propionamide"",""UNIMOD"":""24""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"",""Biological"",""Human Proteome Project""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]",": apoptosis, cisplatin, mass spectrometry, phosphoproteomics, phosphorylation","The tryptic peptide samples were analyzed using an Ultimate 3000 nano-UHPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) connected to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nano electrospray ion source. For liquid chromatography separation, an Acclaim PepMap 100 column (C18, 3 µm beads, 100 Å, 75 μm inner diameter) (Dionex, Sunnyvale CA, USA) capillary of 50 cm bed length was used. A flow rate of 300 nL/min was employed with a solvent gradient of 4-35% B in 207 min, to 50% B in 20 min and then to 80% B in 2 min. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid/90% acetonitrile. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra (from m/z 300 to 2000) were acquired with the resolution R = 70,000 at m/z 200, after accumulation to a target of 1e6. The maximum allowed ion accumulation times were 100 ms. The method used allowed sequential isolation of up to the ten most intense ions, depending on signal intensity (intensity threshold 1.7e4), for fragmentation using higher-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) at a target value of 10,000 charges and a resolution R = 17,500 with NCE 25 and NCE 35. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 60 sec. The isolation window was m/z = 2 without offset. The maximum allowed ion accumulation for the MS/MS spectrum was 60 ms. For accurate mass measurements, the lock mass option was enabled in MS mode and the polydimethylcyclosiloxane ions generated in the electrospray process from ambient air were used for internal recalibration during the analysis.  All the raw files were converted to mgf files and searched against human Swiss-Prot database (Human Swiss-Prot, release 20160121, entries 20187) using Mascot (version 2.4.0, Matrix Science, London, UK) with the following parameters: parent tolerance, 10 ppm; fragment tolerance, 0.1 Da; enzyme, trypsin; max missed cleavage, 2; fixed modification, carbamidomethyl (C); variable modifications, N-terminal acetyl (Protein), oxidation (M), and phosphorylation (S, T, Y). The search results were imported to Scaffold (version, 4.4.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA) to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm with Scaffold delta-mass correction [39]. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm [40]. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Localization of phosphorylation sites were calculated and evaluated by Mascot maximum identity score and maximum Mascot delta score (MD-score) [33].

Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms.

Whether there are differences between the levels of these peptides between term and preterm milk remains unknown. Premature milk is produced before complete maturation of the mammary gland and is under the influence of a different hormonal milieu, which could change enzymatic activity and protein expression within the mammary gland and result in an altered peptide profile. We employed nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to identify naturally occurring peptides in term and premature milks at multiple time-points across lactation and compare the abundances of these peptides. We found that preterm milks produced more unique peptide sequences than term milks on average (359 vs. 286). The peptides identified were searched for overlapping sequences with an in-house database of known functional peptides. Specifically, we found that both term and preterm milks contain peptides overlapping with known sequences with antimicrobial, opioid antagonist and immunomodulatory actions. We also compared the enzymes involved in degradation of both milks via bioinformatic analysis. This analysis reveals that plasmin is more active in preterm milk than term milk.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""mammary epithelial cell""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""deaminated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""dehydrated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""23""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""6520 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"human milk, peptidomics","Peptide analysis.

The chip employed contained an enrichment and analytical column packed with a C18 stationary phase. Q-TOF parameters were as described (14). Briefly, the gradient elution solvents were (A) 3% ACN/0.1% FA and (B) 90% ACN/0.1% FA. The gradient employed was ramped from 0–8% B from 0–5 min, 8–26.5% B from 5–24 min, 26.5–100% B from 24–42 min, followed by 100% B for 10 min, 100–0% B from 52¬–55 min and 100% A for 10 min (to re-equilibrate the column). Each sample was run on the Q-TOF in MS-only mode. Creation of peptide library. To create a peptide library, these milk samples were run using the same method but with MS/MS as described (14). Data were exported to Mascot Generic Format (.mgf) (14) and analyzed via the downloadable version of X!Tandem (thegpm.org) (10) against a library of human milk proteins derived from previous human milk proteomes (15-17). The parameters used in X!Tandem were as previously described (18). Briefly, no complete modifications were required, but possible phosphorylations of serine, threonine or tyrosine, deamidation of glutamine or asparagine, and oxidation of methionine or tryptophan were allowed. Error tolerances employed were 20 ppm for precursor masses and 40 ppm for fragment masses.  The results from X!Tandem for all samples were compiled for all milk samples. Peptides with e-values ≤ 0.01 were removed (a 99% confidence level threshold). To isolate only unique peptide sequences, all duplicates of sequence, protein and modifications combined were eliminated with the “remove duplicates” function in Excel. Peptides representing identical amino acid sequences and modifications but modified in different positions were also removed as duplicates. Additional library peptides were derived from our previous analyses of milk peptides {Dallas, 2014 #5537}. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange (19) with identifier PXD000688. Peptide identification. Compounds were identified from MS-only runs of all samples by the “Find by Formula” function in Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis version 6 against the peptide library. The library information consisted of compound formula, neutral mass, retention time and a peptide ID. The target data type was small molecule (chromatographic). Only peaks with at least 1,000 ion counts were selected. The selected charge carrier was “protons”. The isotope model was “peptides” and the maximum assigned charge was 7. After compounds were extracted, they were matched to the peptide library by mass and retention time to identify peptides. The database match employed a mass error tolerance of 20 ppm and a retention time tolerance of 1 min. Each exact peptide mass in the library was converted to an m/z for all charge states from 1-7 for the search. The resulting peaks were integrated via the “agile” algorithm.",2014-06-23,"[[""DOI:10.3945/jn.114.203646"",""PMID:25540406""]]"

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Acetyl"",""UNIMOD"":""1""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, primary human B lymphocytes, shotgun proteomics, aging, glutaminolysis, fatty acid beta oxidation, Q Exactive orbitrap","Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) was used for protein identification and qualitative data analysis.

PXD009755,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009755,LC-MSMS of the lc6 MHC class I immunopeptidome,"MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lung""]","[{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""Deamidated"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, lung cancer primary sample, LC-MSMS, MHC class I, immunopeptidome","Peptides were identified using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solution Inc.) and peptide sequences were searched against the lc6 global cancer database that was built using lc6 RNA-sequencing data (reference genome used: GRCh38.88, total number of proteins in database: 2,502,592).

Applying their antipathogenic, antiproliferative and immune stimulatory capacities, recombinant IFNs are frequently prescribed as drugs to treat different diseases. IFNs act by changing the transcription of cells. Due to characteristics like rapid induction and signaling, IFNs represent prototypic model systems for various aspects of biomedical research. In respect to the signaling and activated promoters, IFNs can be subdivided in two groups. Here, alterations of the cellular proteome of human cells treated with IFN and IFN were elucidated in a time-dependent manner by mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteome analysis.

This study aimed to investigate the SIKE interaction network to identify by association a potential function for SIKE.  Our affinity purification/mass spectrometry results showed that SIKE formed interactions with cytoskeletal proteins, nucleic acid-associated proteins, enzymes, and chaperones.  In immunofluorescence assays, endogenous SIKE localized to cytosolic puncta in epithelial and myeloid cells whilst in epithelial cells additional staining occurred in stress fiber-like structures and adjacent to the plasma membrane, whereas myeloid cells revealed SIKE associated with nuclear puncta.  Using cellular markers, significant co-occurrence of SIKE fluorescence with actin, a-actinin, tubulin, ezrin, FAK and b-catenin was detected.  Reciprocal immunoprecipitation and in vitro precipitation assays confirmed a direct SIKE interaction with tubulin and a-actinin.

PXD009339,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009339,Short-term remodeling of the host epithelial cell proteome by the listeriolysin O pore-forming toxin,"Bacterial pathogens use various strategies to interfere with host cell functions. Among these strategies, bacteria induce transcriptional changes, in order to modify the set of proteins synthetized by the host cell, or target pre-existing proteins by modulating their post-translational modifications or by triggering their degradation. Protein levels variations in host cells during infection integrates both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations induced by pathogens. Here, we focused on host proteome alterations induced by the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and more specifically the Listeria toxin Listeriolysin O (LLO).  In order to characterize host proteome alterations induced by LLO, we performed a shotgun proteomics analysis on HeLa cells treated or not with the LLO toxin. To this end, in a first analysis we used SILAC labelling (stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture) to compare in a quantitative manner the protein content from two differentially treated cell populations: one control population and one population incubated with a sublytic dose of LLO (3 nM). We decided to expose cells to LLO during only 20 min to limit protein level changes resulting from transcriptional changes. We performed two independent experiments (experiment #1 and experiment #2) with swapped SILAC labelling to rule out putative labelling-dependent effects. A total of 2,009 and 2,577 proteins was quantified in each independent experiment, respectively, and 1,834 proteins were quantified in both experiments. Among these 1834 proteins, we identified a total of 151 proteins for which protein levels were consistently decreased in cells treated with LLO (i.e. with a log2 control/LLO ratio >0.5 in both experiments).  In addition to this preliminary study, we carried out a second experiment using label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics to compare protein abundance in cells treated or not with LLO. Four independent biological replicates were included in this second screen in order to perform a robust statistical analyses of downregulated proteins. Among the 2,973 proteins that were quantified in all independent replicates, we identified a total of 149 proteins (5.0 %) for which protein levels were significantly decreased in cells treated with LLO. In contrast to these decreases, only 16 proteins (0.5 %) showed significant increased levels in LLO-treated cells. This result confirmed that LLO remodels the cell proteome mainly by decreasing the level of host targets. To assess whether the host proteasome was involved in the decrease of these 149 proteins, we repeated our label-free proteomics analysis on HeLa cells pre-treated with proteasome inhibitors before exposure to LLO. Interestingly, we observed that the vast majority (i.e. 83%) of host proteins identified as strongly downregulated in response to LLO also displayed significant decreased levels in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that the majority of observed decreases in host protein levels induced by LLO are not due to proteasome-mediated degradation. In follow-up experiments, we validated that LLO decreases in particular the protein level of two E2 ubiquitin enzymes, UBE2K and UBE2N, leading to major changes in the host ubiquitylome. This toxin-induced proteome remodeling involves post-transcriptional regulations, as no modification in the transcription levels of the corresponding genes was observed. These decreases in host protein levels were observed in different epithelial cell lines but not in macrophages. In addition, we could show that Perfringolysin O, another bacterial pore-forming toxin similar to LLO, also induces host proteome changes. Taken together, our data show that different bacterial pore-forming toxins induce deep proteome remodeling, that may impair host epithelial cell functions.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos"",""Q Exactive HF""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method"",""SILAC""]","listeria, listeriolysin O, pore-forming toxin, bacterial infection","Data analysis was performed with MaxQuant (version 1.5.6.5 for the SILAC analyses, version 1.6.0.16 for the label-free analyses) using the Andromeda search engine with default search settings including a false discovery rate set at 1% on both the peptide and protein level.

In our research, we used the human protein microarray to study the proteins interacting with PknG and have found a list of proteins that are potentially related to PknG in the host, which may contribute to the infection of Mtb. Among these positive hits, we found human protein CypA has strong interaction with PknG. We further validated the interaction between PknG and CypA in vitro and in vivo and investigated its role in the infection of macrophage cells. Finally, we found that PknG can significantly down-regulate protein expression level of CypA through phosphorylation in site of T107 as well as its induction of inflammatory response through NF-κB and ERK1/2 pathways. Meanwhile, the survival of Mycobacterium smegmetis (Msm) in the macrophages with overexpressing PknG is also improved with lessen of cytokines expression.

Here we used mass-spectrometry (MS)- and antibody-based quantitative proteomic approaches to measure protein abundances for 75% of a hand-curated reconstructed ErbB network of 198 proteins, in two established cell types (HEK293 and MCF-7) and in primary keratinocyte cells. Comparison with other quantitative studies allowed building a set of ErbB network proteins expressed in all cells and another which are cell-specific and could impart specific properties to the network. As a proof-of-concept of the importance of protein concentration, we generated a small simplified mathematical model encompassing ligand binding, followed by receptor dimerization, activation, and degradation. The model predicts ErbB phosphorylation in HEK293, MCF-7, and keratinocyte cells simply by incorporating cell-type-specific ErbB1, ErbB2, and caveolin-1 abundances but otherwise contains similar rate constants. Altogether, the data provide a resource for protein abundances and localization to be included in larger mathematical models, enabling the generation of cell-type-specific computational models.

The soluble aggregates are especially relevant because they are believed to be the most toxic form of Aβ.

N- and C-terminal truncations comprised 73% and 30%, respectively, of the number of Aβ proteoforms detected. The Aβ proteoforms segregated between the soluble and more insoluble aggregates with N-terminal truncations predominating in the insoluble material and C- terminal truncations segregating into the soluble aggregates. In contrast, canonical Aβ comprised the minority of the number of identified proteoforms (15.3%) and did not distinguish between the soluble and more insoluble aggregates. The relative abundance of many truncated Aβ proteoforms did not correlate with post-mortem interval, suggesting they are not artefacts.

The present study establishes an in-depth CSF proteome through the analysis of a unique CSF sample from a pool of healthy donors. After immuno-affinity depletion, the CSF sample was fractionated using off-gel electrophoresis and analyzed with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MS) using the latest generation of hybrid Orbitrap mass spectrometers. The shotgun proteomic analysis allowed the identification of 20689 peptides mapping on 3379 proteins. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained dataset constitutes the largest CSF proteome published so far. Among the CSF proteins identified, 34% correspond to genes defined as elevated in the brain by The Human Protein Atlas. The principal Alzheimer disease biomarkers (e.g., tau protein, amyloid-β, apolipoprotein E and neurogranin) were detected.

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""breast""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts, comparative proteome profiling, label-free quantification, primary human cells, tissue proteomics.","Protein identification was carried out using ProteomeDiscoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austria) running Mascot 2.4 (Matrix Science, UK) by searching against the SwissProt Database (version December 2012 with 20,209 protein entries) supplemented with common contaminant proteins.

Efficient protein/glycoprotein extraction is a key step in the preparation of N-glycans derived from glycoproteins prior to LC-MS analysis. Convenient, efficient and unbiased sample preparation protocols are needed. Herein, we evaluated the use of sodium deoxycholate (SDC) acidic labile detergent to release N-glycans of glycoproteins derived from biological samples such as cancer cell lines. Compared to the filter aided sample preparation approach, the sodium deoxycholate (SDC) assisted approach was determined to be more efficient and unbiased. SDC removal was determined to be more efficient when using acidic precipitation rather than ethyl acetate phase transfer. Efficient extraction of proteins/glycoproteins from biological samples was achieved by combining SDC lysis buffer and beads beating cell disruption. This was suggested by a significant overall increase in the intensities of N-glycans released from cancer cell lines. Additionally, the use of SDC approach was also shown to be more reproducible than those methods that do not use SDC.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Technical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","acidic labile detergent, sodium deoxycholate, detergent removal, N-glycomics, LC-MS/MS sample preparation","The proteomic LC-MS/MS raw data was converted to mascot generic format files (*.mgf) by Proteome Discover version 1.2 software (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) then searched using UniProt database database (2014_06, Homo sapiens, 20214 entries) in MASCOT version 2.4 (Matrix Science Inc., Boston, MA).

Here, we performed quantitative proteomic analyses of lysosomes rapidly isolated using the LysoIP method and find that nutrient levels and mTOR dynamically modulate the lysosomal proteome. We focus on NUFIP1, a protein that upon mTORC1 inhibition redistributes from the nucleus to autophagosomes and lysosomes. Upon these conditions, NUFIP1 interacts with ribosomes and delivers them to autophagosomes by directly binding to LC3B. The starvation-induced degradation of ribosomes via autophagy (ribophagy) depends on the capacity of NUFIP1 to bind LC3B and promotes cell survival.

These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cerebrospinal fluid""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""residues isobaric at 128.058578 Da"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics"",""SWATH MS""]",,"proteomics, data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry, DIA, cerebrospinal fluid, CSF, spectral library","The generated .RAW files were directly analyzed by Proteome Discoverer (PD) 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

True estimation of the contribution of proteasome-spliced peptides (PSPs) to the global Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) ligandome is critical. A recent study suggested that PSPs contribute up to 30% of the HLA ligandome. We performed a thorough reanalysis of the reported results using multiple computational tools and various validation steps and concluded that only a fraction of the proposed PSPs passes the quality filters. To better estimate the actual number of PSPs, we present an alternative workflow. We performed de-novo sequencing of the HLA-peptide spectra and discarded all de-novo sequences found in the UniProt database. We checked whether the remaining de-novo sequences could match spliced peptides from human proteins. The spliced sequences were appended to the UniProt fasta file, which was searched by two search tools at a FDR of 1%. We find that 2-6% of the HLA ligandome could be explained as spliced protein fragments. The majority of these potential PSPs have good peptide-spectrum match properties and are predicted to bind the respective HLA molecules.

Comparison of MS/MS annotations of endogenous HLA-Ip and their synthetic counterparts. To investigate if spliced peptides match the MS/MS spectra better than possible alternative sequences we first compared the MS/MS scans identified by Liepe et al. as spliced peptides and those identified by MaxQuant. The mapping to the relevant MS scans and their Mascot ion scores were kindly provided to us by the authors of (3) (Supplemental Data 6). For the Fib data, we selected three MS/MS scans of LM_spliced peptides identified both by MaxQuant and by Liepe et al., and 21 MS/MS scans corresponding to LM_spliced peptides that MaxQuant identified instead as UniProt peptides. This selection was not biased and was not based on prior knowledge, which would favor MaxQuant. We synthesized the 21 pairs of peptide sequences and the three LM_spliced peptide sequences and analyzed them by MS as mentioned above. For visual inspection we printed the endogenous and synthetic spectra to pdf files. For each of the 21 pairs, we calculated the similarity between the spectrum of the eluted peptide from Fib, annotated as LM_spliced and the spectrum of the synthetic LM_spliced peptide. We also calculated the similarity between the spectrum of the eluted peptide from Fib annotated as a UniProt peptide, and the spectrum of the synthetic Uniprot peptide. Similarly, we calculated the similarity between the three spectra of the identically identified spliced sequences and the spectra of their synthetic counterparts. The similarity was computed by the cosine score (value between 0 and 1, where a value of 0 corresponds to spectra with no peaks in common and a value of 1 to identical spectra) (19). The MzJava class library (20) was used to read the .mgf spectrum files and to calculate the similarity.",2018-08-16,"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra118.000877"",""PMID:30171158""]]"

PXD009797,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009797,"Lys-C/Arg-C, a New Enzyme Combination for Next-Generation Proteomics","Today, the most widely used bottom-up proteomics studies necessitate a proteolysis step prior to MS analysis. Trypsin is often the best protease in choice due to its high specificity and MS-favored proteolytic products. Trypsin has been challenged for its low cleavage efficiency at Lys-X bonds, and tandem Lys-C/trypsin digestion approach has been developed to alleviate the problem. However, the identification capacity of the two digestions often disagrees among different research groups. Herein, we report a new tandem digestion using Lys-C and Arg-C (Lys-C/Arg-C), which we have proven to be more efficient and specific than trypsin and Lys-C/trypsin approaches. Analysis of our previous data (Anal. Chem. 2018, 90, 1554-1559) revealed that both Lys-C and Arg-C perform better in trypsin-mode digestion. In particular for Arg-C, the identification capacity is increased to 2.6 times and even comparable with trypsin. The good complementarity, high digestion efficiency and high specificity of Lys-C and Arg-C prompt a tandem Lys-C/Arg-C digestion. We systematically evaluated the Lys-C/Arg-C digestion using qualitative and quantitative proteomics approaches and confirmed its superior performance in digestion efficiency, specificity and identification capacity to the currently widely used trypsin and Lys-C/trypsin digestions. As a result, we concluded that Lys-C/Arg-C digestion approach would be the choice of next-generation digestion approach for better results in both qualitative and quantitative proteomics studies.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine"",""UNIMOD"":""24#C""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Technical""]","[""All-ion fragmentation"",""Shotgun proteomics""]",,Lys-C / Arg-C / trypsin / DIA / mass spectrometry,"Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) Analysis LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was performed using a nanoflow EASY-nLC 1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Odense, Denmark) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). 1μg of peptide was applied for all analyses.

In vivo, PWWP2A strongly recognizes H2A.Z-containing regulatory regions and weakly H3K36me3-containing gene bodies. Additionally, PWWP2A bind to an MTA1-specific core NuRD (M1HR) complex solely consisting of MTA1, HDAC1 and RBBP4/7, excluding CHD and MBD proteins. Depletion of PWWP2A leads to an increase of acetylation levels on H3K27 as well as H2A.Z, presumably by impaired chromatin recruitment of M1HR. Thus, this study identifies PWWP2A as an ever more complex chromatin binding protein serving as adapter for M1HR to H2A.Z-containing chromatin, thereby promoting changes in histone acetylation levels and likely fine-tuning the transcriptional balance.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""monomethylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""34""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""SRM/MRM"",""Gel-based experiment""]","[""TIC""]",PWWP2A / H2A.Z / H3K36me3 / chromatin / NuRD / MTA1,"Quantification of histone modifications Data analysis was performed with Skyline (version 3.6) by using doubly and triply charged peptide masses for extracted ion chromatograms (XICs).

This revealed variable associations for thousands of proteins to DNA including their frequent and variable phosphorylation. While epigenetic modifiers that promote transcription are lost from mitotic chromatin, repressive modifiers generally remain associated. Interestingly, while proteins involved in transcriptional elongation are evicted, most identified transcription factors are retained on mitotic chromatin to varying degrees, including core promoter binding proteins. This predicts conservation of the regulatory landscape on mitotic chromosomes, which genome-wide measurements of chromatin accessibility confirm. This work establishes a novel approach to study chromatin, provides a comprehensive catalogue of chromatin changes during the cell cycle, and reveals the degree with which the genomic regulatory landscape is maintained through mitosis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""N6""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","Chromatin, Cell Cycle, Mitotic Bookmarking","Thermo MS raw data were searched against the human uniprot database (downloaded January 29 2015) and a database of common contaminants with either Thermo Proteome Discoverer PD 2.1 (Thermo Scientific) and the Sequest HT search engine or MaxQuant (version 1.5.3.8) and the Andromeda search engine.  The search parameters in PD were fully tryptic digestion, maximum of two missed cleavages, minimum peptide length of six amino acids, fixed carbamidomethyl modifications of cysteine as well as TMT6plex [+229 Da] of lysines and peptide N-termini; and oxidation of methionine as well as acetylation of the protein terminus as variable modifications. The maximum allowed mass tolerance for precursor ions measured in the Orbitrap was set to 10 ppm. The ion trap fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.6 Da. Search parameters in MaxQuant71 were essentially the same as in PD, except that the mass tolerance for precursor ions was set to 20 ppm in a first-pass search prior to mass recalibration, followed by 4.5 ppm in the main search of the re-calibrated data, and then the fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da. Protein and peptide identifications were filtered to an false-discovery rate of 0.01 based on the target-decoy search strategy72. For TMT MS3 reporter ion quantification the mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm in PD (0.1 Da in MaxQuant), only scans with average reporter ion s/n above 10 were used. Protein abundances were calculated based on the summed abundances of all unique and razor peptide reporter ion signals attributed to a protein.  For bioinformatic analyses the PD Proteins tables were exported to txt format, and the MaxQuant proteinGroups.txt table was used.  Proteome Discoverer results were first filtered for contaminants, proteins with at least 2 peptides quantified, and signal in all 3 replicates of at least one cell cycle stage. Proteins with more than one Entrez Gene ID or no ID were removed. In addition, master protein candidates were retained if peptides used in their quantification were not used in a master protein. In the case of multiple candidates for the same protein, proteins were selected by: 1) Non-isoform entry and in the case of ties, 2) Lowest coverage (longest protein).  Subsequently the reporter ion intensities for each channel were scaled down to the lowest signal reporter.  MaxQuant search results were first filtered for reverse, contaminant, and proteins with no gene name. Proteins were then filtered to have quantitative information for at least all 3 replicates of one cell cycle stage.  Intensities were then normalized using the VSN package in R as has been described for isobaric labeled peptides73. Modified peptides were first filtered on an Andromeda score >= 40 and delta score >= 8.  Subsequently, peptide reporter ion intensities were scaled using VSN as above. Clustering of proteins To identify patterns for differential chromatin binding across the measured cell cycle stages, we used linear modeling with the limma package74 to determine which proteins are significantly changing between all possible cell cycle contrasts.  Reporter ion intensities from these significantly changing proteins were clustered based on their distance to the mean for the 9 replicates measured for each peptide.

In humans, AP-4 deficiency causes a severe neurological disorder of unknown aetiology. We apply unbiased proteomic methods, including ‘Dynamic Organellar Maps’, to find proteins whose subcellular localisation depends on AP-4. We identify three transmembrane cargo proteins, ATG9A, SERINC1 and SERINC3, and two AP-4 accessory proteins, RUSC1 and RUSC2. We demonstrate that AP-4 deficiency causes missorting of ATG9A in diverse cell types, including patient-derived cells, as well as dysregulation of autophagy. RUSC2 facilitates the transport of AP-4-derived, ATG9A-positive vesicles from the TGN to the cell periphery. These vesicles cluster in close association with autophagosomes, suggesting they are the “ATG9A reservoir” required for autophagosome biogenesis. Our study uncovers ATG9A trafficking as a ubiquitous function of the AP-4 pathway. Furthermore, it provides a potential molecular pathomechanism of AP-4 deficiency, through dysregulated spatial control of autophagy.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"AP-4, autophagy, vesicles, human cells, Dynamic Organellar Maps","Mass spectrometry raw files were processed in MaxQuant version 1.5, using the human SwissProt canonical and isoform protein database, retrieved from UniProt (www.uniprot.org).

RNA sequencing and mass-spectrometry identified actin cytoskeleton as the most miss-regulated feature during the ciliary cycle of KDM3A null cells and revealed that IFT81 contains Nε-methylated lysines in vivo to which recombinant KDM3A binds without subsequent demethylation. Mutations in these IFT81 methyl-lysine residues however stabilize KDM3A null cilia and potentiate ciliogenesis surpassing wild type cells; a synergism phenocopied by wild type cultures through the simultaneous destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton when over-expressing IFT81 lysine-mutants.

This pattern is recapitulated by TDP-43 overexpression, suggesting a primary role for TDP-43 in RNA destabilization, and in post-mortem samples from ALS and FTD patients. Proteomics and functional studies illustrate corresponding reductions in mitochondrial components and compensatory increases in protein synthesis.

Here we present the utilization of a high-performance multiplex proteomics approach based on depletion of highly abundant plasma proteins and enrichment of low abundance proteins and quantitation using a combination of label-free and isobaric labeling strategies for PDE samples from PD patients (n=20), who received either standard PD fluid or a novel PD fluid (added alanyl-glutamine (AlaGln)) in an open-label, randomized, two-period, cross-over clinical trial.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""peritoneal dialysis fluid""]","[{""ptm"":""Carbamidomethyl"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""Oxidation"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex"",""UNIMOD"":""737""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","peritoneal dialysis, plasma proteins, biomarkers, TMT, cytoprotection","The acquired raw MS data ﬁles were processed with msconvert (ProteoWizard Library v2.1.2708) and converted into Mascot generic format (mgf) ﬁles. The resultant peak lists was searched against the human SwissProt database version v2013.01_20130110 (37398 sequences, including isoforms as obtained from varsplic.pl) with the search engines Mascot (v2.3.02, MatrixScience, London, U.K.) and Phenyx (v2.5.14, GeneBio, Geneva, Switzerland). Submission to the search engines was via a Perl script that performs an initial search with relatively broad mass tolerances (Mascot only) on both the precursor and fragment ions (±10 ppm and ±0.6 Da, respectively). High-conﬁdence peptide identiﬁcations were used to recalibrate all precursor and fragment ion masses prior to a second search with narrower mass tolerances (±4 ppm and ±0.025 Da). One missed tryptic cleavage site was allowed. Carbamidomethyl cysteine, N-terminal, and lysine-modiﬁed TMT 6plex were set as ﬁxed modiﬁcations, and oxidized methionine was set as a variable modiﬁcation. To validate the proteins, Mascot and Phenyx output ﬁles were processed by internally developed parsers. Proteins with ≥2 unique peptides above a score T1 or with a single peptide above a score T2 were selected as unambiguous identiﬁcations. Additional peptides for these validated proteins with score >T3 were also accepted. For Mascot and Phenyx, T1, T2, and T3 were equal to 16, 40, 10 and 5.5, 9.5, 3.5, respectively (p-value <10−3). Following the selection criteria, proteins were grouped on the basis of shared peptides, and only the group reporters are considered in the ﬁnal output of identiﬁed proteins. Spectral conﬂicts between Mascot and Phenyx peptide identiﬁcations were discarded. The whole procedure was repeated against a reversed database to assess the protein group false discovery rate (FDR). Peptide and protein group identiﬁcations were <0.1 and <1% FDR, respectively. Identified keratins (n=18) were only excluded from the results if containing the terms “hair” or “cuticular” as cytokeratins are markers of mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal wall.  TMT Semiquantitative Analysis The R software package Isobar (Breitwieser et al., J Prot Res 2011) was used to calculate protein ratios. Isobar is publically available under the LGPL license from the CeMM Web site (http://bioinformatics.cemm.oeaw. ac.at) and through Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/ packages/release/bioc/html/isobar.html). Isobar implements a signal intensity noise model to account for heteroscedasticity in TMT reporter ion ratios and calculates p values for each quantitated protein estimating technical and biological variability. The statistical framework of Isobar was described previously (Breitwieser et al., J Prot Res 2011). TMT reporter ions were extracted at the expected m/z ± 0.005 m/z, and intensities were corrected for isotopic impurities, as supplied by the manufacturer. All channels were normalized to equal sum of intensities. Protein identiﬁcations were grouped based on peptide matches from both samples. Protein ratios were calculated based on unique peptides. Proteins were denoted as signiﬁcantly regulated (in one sample) when the ratio p value was <0.05, and the protein also had a ratio >2.5 times the median absolute deviation from the median. For further analysis, proteins were selected that were signiﬁcant in one or both samples and showed the same direction of change with a ratio p value of <0.05 in both samples. A protein was also selected if there was a signiﬁcant change in one sample only.",2017-09-28,"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra117.000186"",""PMID:29208752""]]"

Here we demonstrate that optimization of LC gradient and analytical column construction can reveal over 30,000 unique peptides and 23,000 phosphopeptides at high confidence. The quantitative reproducibility of different analytical workflows was evaluated by comparing the phosphoproteome of CD3/4 stimulated and unstimulated T-cells as a model system.  A fritless, 50 cm-long column packed with 1.9 µm particles operated with a standard pressure HPLC significantly improved the sequencing depth 51% and decreased the selected ion chromatogram peak spreading. Most importantly, under the optimal workflow we observed an improvement of 330% in detection of significantly changed phosphopeptides in the stimulated cells compared with the other workflows. The discovery power of the optimized column configuration was illustrated by identification of significantly altered phosphopeptides harboring novel sites from proteins previously established as important in T cell signaling including A-Raf, B-Raf, c-Myc, CARMA1, Fyn, ITK, LAT, NFAT1/2/3, PKCα, PLCγ1/2, RAF1, and SOS1.

However, their complex-specific targeting on chromatin, functions and roles in disease remain largely unknown. Here, we comprehensively map complex assemblies on chromatin and find that ncBAF uniquely localizes to CTCF sites and promoters. We identified ncBAF subunits as major synthetic lethalities specific to human synovial sarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumor, which share in common cBAF complex perturbation. Chemical and biological depletion of the BRD9 subunit of ncBAF rapidly attenuates SS and MRT cell proliferation. Notably, in cBAF-perturbed cancers, ncBAF complexes retain localization to CTCF sites and promoters, and maintain gene expression at retained mSWI/SNF sites to support cell proliferation in a manner distinct from fusion oncoprotein-mediated targeting.

Here, we addressed the microenvironment remodeling occurring during in vitro differentiation of human neural stem cells (NSC) in a three-dimensional (3D) culture system. Proteome and transcriptome dynamics revealed significant changes namely at cell membrane and ECM composition during 3D differentiation, diverging significantly from the profile of monolayer cultures (2D). Structural proteoglycans typically found in brain ECM were enriched during 3D differentiation, while 2D cultures presented increased levels of basement membrane constituents (e.g., laminins, collagens and fibrillins). Moreover, higher expression levels of synaptic machinery and ion transport machinery constituents observed for 3D cultures, both at mRNA and protein levels, suggested a higher degree of neuronal maturation and organization relative to 2D differentiation. This work demonstrated that neural cellular and extracellular features can be recapitulated in the presented 3D neural cell model, highlighting its value to address molecular defects in cell-ECM interactions associated with neurological disorders.

A reversed phase nanoLC with a trap and elution configuration, using a Nano cHiPLC Trap column (200 μm × 0.5 mm ChromXP C18-CL 3 μm 120 Å) and nano column (75 μm × 15 cm ChromXP C18-CL 3 μm 120 Å) was performed. Water with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (solvent B) were used. Sample was loaded in the trap column at a flow rate of 2 μL.min-1 for 10 min using 100% (v/v) solvent A. Peptide separation was performed in the nano column at a flow rate of 300 μL.min-1 applying a 90 min linear gradient of 5% to 30% (v/v) of solvent B. Each sample was subjected to two IDA runs. The mass spectrometer was set for IDA scanning full spectra (400–2000 m/z) for 250 ms. The top 50 ions were selected for subsequent MS/MS scans (150–1800 m/z for 40 ms each) using a total cycle time of 2.3 s. The selection criteria for parent ions included a charge state between +2 and +5, and counts above a minimum threshold of 125 counts per second. Ions were excluded from further MS/MS analysis for 12 s. Fragmentation was performed using rolling collision energy with a collision energy spread of 5. The spectral library was created by combining all IDA raw files using ProteinPilot™ software (v5.0 ABSciex) with the Paragon algorithm and with the following search parameters: search against Homo sapiens from Uniprot/SwissProt database (release 2015_05); trypsin digestion; iodoacetamide cysteine alkylation; through identification efforts. After a false discovery rate (FDR) analysis, only FDR<1% were considered (3272 proteins). The output of these searches, in the form of a group file, was used as the reference spectral library. An extended spectral library was built by merging the spectral library containing the IDA runs with an in-house spectral library of human samples, using SwathXtend R package (Wu and Pascovici, 2015). This spectral ion library contains 5458 proteins.  For quantitative analysis, 2.5 μg of each sample were subjected to three SWATH runs (Sequential Windowed data independent Acquisitions of the Total High-resolution Mass Spectra). Similar chromatographic conditions to the previously described IDA runs were used. The mass spectrometer was operated in a cyclic product ion data independent acquisition (DIA). A variable windows calculator and SWATH acquisition method editor (AB SCIEX) were used to setup the SWATH acquisition. A set of 32 overlapping windows (containing 1 m/z for the window overlap) was constructed, covering the precursor mass range of 400 – 1200 m/z. A 50 ms survey scan was acquired at the beginning of each cycle, and SWATH MS/MS spectra were collected for 96 ms resulting in a cycle time of 3.172 s. Rolling collision energy with a collision energy spread of 15 was used. The spectral alignment and targeted data extraction of DIA samples were performed using PeakView v.2.1 (AB SCIEX; Framingham, US) with the reference spectral library. For data extraction the following parameters were used: six peptides/protein, six transitions/peptide, peptide confidence level of >99%, FDR threshold of 1%, excluded shared peptides, and extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) window of 10 min and width set at 20 ppm. A total of 3728 proteins were quantified under these conditions.

PXD007234,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007234,Menstrual fluid factors facilitate tissue repair: Identification and functional action in endometrial and skin repair,"Repair after damage is essential for tissue homeostasis. Post-menstrual repair of the uterine endometrium is a unique cyclical manifestation of rapid, scar-free, tissue repair taking ~3-5 days. Skin repair post-wounding is slower (~2 weeks) and, in the case of chronic wounds, takes months/years to restore integrity. Herein, the unique ‘rapid-repair’ endometrial environment is translated to the ‘slower-repair’ skin environment. Menstrual fluid (MF), the milieu of post-menstrual endometrial repair, facilitates healing of endometrial and keratinocyte ‘wounds’ in vitro, promoting cellular adhesion and migration, stimulates keratinocyte migration in an ex vivo human skin-reconstruct model and promotes re-epithelialization in an in vivo porcine wound model. Proteomic analysis of MF identified a large number of proteins; several proteins were selected for further investigation, with the endometrium demonstrated as the source of these factors. Functionally, they promote repair of endometrial and keratinocyte wounds by promoting migration, differing significantly from currently available wound-repair treatments, which mainly promote proliferation. Development of these and other menstrual fluid factors into a ‘migration-inducing’ treatment paradigm will provide novel therapies for tissue repair.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood plasma""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TIC""]","Human, woulnd healing factors","The raw files were analysed using the MaxQuant software (version 1.4.1.2)78, The database search was performed using the Ludwig NR non-redundant protein database (version Q113, http://www.wehi.edu.au/faculty/advanced_research_technologies/proteomics/wehi_systems_biology_mascot_server/) with strict trypsin specificity allowing up to 4 missed cleavages.

Here, we show that dimerization of AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) is induced by receptor agonists but not by antagonists. The 2.15-Å crystal structure of homodimeric, agonist- and coactivator peptide bound AR-LBD unveils a 1,000-Å2 large dimerization surface, which harbors over 40 previously unexplained AIS- and PCa-associated point mutations. An AIS mutation in the self-association interface (P767A) disrupts dimer formation in vivo, and has a detrimental effect on the transactivating properties of full-length AR, despite retained hormone-binding capacity. The conservation of essential residues suggests that the newly unveiled dimerization mechanism might be shared by other nuclear receptors.

PXD009234,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009234,Global phosphoproteomic analysis identifies SRMS-regulated signaling intermediates,"The non-receptor tyrosine kinase, SRMS (Src-related kinase lacking C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and N-terminal myristoylation sites) is a member of the BRK family kinases (BFKs) which represents an evolutionarily conserved relative of the Src family kinases (SFKs). Tyrosine kinases are known to regulate a number of cellular processes and pathways via phosphorylating substrate proteins directly and/or by partaking in signaling cross-talks leading to the indirect modulation of various signaling intermediates. In a previous study, we profiled the tyrosine-phosphoproteome of SRMS and identified multiple candidate substrates of the kinase. In order to uncover the broader SRMS-regulated phosphoproteome and identify the SRMS-regulated indirect signaling intermediates, we performed global phosphoproteomics analysis on cells expressing wild-type SRMS. Our analyses identified 60 hyperphosphorylated (phosphoserine/phosphothreonine) proteins mapped from 140 hyperphosphorylated peptides. Bioinfomatics analyses identified a number of significantly enriched biological and cellular processes among which DNA repair pathways were found to be upregulated while apoptotic pathways were found to be downregulated. Analyses of motifs derived from the upregulated phosphosites identified Casein kinase 2 alpha (CK2) as one of the major potential kinases contributing to the SRMS-dependent indirect regulation of signaling intermediates. Overall, our phosphoproteomics analyses identified serine/threonine phosphorylation dynamics as important secondary events of the SRMS-regulated phosphoproteome with implications in the regulation of cellular and biological processes.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"SRMS, PTK70, Src, BRK, FRK, PTK6, PTK5, non-receptor tyrosine kinase, phosphoproteomics, mass spectrometry","Label-free quantitation of the raw LC-MS/MS data was performed using the Progenesis QI software (Version 3.0, Nonlinear Dynamics). All MS/MS spectra were searched against the SWISSProt database (taxonomy restricted to Homo sapiens, database version dated November 2015) using the Mascot search engine (Version 2.0).  Data from the TiO2-enriched and flow through fractions were analyzed separately, and the resulting quantitative analyses were combined for the respective experimental conditions. Chromatographic/spectral alignment, mass spectral peak-picking, data filtering and statistical analyses for the protein and peptide quantitation was performed on Progenesis QI. Raw mass spectral features were aligned based on their retention time using a randomly selected reference run. All other runs were automatically aligned to the reference run to minimize retention time variability between the runs. Only spectra with ion signals quantified at or above three times the standard deviation of the noise, were selected for subsequent analyses. A normalization factor for each run was calculated to account for the variability in sample loading and ionization. This normalization factor was determined by calculating the quantitative ratio of the reference run to the run being normalized, with the assumption that most proteins/peptides are not changing in the experiment. The experimental set-up grouped replicates of each condition for comparative analyses. The algorithm then calculated and tabulated raw and normalized abundances and ANOVA p-values (calculated as the mean difference and variance associated with the replicate data in both experimental conditions) for each quantified peptide in the dataset.

Despite their teratogenicity, thalidomide and related IMiD drugs are now a mainstay of cancer treatment, however, the molecular basis underlying the pleiotropic biology and characteristic birth defects remains unknown. Here we show that IMiDs disrupt a broad transcriptional network through induced degradation of several C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, including SALL4, a member of the Spalt-like family of developmental transcription factors. Strikingly, heterozygous loss of function mutations in SALL4 result in a human developmental condition that phenocopies thalidomide induced birth defects such as absence of thumbs, phocomelia, defects in ear and eye development, and congenital heart disease. We find that thalidomide induces degradation of SALL4 exclusively in humans, primates and rabbits, but not in rodents or fish, providing a mechanistic link for the species-specific pathogenesis of thalidomide syndrome.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","IMiDs, thalidomide, ubiquitin, cullin, crl4","Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher) was used for .RAW file processing and controlling peptide and protein level false discovery rates, assembling proteins from peptides, and protein quantification from peptides.

These data support the notion that T1D patients have increased intestinal inflammation and decreased barrier function. They also confirmed that pancreatic exocrine dysfunction occurs in new-onset T1D patients and show for the first time that this dysfunction is present in high-risk individuals prior to disease onset.

For data dependent analysis, the library of 4783 SOMAmer®s were multiplexed in sets of 8 and used for enrichment of target proteins from cell lysate and conditioned media, as well as human plasma and serum.  A subset of the SOMAmer®s were screened in urine by this global profiling technique as well.  Cell lines were selected from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia for screening by comparing gene expression of the target proteins measured by RNA sequencing across the CCLE.1  Using the criterion of FPKM value greater than 5 for the target protein, the minimum number of cell lines was grown to maximize protein coverage across the SOMAmer® library.  For a given cell line, the presence of at least 8 target proteins with FPKM values greater than 5was required for inclusion.  Approximately 400 target proteins were not covered by this strategy were screened in serum and plasma only.  For enrichment from biological matrices, SOMAmer®s were combined into sets of 8 such that the potential interaction with similar proteins or binding partners was minimized.  Non-specific binding of the SOMAmer®s was assessed in each matrix by using a SOMAmer® generated against the bacterial protein CysH.  Target protein spectral counts in the SOMAmer® enriched samples were compared to the respective CysH control.  A positive hit is defined as target protein detection with a minimum of 2 spectral counts and signal over CysH background greater than 10X (if applicable).","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""urine""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Technical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","Blood serum, blood plasma, cell lysate, conditioned media, aptamer, SOMAmer","The data were searched using Uniprot Human canonical database (v Jan 2014) with common contaminants and reverse database appended (43136 sequences; 23452844 residues).

For example, accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA degradation can trigger a reduction in mammalian RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription, although signals that connect these seemingly distal processes remain largely unknown. Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling with mass spectrometry to chart how changes in Xrn1-dependent mRNA degradation impact nuclear-cytoplasmic protein distribution in human cells. Notably, accelerating mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease known to coordinate with Xrn1 drove nuclear relocalization of many RNA binding proteins. Particularly enriched in the relocalized subset were factors linked to the poly(A) tail. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization and/or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this well-known phenomenon remain elusive. Here we report that a single bout of exercise induces marked activation of glycogen synthase (GS) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) for several days beyond normalized muscle glycogen content in man. Acute muscle specific deletion of AMPK activity in mouse muscle abrogated the ability for glycogen supercompensation, providing genetic evidence that AMPK serves as essential driver for glycogen supercompensation. Muscle proteomic analyses revealed elevated glucose uptake capacity in the prior exercised muscle while key proteins in fat oxidation and glycolysis largely remained unchanged. The temporal order of these sustained cellular alterations induced by a single bout of exercise provide a mechanism to offset the otherwise tight feedback inhibition of glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake by glycogen, ultimately leading to muscle glycogen supercompensation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""skeletal muscle""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive HF""]","[""Biological""]","[""SWATH MS""]",,human skeletal muscle exercise glycogen,"Peptides were spiked with iRT peptides (Biognosys) and analysed on an Easy-nLC1200 coupled to a Q-Exactive HF-X in positive polarity mode.

However, the role for RIPK2’s kinase activity remains unclear. Here, we reveal that RIPK2 kinase activity is dispensable for NOD2 inflammatory signaling and show that RIPK2 inhibitors function instead by antagonizing XIAP-binding and XIAP-mediated ubiquitination of RIPK2. We map the XIAP binding site on RIPK2 to the loop between 2 and 3 of the N-lobe of the kinase, which is in close proximity to the ATP-binding pocket. Through characterization of a new series of ATP-competitive RIPK2 inhibitors, we identify the molecular features that determine their inhibition of both the RIPK2-XIAP interaction, and of cellular and in vivo NOD2 signaling. Our study exemplifies how targeting of the ATP-binding pocket in RIPK2 can be exploited to interfere with the RIPK2-XIAP interaction for modulation of NOD signaling.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""}]","[""Q Exactive HF""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","Ponatinib, chemical proteomics, RIPK2","Data analysis The raw data was processed using MaxQuant version 1.5.0.253 and the reference complete human proteome FASTA file (Uniprot).

We combined SrtA labeling of whole-cell lysates with a potent and selective NMT inhibitor, delivering a method capable of quantifying changes in cellular NMT activity in multiple substrates at the whole proteome level. This method shows good overlap in substrates with a previously reported YnMyr metabolic tagging strategy (PXD002687), and a similar capability to measure cellular NMT activity. The SrtA-based approach described here is complementary to YnMyr metabolic tagging, since the increase in signal for newly synthesized proteins exposing an N-terminal glycine mirrors the loss of signal seen with YnMyr. Importantly, this new method overcomes the limitations imposed by metabolic tagging. Since SrtA labeling is performed post-lysis this labeling strategy provides a readout of the cell status in the absence of any external perturbation and is applicable to virtually any type of biological sample, giving clear advantages over other in-cell labeling strategies. We anticipate that this method will enable the exploration of new avenues for NMT as a therapeutic target by providing a method for de novo identification of substrates most responsive to NMT inhibition, and a multifuctional target engagement biomarker assay suited to both animal models and patient biopsies.

The 20S proteasome substrate group, termed 20S-IDPome are characterized by having significantly more protein binding partners, more post-translational modification sites and are highly enriched for RNA binding proteins. Remarkably, we found that low complexity proteins with prion-like domain which interact with GR or PR di-peptide repeats are the most preferential 20S proteasome substrates.

PXD002736,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD002736,Quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis uncovers the regulatory networks of minichromosome maintenance protein 2 in lung cancer cells,"Minichromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM2) is a licensing factor for DNA replication. It interacts with other MCM proteins to comprise MCM2-7 complex, which acts as a helicase for DNA unwinding and limits DNA replication to one round per cell cycle. MCM2 has been widely used as a biomarker for proliferation in many types of cancer. However, the molecular regulation underlying MCM2 in lung cancer cells is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of MCM2 in lung adenocarcinoma A549 (wild-type p53) and H1299 (null p53) cells. MCM2 overexpression increased cell proliferation in A549 cells while silencing MCM2 decreased cell proliferation in H1299 cells. We performed global quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis to uncover the important downstream networks regulated by MCM2 in lung cancer cells. We identified 1484 phosphorylation sites in 593 phosphoproteins of MCM2-overexpressed A549 cells. Of these phosphosites, 110 phosphoproteins were significantly changed in response to MCM2 overexpression. In addition, we identified 1599 phosphorylation sites in 592 phosphoproteins of MCM2-silenced H1299 cells. Of these phosphosites, 57 phosphoproteins were significantly changed in response to MCM2 silencing. The differentially regulated phosphoproteins are involved in biological functions such as RNA splicing, cell cycle and cytoskeleton regulation. Functional study demonstrated that MCM2 overexpression promoted cell migration in A549 cells. Moreover, silencing MCM2 inhibits cell migration and induces cell cycle arrest in H1299 cells. Furthermore, we observed a common phosphorylation change at Ser-99 of high mobility group protein HMG-I/HMG-Y (HMGA1) in both MCM2 overexpression and silencing, indicating an important regulatory effect of Ser-99 HMGA1 on lung cancer cells. The phosphoproteomic profiling of MCM2 in lung cancer cells provides new insight about phosphorylation networks regulated by MCM2 and reveals novel targets for lung cancer therapy.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Quantitative phosphoproteome, minichromosome maintenance protein-2, regulatory networks, lung cancer cells","All raw LC-MS/MS data were analyzed by MaxQuant version 1.5.0.30 using the Andromeda Search engine and searched against the human Swiss-Prot database, the reviewed part of Uniprot, without isoforms (September 2014 release).

Two subgroups of CAD patients with divergent concentrations (under and upper the median concentration of the population distribution=10mg/dL) of total circulating Apo C-III were examined using a shotgun proteomic approach. 180 plasma proteins of CAD patients were quantified and the data were analyzed by bioinformatic tools and multivariate statistics.

Three kinases can phosphorylate AMPK at Thr172: the tumor suppressor LKB1, CAMKK2 and TAK1.  While LKB1- and CAMKK2-mediated AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation have been well-characterized, much less is known about TAK1-dependent AMPK phosphorylation.  An important target of TAK1 is IκB kinase (IKK) which controls NF-B transcription factor activation.  Here, we tested the hypothesis that IKK acted downstream of TAK1 to activate AMPK by phosphorylating Thr172. IKK was required for phosphorylation of Thr172 in AMPK in response to treatment with IL-1 or TNF- treatment or by TAK1 overexpression.  Additionally, IKK regulated basal AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation in several cancer cell types independently of TAK1, indicating that other modes of IKK activation could lead to AMPK activation.  We found that IKK directly phosphorylated AMPK at Thr172 independently of LKB1 or energy stress.  This finding indicated that while LKB1 activates AMPK as a sensor of energetic stress, IKK activated AMPK in response to extracellular inflammatory signals and through distinct pathways downstream of IKK activation.  Accordingly, in LKB1-deficient cells, IKK inhibition caused a reduction in AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation in response to the mitochondrial inhibitor phenformin.  This response led to enhanced apoptosis and suggests that IKK inhibition in combination with phenformin could be used clinically to treat patients with LKB1-deficient cancers.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]",,IKK;AMPK; Inflammation; IL-1; Phenformin,"The Raw file for was searched using MASCOT (Matrix Science, Ver. 2.3.02) via Proteome Discoverer (Thermo., Ver. 1.3.0.339) against the FASTA sequence for 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha-1 downloaded from Uniprot (Q13131).

PXD009161,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009161,Nrf2 sequesters Keap1 preventing podosome disassembly,"Nrf2 is a transcription factor playing an essential role in stress response. A knowledge of the significance of Nrf2 in cell function has not, as yet, reached out beyond transactivation of gene expression. This paper shows that GDF-15 and SDF-1-induced angiogenesis strongly depends on Nrf2 presence, but is not related to its transcriptional activity. We propose, that Nrf2 serves as a protein restraining Keap1, its known transcriptional repressor. Deficiency of Nrf2 protein available for Keap1 leads to overabundance of RhoGAP1, the protein regulating Cdc42 activity, and impairs podosome assembly, thereby indisposing actin rearrangements, preventing migration and angiogenesis. These activities can be rescued by concomitant deletion of RhoGAP1 or Keap1. We suggest that a new Nrf2 function of a Keap1 scavenger implies revising the established murine model of Nrf2 deficiency as a transcriptional knock out (tKO) mouse. The N-terminal fragment of Nrf2, containing Neh2 domain binding Keap1, is present in these animals. Thus, regarding the function of Nrf2 as a protein sequestering Keap1, both published and unpublished data on Nrf2-Keap1 duet may gain new interpretation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"human, cells","Data were analyzed with the Max-Quant (Version 1.6.0.1) platform using mode match between runs (Cox and Mann, 2008).

Here we show that lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) preferably locates in the nucleus in HPV16-positive cervical tumors due to E7-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Surprisingly, nuclear LDHA gains a non-canonical enzyme activity to produce α-hydroxybutyrate and triggers DOT1L (disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like)-mediated histone H3K79 hypermethylation, resulting in the activation of antioxidant responses and Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, HPV16 E7 knocking-out reduces LDHA nuclear translocation and H3K79 tri-methylation in K14-HPV16 transgenic mouse model. HPV16 E7 level is significantly positively correlated with nuclear LDHA and H3K79 tri-methylation in cervical cancer. Collectively, our findings uncover a non-canonical enzyme activity of nuclear LDHA to epigenetically control cellular redox balance and cell proliferation facilitating HPV-induced cervical cancer development.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""Applied Biosystems cleavable ICAT(TM) light"",""UNIMOD"":""105#C""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""ICAT""]","HPV, Cervical cancer, Redox proteomics","Data were analysed by ProteinPilot program (v5.0.1) according to default parameters.

We have recently reported cytotoxic effects of xyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate derived from a human breast carcinoma cell line, HCC70, and shown that it differs in disaccharide composition from non-toxic chondroitin/dermatan sulfate derived from a human breast fibroblast cell line, CCD-1095Sk. To further investigate the structural requirements for the cytotoxic effect, we have here developed a novel LC-MS/MS approach based on dibutylamine ion-pairing reversed-phase chromatography and negative mode higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD), and used it in combination with cell growth studies and disaccharide fingerprinting. This allowed for detailed structural characterization of linkage regions, internal oligosaccharides, and non-reducing ends, showing not only differences between xyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells and CCD-1095Sk cells, but also in sialylation of the linkage region as well as previously undescribed methylation and sulfation of the non-reducing ends. Although the xyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells was less complex in terms of presence and distribution of iduronic acid than that from CCD-1095Sk cells, both glucuronic acid and iduronic acid appeared essential for the cytotoxic effect. Our data have moved us one step closer to understanding the structure of the cytotoxic chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells primed on xylosides, and demonstrate the suitability of the LC-MS/MS approach for structural characterization of glycosaminoglycans.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""sulfated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""40""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,Glycosaminoglycan; glycomics; reversed-phase chromatography; ion-pairing chromatography; LC-MS/MS; HCD; negative mode electrospray;,Data was assessed manualy using the Xcalibur 3 software (Thermo Fischer Scientific).,2018-05-02,"[[""DOI:10.1074/jbc.ra118.002971"",""PMID:29739851""]]"

In this form or when bound to a solid support (bNID1), NID1 failed to induce NK cell cytotoxicity or cytokine release.

However, despite the initial response, most patients become resistant. The majority of research regarding resistance has been focused on acquired resistance occurring after an extensive time of treatment. This has resulted in the development of combination treatments. Yet, the question remains how cells are able to survive initial treatment. We hypothesize that early resistance to apoptosis will enable cells to develop any growth stimulating mechanism.  Our results show that regardless of an initial drug response, drug sensitive cells rapidly adapted to targeted therapy. Within days they continued to proliferate, despite persisting target inhibition. The Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) PC9 cell line was used for analysis of its full proteome, kinome and phospho-proteome during early adaptive resistance development against the EGFR targeted Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Afatinib. The proteomics data showed an increase in abundance and activity of cytoskeleton and calcium signaling related proteins. In addition, cells showed a distinct morphological change. We found that if cells were deprived from calcium in order to restrict them from reorganizing their cytoskeleton, they were no longer able to survive TKI treatment. This could be validated on four different NSCLC cell lines, bearing different genetic backgrounds and sensitivities to initial TKI treatment targeting the EGFR. Therapeutically, increasing the efficiency of TKI treatment, and therefore early inhibition of adaption could potentially prevent further resistance development.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""Q Exactive HF""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free"",""SILAC""]",EGFR; adaptive resistance; Non-small lung Cancer; Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors; Calcium Signaling,All MS data was searched using MaxQuant.

Using public microarray dataset, a highly significant overlaps were observed in differentially expressed transcripts following knockdown of REST and interacting proteins such as HDAC5, HMGA1 and TRIM28, suggesting that the REST might cross-talk with those transcription regulators to regulate transcription of shared target genes.

Bioinformatics analysis and functional study demonstrated that these up- regulated mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins enhanced ATP production  and simultaneously ROS releasing. More importantly, the increased ROS led to  organelle secondary injury and the lagged DNA double strand breaks.

PXD005267,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD005267,Quantitative Proteomics analysis of Plasmodium vivax induced alterations in human serum during the acute and convalescent phases of infection,"Malaria is by far the world’s most significant tropical infectious disease and over the last a few decades large-scale malaria epidemics have happened in almost all continents. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax account for over 90% of the total malaria cases worldwide. The estimated number of annual clinical cases of vivax malaria is even higher than that of falciparum malaria, but yet the morbidity associated with this infection and its spectrum of disease is largely neglected. Identification of serum/plasma proteins, which exhibit altered abundance at the onset and during the acute phase of any infection, could be informative to understand the pathobiology of different infectious diseases and host responses against the invading pathogens. To this end, in recent years, quite a few research groups including us have investigated alterations in serum/plasma proteome in severe and non-severe falciparum malaria (and also vivax malaria) to study malaria pathogenesis. In all these studies, serum/plasma proteome of the malaria patients have been analyzed during the febrile stages of the infection, either at the onset of the disease or at the fastigium stage. However, temporal profiling of serum/plasma proteome during acute and remission stages in malaria, which can provide snapshots of the transient and enduring alterations in serum proteome during the febrile, defervescence and convalescent stages has not been reported hitherto.  Here, we report, for the first time, serum proteomic alterations in a longitudinal cohort of P. vivax infected patients to elucidate host responses when fever is established (temperature of the body reaches above higher normal level), during the stage when the temperature comes down to normal, and also during the gradual recovery of health after the illness.  The three stages discussed in our study have been categorically chosen depending upon the clinical course of uncomplicated vivax malaria. Analysis of the early febrile stage represents host proteome profile immediately after onset of the infection, without any effect of anti-malarial drugs. The second, defervescence stage, reflects any immediate change in blood proteome at early recovery phase, while the convalescent stage indicates a phase after administration of 14 days radical cure treatment with primaquine and a complete recovery, when none of the patients displayed any apparent symptoms of malaria. We have also performed an extensive quantitative proteomics analysis to compare the serum proteome profiles of vivax malaria patients with low and moderately-high parasitemia with healthy community controls. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and 2-D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based quantitative proteomics approaches were used in the discovery-phase of the study, and some selected differentially abundant serum proteins were validated further by using ELISA. Interestingly, some of the serum proteins like Serum amyloid A, Apolipoprotein A1, C-reactive protein, Titin and Haptoglobin, were found to be sequentially altered with respect to increased parasite counts, while many of the quantified candidates such as Hemopexin, Vitronectin, Clusterin and Apolipoprotein E exhibited nearly equal levels of differential serum abundance in different parasitemic malaria patients. Analysis of a longitudinal cohort of malaria patients indicated reversible alterations in serum levels of some proteins such as Haptoglobin, Apolipoprotein E, Apolipoprotein A1, Carbonic anhydrase 1, and Hemoglobin subunit alpha upon treatment; however, the levels of a few other proteins did not return to the baseline even during the convalescent phase of the infection. Identification of the differentially abundant serum proteins and associated physiological pathways in vivax malaria along with phase-specific protein profiles during the acute and convalescent phases of the infection can effectively enhance our understanding of P. vivax disease biology and host immune responses.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood serum""]","[{""ptm"":""iTRAQ4plex-116 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""}]","[""6220 Time-of-Flight LC/MS""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""iTRAQ""]","Human, Longitudinal, LC-MS","Protein identification and quantification of the iTRAQ reporter ion intensities were performed using Spectrum Mill identification software (Agilent Technologies, USA).

PXD006856,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006856,Naa80 acetylates the actin N-terminus impacting the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility,"Eukaryotic actins undergo several post-translational modifications during their maturation to enable a fully functional cytoskeletal network. A unique N-terminal processing is conserved in the animal kingdom and includes the removal of the first one or two amino acids as well as N-terminal acetylation of the newly exposed acidic N-termini. These events have been known for decades, but the mechanism and function of actin N-terminal acetylation are not well understood due to the lack of information on the catalysing N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT). Here, we show that NAA80, previously known as NAT6 or FUS-2,is a unique, animal kingdom-specific NAT that exclusively N-terminally acetylates actins. In vitro, the lack of actin N-terminal acetylation impedes the actin polymerization rate due to decreased formin-mediated filament elongation, while the depolymerisation rate is unaffected. Human NAA80 knockout cells display a complete loss of actin N-terminal acetylation and a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We reveal Naa80 as the enzyme that specifically N-terminally acetylates actin the most abundant protein in animal cells, and that this modification controls cellular dynamics and cytoskeletal functions. In this project acetylation of actins was investigated with the use of LC-MS/MS and MS1 quantitation of the Total Ion Current signal.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive HF""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 based isotope labeling""]","human,  NAT, actin, N-terminal acetylation","Mascot generic files were created using the Mascot Distiller software (version 2.5.1.0, Matrix Science Ltd.).

To allow identification and quantification of acetylated N-terminal peptides, a quantitation method with two different components was made defining light (12C2H3) and heavy (13C2D3) acetylation of peptide N-termini as respectively light and heavy exclusive modification groups. Only peptides that were ranked first and scored above the threshold score set at 99% confidence were withheld. In a second search, peptides without N-terminal acetylation were identified using a similar search parameter set, including the cyclization of N-terminal glutamine residues to pyroglutamine residues as a variable modification.

Shotgun proteomic analysis on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer facilitated the quantification of more than 3800 proteins, 250 of which displayed significant alternations (> 1.5 fold) upon arsenite treatment. Targeted analysis on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode confirmed the quantification results of some select proteins. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed the arsenite-induced alteration of more than 10 biological pathways, including the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway as reflected by the up-regulation of 9 proteins in this pathway. In addition, arsenite induced changes in expression levels of a number of selenoproteins and metallothioneins.

To mimic this situation for the study of underlying mechanisms we generated a cell model in which human SH-SH5Y neuroblastoma cells constitutively express NOS1 at a level comparable with the rodent brain, whereas the control cells have only low levels. SH-SY5Y cells are the most widely used cell model for neurodegenerative and aging research. They were stably transduced with a lentiviral vector for NOS1 and FACS sorted. Control cells were transduced with the backbone vector, referred to as MOCK or ""WT-LV205"".  Neuronal aging of SH-SY5Y can be imposed with a number of pharmacological, genetic or stress stimuli including retinoic acid and repeated cycles of starvation.

PXD006900,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006900,Bacterial pore-forming toxins remodel the host epithelial cell proteome,"Bacterial pathogens use various strategies to interfere with host cell functions. Among these strategies, bacteria induce transcriptional changes, in order to modify the set of proteins synthetized by the host cell, or target pre-existing proteins by modulating their post-translational modifications or by triggering their degradation. Protein levels variations in host cells during infection integrates both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations induced by pathogens. Here, we focused on host proteome alterations induced by the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and more specifically the Listeria toxin Listeriolysin O (LLO).  In order to characterize host proteome alterations induced by LLO, we performed a shotgun proteomics analysis on HeLa cells treated or not with the LLO toxin. To this end, we used SILAC labelling (stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture) to compared in a quantitative manner the protein content from two differentially treated cell populations: one control population and one population incubated with a sublytic dose of LLO (3 nM). We decided to expose cells to LLO during only 20 min to limit protein level changes resulting from transcriptional changes. We performed two independent experiments (experiment #1 and experiment #2) with swapped SILAC labelling to rule out putative labelling-dependent effects. A total of 2009 and 1684 proteins was quantified in each independent experiment, respectively, and 1360 proteins were quantified in both experiments. Among these 1360 proteins, we identified a total of 91 proteins for which protein levels were consistently decreased in cells treated with LLO (i.e. with a log2 control/LLO ratio >0.5 in both experiments). To assess whether the host proteasome was involved in the decrease of these 91 proteins, we repeated our proteomics analysis on SILAC-labelled HeLa cells pre-treated with proteasome inhibitors before exposure to LLO. Two independent experiments were similarly performed with swapped SILAC labelling (experiment #3 and experiment #4). Interestingly, we observed that the vast majority of host proteins identified as strongly downregulated in response to LLO also displayed significant decreased levels in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that the majority of observed decreases in host protein levels induced by LLO are not due to proteasome-mediated degradation. In follow-up experiments, we identified that LLO decreases in particular the protein level of two E2 ubiquitin enzymes, UBE2K and UBE2N, leading to major changes in the host ubiquitylome. This toxin-induced proteome remodeling involves post-transcriptional regulations, as no modification in the transcription levels of the corresponding genes was observed. These decreases in host protein levels were observed in different epithelial cell lines but not in macrophages. In addition, we could show that Perfringolysin O, another bacterial pore-forming toxin similar to LLO, also induces host proteome changes. Taken together, our data show that different bacterial pore-forming toxins induce deep proteome remodeling, that may impair host epithelial cell functions.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","listeria infection, pore-forming toxin, SILAC, listeriolysin O","Data analysis was performed with MaxQuant (version 1.5.6.5) using the Andromeda search engine with default search settings including a false discovery rate set at 1% on both the peptide and protein level.

Ultracentrifugation, the most frequently used EV isolation technique, requires specialized equipment and provides relatively low purity and yield. A more recently applied and easily accessible EV isolation technique is size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Here, we hypothesized that EVs isolated from dilute cell culture media by concentration on a 10 kDa filter followed by SEC are suitable for proteomic and functional studies. We also hypothesized that the protein-rich SEC fractions are suitable controls to assess biological effects of the non-EV associated secretome. Cell-depleted medium from BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells (60 ml) was 0.22 µm filtered, concentrated to 0.5 ml by 10 kDa UF and run over a sepharose CL-4B column. Fractions were assessed for protein and EV content. EV-rich and protein-rich fractions were concentrated by 10 kDa UF. EV concentrates were characterized by tuneable resistive pulse sensing, cryo transmission electron microscopy and nanoLC-MS/MS. Finally, we assessed the effect of EVs or free secreted protein from unexposed cells or cells exposed to 1% (v/v) cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on IL-8 release by naïve BEAS-2B cells or on adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to endothelial cells. UF concentrated the EVs with approximately 100% recovery. Most of EVs eluted in SEC fractions 6-11, while protein became detectable at fraction 12. The final EV recovery was 40 ± 4%, as compared to 27 ± 8% by ultracentrifugation. Mass Spectrometry of the EV fractions identified 388 different proteins, including various EV markers. Only the protein, but not the EV fractions from media of CSE-exposed cells induced IL-8 release by naïve bronchial epithelial cells, whereas only EVs, but not the protein fractions induced THP-1 adhesion to endothelial cells.

For data dependent analysis, the library of 4783 SOMAmer®s were multiplexed in sets of 8 and used for enrichment of target proteins from cell lysate and conditioned media, as well as human plasma and serum.  A subset of the SOMAmer®s were screened in urine by this global profiling technique as well.  Cell lines were selected from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia for screening by comparing gene expression of the target proteins measured by RNA sequencing across the CCLE.1  Using the criterion of FPKM value greater than 5 for the target protein, the minimum number of cell lines was grown to maximize protein coverage across the SOMAmer® library.  For a given cell line, the presence of at least 8 target proteins with FPKM values greater than 5was required for inclusion.  Approximately 400 target proteins were not covered by this strategy were screened in serum and plasma only.  For enrichment from biological matrices, SOMAmer®s were combined into sets of 8 such that the potential interaction with similar proteins or binding partners was minimized.  Non-specific binding of the SOMAmer®s was assessed in each matrix by using a SOMAmer® generated against the bacterial protein CysH.  Target protein spectral counts in the SOMAmer® enriched samples were compared to the respective CysH control.  A positive hit is defined as target protein detection with a minimum of 2 spectral counts and signal over CysH background greater than 10X (if applicable).","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood plasma"",""cell culture"",""urine"",""blood serum"",""cell suspension culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos"",""Q Exactive""]","[""Technical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Blood serum, blood plasma, cell lysate, conditioned media, aptamer, SOMAmer","The data were searched using Uniprot Human canonical database (v Jan 2014) with common contaminants and reverse database appended (43136 sequences; 23452844 residues).

In HeLa cells, GA inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis, as showed by results of MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis. Possible target-related proteins of GA were searched using comparative proteomic analysis (2-DE) and 9 proteins at early (3 h) stage together with 9 proteins at late (24 h) stage were found. Vimentin was the only target-related protein found at both early and late stage. Results of both 2-DE analysis and Western blotting assay suggested cleavage of vimentin induced by GA. MS/MS analysis of cleaved vimentin peptides indicated possible cleavage sites of vimentin at or near aa51 and aa425. Results of targeted proteomic analysis showed that GA induced change in phosphorylation state of the vimentin head domain (aa51-64). Caspase inhibitors could not abrogate GA-induced cleavage of vimentin. Over-expression of vimentin ameliorated cytotoxicity of GA in HeLa cells. The GA-activated signal transduction, from p38 MAPK, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), vimentin, dysfunction of cytoskeleton, to cell death, was predicted and then confirmed. Results of animal study showed that GA treatment inhibited tumor growth in HeLa tumor-bearing mice and cleavage of vimentin could be observed in tumor xenografts of GA-treated animals. Results of immunohistochemical staining also showed down-regulated vimentin level in tumor xenografts of GA-treated animals. Furthermore, compared with cytotoxicity of GA in HeLa cells, cytotoxicity of GA in MCF-7 cells with low level of vimentin was weaker while cytotoxicity of GA in MG-63 cells with high level of vimentin was stronger. These results indicated the important role of vimentin in the cytotoxicity of GA. The effects of GA on vimentin and other epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers provided suggestion for better usage of GA in clinic.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""}]","[""4700 Proteomics Analyzer""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]","[""Peptide counting""]","gambogic acid, anti-cancer, proteomics, vimentin","A two-tailed Student's t test was performed to perform quantitative analysis between protein gels from control and GA-treated group.

Since IDRs lack a fixed three-dimensional structure, the molecular mechanism by which such mutations cause disease is often unknown. Here, we employ a peptide-based proteomic screen to investigate the impact of mutations in IDRs on protein-protein interactions. We find that mutations in disordered cytosolic regions of three transmembrane proteins (GLUT1, ITPR1 and CACNA1H) lead to an increased binding of clathrin. In all three cases, the mutation creates a dileucine motif known to mediate clathrin-dependent trafficking. Follow-up experiments on full length GLUT1 (SLC2A1), the glucose transporter causative of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, revealed that the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments in a model cell line and in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Mutant GLUT1 interacts with adaptor proteins (APs) in vitro, and knocking-down AP-2 reverts the cellular mislocalization. A systematic analysis of other known disease-causing variants revealed a significant and specific overrepresentation of gained dileucine motifs in structurally disordered cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins. Thus, several mutations in disordered regions appear to cause “dileucineopathies”.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""SRM/MRM"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","PRM,Glut1, Dileucin,disordered regions","RawFiles were analyzed with MaxQuant with the following settings: Multiplicity 2, with Lys8 and Arg10 set as heavy; carbamidomethylation as fixed modification; oxidation(M) and nterminal acyetylation as variable modification; Protein FDR 0.01; Peptide FDR 0.01.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and downstream JAK/STAT signaling are thought to be central components of these microenvironment-induced phenotypes. In a prior drug repurposing screen, we identified tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor FDA-approved for rheumatoid arthritis, as an agent that may reverse the tumor-stimulating effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells.Here, we validated both in vitro, in stromal-responsive human myeloma cell lines, and in vivo, in orthotopic disseminated murine xenograft models of myeloma, that tofacitinib showed both single-agent and combination therapeutic efficacy in myeloma models.  Surprisingly, we found that ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved agent targeting JAK1 and JAK2, did not lead to the same anti-myeloma effects.  Combination with a novel irreversible JAK3-selective inhibitor also did not rescue ruxolitinib effects. RNA-seq and unbiased phosphoproteomics revealed that marrow stromal cells drive a JAK/STAT-mediated proliferative program in myeloma plasma cells, and tofacitinib reversed the large majority of these pro-growth signals. Taken together, our results suggest that tofacitinib specifically reverses the growth-promoting effects of the tumor microenvironment through blocking an IL-6-mediated signaling axis. As tofacitinib is already FDA-approved, these results can be rapidly translated into potential clinical benefits for myeloma patients.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""Q Exactive Plus""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","human, myeloma, tofacitinib, bone marrow microenvironment,  LC-MSMS, LFQ","Raw mass spectrometry data for two biological replicates were processed using Maxquant versus the Swissprot human proteome, with phospho (STY) selected as a fixed modification and match between runs enabled.

Strikingly, heterozygous loss of function mutations in SALL4 result in a human developmental condition that phenocopies thalidomide induced birth defects such as absence of thumbs, phocomelia, defects in ear and eye development, and congenital heart disease. We find that thalidomide induces degradation of SALL4 exclusively in humans, primates and rabbits, but not in rodents or fish, providing a mechanistic link for the species-specific pathogenesis of thalidomide syndrome.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","IMiDs, thalidomide, ubiquitin, cullin, crl4","Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher) was used for .RAW file processing and controlling peptide and protein level false discovery rates, assembling proteins from peptides, and protein quantification from peptides.

Loss of VHL in renal tumors also differs from tumors of other organs in that the oncogenic cascade is mediated by an increase in the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF2alpha) instead of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha).        MS/MS data generated by data dependent acquisition via the LTQ-FT were extracted by BioWorks version 3.3 and searched against a composite IPI human protein sequence database (IPI _human_v 3.73.par)  containing both forward and randomized sequences using Mascot version 2.2 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) search algorithm. Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.80 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 15.0 ppm assuming trypsin as the digestion enzyme with the possibility of one missed cleavage. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification, while oxidation of methionine, N-terminal protein acetylation, N-terminal peptide and lysine carbamoylation, and phosphorylation of serine and threonine were specified as variable modifications. The analysis of VHL-wt (Caki-2) human RCC and VHL-mut (786-O) cells was carried out from three independent, biological samples from each cell line (tryptic digests of Caki-2 and 786-O, respectively) and duplicate injections were made for each sample. Data processing was accomplished using two software tools: Scaffold (version Scaffold 3.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) and Progenesis LC-MS (version 3.0, Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, NC). Scaffold was employed to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications from Mascot database searching. Initial peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm [20]. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm [21]. Protein identifications were accepted, if they reached greater than 99% probability and contained at least 2 identified unique peptides. These identification criteria typically established < 0.01% false discovery rate based on a decoy database search strategy at the protein level.        Extracted peptide intensities were evaluated with Progenesis LC-MS to obtain label-free relative quantification from the raw data files. The software created a single aggregate run based on LC retention time of each analysis to contain all MS data with distinguished peptide ions and, then, further feature outline maps were generated for detection and quantification of peptide ions from individual analyses using default program parameters. Peptide quantifications were performed by summing peak intensities followed by normalization, data filtering to retain only ions with positive charges (z) of two and three, and exporting peak lists to query against the IPI human protein sequence database using Mascot (see Database Search subsection above). Proteins were accepted as differentially expressed following analysis of variance (ANOVA, P<0.05), requiring at least a twofold change in expression and also passing validation by Peptide Prophet and Protein Prophet using protein identifications from Scaffold.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""instrument model""]",,"[""Bottom-up proteomics""]",,"Human, VHL, Cancer, HIF-2a, LC-MS/MS",Not available,2013-07-10,"[[""PMID:23940778"",""DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0071654""]]"

ATRA inhibits APL, breast and liver cancers by targeting isomerase Pin1, a master regulator of oncogenic signaling. Here we show that ATO targets Pin1 and cooperates with ATRA to exert potent anticancer activity. ATO inhibits and degrades Pin1, and suppresses its oncogenic function by noncovalent binding to Pin1’s active site. ATRA increases cellular ATO uptake through upregulating aquaporin-9. ATO and ATRA, at clinically safe doses, cooperatively ablate Pin1 to block numerous cancer-driving pathways and inhibit the growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells and tumor-initiating cells in cell and animal models including patient-derived orthotopic xenografts, similar to Pin1 CRISPR knockout, which is substantiated by comprehensive protein and microRNA analyses.

It is reasonable to assume that inter-individual variation in protein phosphorylation may underlie phenotypic differences, as has been observed for practically any other molecular regulatory phenotype. However, we do not know much about the extent of inter-individual variation in phosphorylation because it is quite challenging to perform a quantitative high throughput study to assess inter-individual variation in any post-translational modification. To test our ability to address this challenge with current technology, we quantified phosphorylation levels for three fully sequenced human cell lines within a nested experimental framework, and found that genetic background is the primary determinant of phosphoproteome variation. We uncovered multiple functional, biophysical, and genetic associations with germline driven phosphopeptide variation (though the small sample size in this ‘pilot’ study limits the applicability of our genetic observations). Among these associations were variants affecting protein levels or structure, with the latter presenting, on average, a stronger effect. Interestingly, we found evidence that is consistent with a phosphopeptide variability buffering effect endowed from properties enriched within longer proteins. We also undertook a thorough technical assessment of our experimental workflow to aid further efforts. Taken together, this work provides the foundation for future work to characterize inter-individual variation in post-translational modification as well as reveals novel insights into the nature of inter-individual variation in phosphorylation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","Human, YRI, LCL, LC-MS/MS, MaxQuant","MS data was analyzed with MaxQuant [46] 1.5.0.30 and the Adromeda [47] search engine.

PXD010783,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010783,C16-ceramide is a natural regulatory ligand of p53 in cellular stress response,"Ceramides are important participants of signal transduction, regulating fundamental cellular processes. Here we report the mechanism for activation of p53 tumor suppressor by C16-ceramide.  C16-ceramide tightly binds within the p53 DNA binding domain (Kd ~ 60 nM), in close vicinity to the Box V motif. This interaction is highly selective towards the ceramide acyl chain length with its C10 atom being proximal to Ser240 and Ser241. Ceramide binding stabilizes p53 and disrupts its complex with E3 ligase MDM2 leading to the p53 accumulation, nuclear translocation and activation of the downstream targets. This is a novel physiological mechanism of p53 activation, which is fundamentally different from the canonical p53 regulation through protein-protein interactions or post-translational modifications. The discovered mechanism is triggered by serum or folate deprivation implicating it in the cellular response to nutrient/metabolic stress.  Our study establishes C16-ceramide as the first natural small molecule activating p53 through the direct binding.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biological""]","[""Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]",,"p52, ceramide, regulatory ligand","The .raw data files were analyzed by PEAKS Studio 7.5 proteomics database search engine to identify modifications present in peptides, using the following mass-differences for: carbamidomethylation – 57.02 Da, oxidation – 15.99 Da, photoactivated ceramide - 518.46 Da.",2018-08-15,"[[""DOI:10.1038/s41467-018-06650-y"",""PMID:30297838""]]"

Recycling of endocytosed Wntless requires the sorting nexin-3 (SNX3)-retromer-dependent endosome-to-Golgi transport pathway. Here we demonstrate the essential role of SNX3-retromer assembly for Wntless transport and report that SNX3 associates with an evolutionary conserved endosome-associated membrane re-modelling complex composed of MON2, DOPEY2 and the putative aminophospholipid translocase, ATP9A. In vivo suppression of Ce-mon-2, Ce-pad-1 or Ce-tat-5 (respective MON2, DOPEY2 and ATP9A orthologues) phenocopy a loss of SNX3-retromer function, leading to enhanced lysosomal degradation of Wntless and a Wnt phenotype. Perturbed Wnt signalling is also observed upon overexpression of an ATPase-inhibited TAT-5(E246Q) mutant, suggesting a role for phospholipid flippase activity during SNX3-retromer-mediated Wntless sorting. Together, these findings provide in vitro and in vivo mechanistic details to describe SNX3-retromer-mediated transport during Wnt secretion and the formation of Wnt-morphogenic gradients.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""6x(13)C labeled residue"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]",,"[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]",retromer flippase snx3,"Xcalibar v2.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to acquire the MS data.

Understanding these mechanisms and developing biomarkers to identify their presence thus represents a vital goal. Towards this goal, here we report a chemoproteomic map of the covalent targets of fumarate, an oncometabolite whose accumulation marks the genetic cancer predisposition syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC). First, we validate the ability of known and novel chemoproteomic probes to report on concentration-dependent fumarate reactivity in vitro. Next, we apply these probes in concert with LC-MS/MS to identify cysteine residues sensitive to either fumarate treatment or fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation in untransformed and HLRCC cell models, respectively. Mining this data to understand the structural determinants of fumarate reactivity led to the discovery of an unexpected anti-correlation with nucleophilicity, indicating a novel influence of pH on fumarate-cysteine interactions. Finally, we show that many fumarate-sensitive and FH-regulated cysteines are found in functional protein domains, and perform functional studies of a fumarate-sensitive cysteine in SMARCC1 that lies at a key protein-protein interface in the SWI-SNF tumor suppressor complex. Our studies provide a powerful resource for understanding the influence of fumarate on reactive cysteine residues, and lay the foundation for future efforts to exploit this distinct aspect of oncometabolism for cancer diagnosis and therapy.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""kidney""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"UOK262, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC), Fumarate hydratase (FH), Fumarate, Succination, Cysteine reactivity, LC-MSMS","The tandem MS data was analyzed by the SEQUEST algorithm.

However, their correlation has not been clarified. In this study, human atrial tissues from the patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease in either sinus rhythm or persistent AF were analyzed using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach. An up-regulation in chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) 1, 4, 5 and a rise in type IV collagen were revealed. Combined with the results from immunohistochemistry and electron microscope analysis, the distribution of type IV collagen and effects of fibrosis on myocyte membrane indicated the possible interaction between CLIC and type IV collagen, confirmed by protein structure prediction and co-immunoprecipitation. These results indicate that CLICs play an important role in the development of atrial fibrillation and that CLICs and structural type IV collagen may interact on each other to promote the development of AF in rheumatic mitral valve disease.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""heart""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"human, heart, iTRAQ,","Raw data files acquired from the Orbitrap were converted into MGF files using Proteome Discoverer 1.2 (PD 1.2, Thermo),[5600 msconverter] and the MGF file were searched.

Here, we combined cultivation-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics to investigate the functional maturation of gut microbiota in faecal samples from full-term healthy infants collected at 6 and 18 months of age. Phylogenetic analysis of the metaproteomes showed that Bifidobacterium provided the highest number of distinct protein groups. Considerable divergences between taxa abundance and protein phylogeny were observed at all taxonomic ranks. Age had a profound effect on early microbiota where compositional and functional complexity of less dissimilar communities increased with time. Comparisons of the relative abundances of proteins revealed the transition of taxon-associated saccharolytic and carbon metabolism strategies from catabolic pathways of milk and mucin-derived monosaccharides feeding acetate/propanoate synthesis to complex food sugars fuelling butyrate production. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis uncovered two anti-correlated modules of functional taxa. A low-connected Bifidobacteriaceae-centred guild of facultative anaerobes was succeeded by a rich club of obligate anaerobes densely interconnected around Lachnospiraceae, underpinning their pivotal roles in microbial ecosystem assemblies.

Hereby we describe the identification of a phosphorylation on the serine 95, located at the GLS N-terminus, a domain shared by both isoforms. A GAC phosphomimetic mutant (S95D) ectopically expressed in breast cancer cells presented decreased enzymatic activity, and its expression impacted on cell’s glutamine uptake, glutamate release and intracellular glutamate levels (compared to expressing wild type GAC) without changing GAC sub-cellular localization. Curiously, replacing S95 by an alanine in the ectopically expressed GAC (S95A) increased cell proliferation and migration.

Recent advances in mass spectrometric (MS) proteome quantification techniques, exemplified by SWATH-MS, a massively parallel targeting method, now also support precise quantitative proteomic comparisons across multiple samples, thus identifying molecular and implied functional differences.   Here we used SWATH-MS to analyze the proteome profiles of a set of fresh-frozen prostate tissue samples derived from radical prostatectomy specimens. A high confidence set of 1,906 proteins were consistently quantified across 60 biopsy-level tissue samples from three prostatectomy patients, each consisting of 1.0 mm punch biopsies from histologically malignant (acinar and ductal adenocarcinoma) and matching benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues.  The quantitative protein profiles allowed independent quantification of the degree of intra-tumor heterogeneity for each protein in benign and malignant tissues. We found that while majority of the proteins showed comparably low intra-tumor variability, 122 proteins were highly variable in malignant and/or matching benign tissues. We observed that proteins that varied between patients or tissue types also tended to be highly variable within prostate tissues,  suggesting that these variability patterns will be a critical selection criterion in future protein biomarker studies. The data also permitted investigation of the heterogeneity of multiple biochemical pathways. The high variability of several of the pathways, including Glypican-1 network, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and celecoxib pathway, explained contradictory results regarding them in the literature.  In conclusion, we demonstrated a methodology for investigating proteomic intra-tumor heterogeneity from biopsy-level tissue samples, and quantified the degree of intra-tumor heterogeneity of 1,906 proteins in prostate tumors.

Serological biomarkers to predict and diagnose PE would help antenatal care and reduce the obstetrical complications. To discover biomarkers for prediction of PE, we first performed global proteome profiling of three pairs of maternal plasma samples obtained from the early second trimester pregnant women who subsequently developed PE and controls to identify proteins that were abundant in the patients. We further evaluated the expression changes of PE representing proteins in stored plasma samples of a cohort of subsequently developed PE and their matched controls by MRM assay. We identified both Complement C1s subcomponent (p-value = 0.041) and Protein AMBP (p-value = 0.043) were up-regulated in the cohort of PE plasma samples before manifestation of clinical disease.

Here, we report the discovery of deubiquitinating activity in ZUFSP/C6orf113. High-resolution crystal structures of ZUFSP in complex with ubiquitin reveal several distinctive features of ubiquitin recognition and catalysis. Our analyses reveal that ZUFSP is a novel DUB with no homology to any known DUBs, leading us to classify ZUFSP as the seventh DUB family. Intriguingly, the minimal catalytic domain does not cleave polyubiquitin. We identify two new ubiquitin binding domains in ZUFSP: a ZHA (ZUFSP helical arm) that binds to the distal ubiquitin and an atypical UBZ domain in ZUFSP that binds to polyubiquitin. Importantly, both domains are essential for ZUFSP to selectively cleave K63-linked polyubiquitin. We show that ZUFSP localizes to DNA lesions, where it plays an important role in genome stability pathways, functioning to prevent spontaneous DNA damage and also promote cellular survival in response to exogenous DNA damage.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","Deubiquitinase, Ubiquitin binding domain, DNA damage","MS data were analyzed with MaxQuant (1.6.0.13) (Cox and Mann, 2008).

High-resolution mass spectrometry and unrestricted data processing confirmed that serine residues are the major target of ADP-ribosylation in HeLa cells. Proteome-wide analyses identified 3,090 serine ADP-ribosylation sites, with 97 percent of acceptor sites modulated more than 2-fold upon oxidative stress, while treatment with PARP inhibitor Olaparib abrogates induction (part 1, ADP-ribosylation data, PXD009208). Consistent with the nuclear expression of ARTD1/PARP1 and ARTD2/PARP2, serine ADP-ribosylation prominently occurred on nuclear proteins. Structural-predictive analyses revealed that serine ADP-ribosylation preferentially resides in disordered regions, and identified serine ADP-ribosylation sites to significantly overlap with known phosphorylation sites. Large-scale phosphoproteomics analysis supported these observations (part 2, phosphorylation data), hereby providing first evidence for site-specific crosstalk between serine ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation.

Multivariate analysis of a subset of these (n=50) was applied to identify novel biomarkers, which were validated in a second subset (n=49). In the discovery cohort, a panel of five proteins was sufficient to distinguish control from IBD-affected tissue biopsies with an AUC of 1.0 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.0); a second panel of 12 proteins segregated inflamed CD from UC within an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.0). Application of the two panels to the validation cohort resulted in accurate classification of 95.9% (IBD from control) and 80% (CD from UC) of patients. 116 proteins were identified to have correlation with the severity of disease, four of which were components of the two panels, including visfatin and metallothionein-2.

The MaxQuant output protein group file was imported into Perseus (version 1.3.0.4) for data filtering, log2 transformation, basic statistical analysis (ANOVA, T-test, Pearson correlation, hierarchical clustering) of the normalized ratios versus SILAC reference cell lysates, and for protein group annotation (KEGG, GOBP, Keywords). Only proteins that were quantified by 2 or more unique peptides were included in further analyses. The variance for each biopsy proteome was calculated, and Robust regression and Outlier (ROUT 4) applied in Prism (Graphpad) to identify any biopsies for which the variance, and thus the MS quality of the data, are significantly different from the population. Outliers were removed prior to statistical analysis.  To ensure consistency of the MS data over time, the patterns of relative expression of proteins within all biopsy proteomes were compared. To avoid inherent issues associated with MS undersampling5, or sample preparation variation, the top 25% most abundant proteins were identified by total intensity, and the log2 ratios of these were evaluated by heat map and hierarchical clustering. Pearson correlation between all proteomes was performed (Perseus) to ensure no gross proteomic differences were apparent between samples.  The entire proteome was segregated for subgroup analysis in Excel (Microsoft). Proteins with a relative contribution to protein ID by a given subgroup was determined, and those proteins that represent > 70% of the relative contribution and having identification in <50% of subgroup biopsies were considered to be potentially relevant and included in all further analyses (“subgroup specific”). Data sets with limited immunological proteins were created by removing all proteins that had the terms “immun” or “inflam” in the categories of GOBP, KEGG, Fasta, or Keyword. To evaluate proteins that are significantly different between non-IBD controls and IBD proteomes, sample data from CoA CD and UC biopsies were merged as the IBD group. The Q95 was calculated based upon each subgroup being analyzed, wherein proteins included were quantified in ≥95% of the biopsies for that analysis; the subgroup specific proteins were added to the Q95 for further processing. Missing value imputation and principle component analysis, using knnimpute and princomp respectively, were performed with MatLab.   To determine the minimum number of patients required for accurate diagnosis at the discovery stage, iterative analysis with Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analyses (PLSDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) was applied. It was determined that a minimum of 30 IBD subjects were required to ensure the greatest consistency in the accuracy of diagnosis (supplementary figure 4). Thus, a balanced stratification approach for gender and diagnosis (Etcetera in WinPepi, BrixtonHealth.ca) was applied for the random assignment of patient biopsies to either the discovery or validation cohort. After allocation, the Q95 and subgroup specific proteins of each cohort were determined.  The proteomics data from the discovery cohort was analyzed by PLSDA, SVM and RF in the ROC Explorer module of Roccet6 for candidate biomarker selection and testing. For each model, the performance is tested with repeated random sub-sampling cross validation with 2/3 of the samples used for training and 1/3 for testing, with 50 permutations.

CAR-expressing T (CAR-T) cells have demonstrated significant efficacy for the treatment of refractory B cell malignancies and are being evaluated as immunotherapeutic reagents for many other cancers. CAR designs are based on the fundamental principles of TCR recognition and most CARs employ the T cell-activating CD3z endodomain alongside a costimulatory domain from CD28 or 4-1BB. However, emerging data suggest that CD28/CD3z and 4-1BB/CD3z signaling modules promote divergent metabolic pathways, gene expression programs, and cell fates. To determine how CAR phosphoprotein signaling drives these disparate cell fates, we analyzed CAR ligation-induced signaling networks in primary human T cells using shotgun mass spectrometry. We isolated CD8+CD62L+ T cells from healthy donors and introduced a CD28/CD3z or 4-1BB/CD3z CAR by lentiviral transduction. Transduced T cells were purified by FACS and expanded once in vitro. When the cells returned to a resting state, CD28/CD3z or 4-1BB/CD3z CAR-T cells were stimulated for 10 or 45 minutes with magnetic microbeads coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for a 9 amino acid tag in the CAR extracellular sequence.

Imatinib (gleevec, STI-571) is a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl activity highly effective in the treatment of CML. However, even though almost all CML patients respond to treatment with imatinib or third generation inhibitors. These drugs are not curative and need to be taken indefinitely or until patients become resistant. Therefore, to get a definitive eradication of leukemic cells, it is necessary to find novel therapeutic combinations, for achieving greater efficacy and fewer side effects.  Nutraceuticals play an increasingly important role in the treatment of cancer. Curcumin is an Indian spice with several therapeutic properties: anti-oxidant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and anti-cancer. In cancer disease, it acts by blocking cell transformation, proliferation, and invasion and by inducing cell apoptosis. In the present study, byapplying a quantitative proteomic SWATH-MS strategy we evaluated the effect of curcumin onK562 cells. Our findings revealed that the most relevant effect induced by curcumin was a consistent decrease of several proteins involved in glucose metabolism, most of which were HIF-1α targets, concomitant with the up-regulation of functional and structural mitochondrial proteins. The mechanism by which curcumin affects metabolic enzyme profile  was associated with the reduction of HIF-1α activity, due  to the miR-22-mediated down-regulation of importin 7 (IPO7) expression. Finally, the ability of curcumin to enhance in vitro the efficiency of imatinib was reported. In summary, our data indicates that the miR-22/IPO7/HIF-1α axis may be considered as a novel molecular target of curcumin adding new insights for better defining therapeutic activity and anticancer properties of this natural compound.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics"",""SWATH MS""]",,SWATH-MS; CML cells; curcumin,"The experimental design and workflow based on application of SWATH label-free proteomics quantitative technology are illustrated in Figure 1.

Upon binding viral DNA, the cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) catalyzes the production of cyclic dinucleotides to induce type I interferons. However, little is known about how cGAS is homeostatically maintained or regulated upon infection. Here, we define cytoplasmic cGAS interactions with cellular and viral proteins upon herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) infection in primary human fibroblasts. We compare several HSV-1 strains (wild-type, d109, d106) that induce cytokine responses and apoptosis, and place cGAS interactions in the context of temporal proteome alterations using isobaric-labeling mass spectrometry. Follow-up analyses establish a functional interaction between cGAS and 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthase-like protein OASL. The OAS-like domain interacts with the cGAS Mab21 domain, while the OASL ubiquitin-like domain further inhibits cGAS-mediated interferon response. Our findings explain how cGAS may be inactively maintained in cellular homeostasis, with OASL functioning as a negative feedback loop for cytokine induction.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap"",""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT"",""Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor - NSAF""]","cGAS, IP-MS, TMT, OASL, interactions, DNA sensing",MS/MS data were searched using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 or 2.2.

Mice with MGME1 deficiency accumulate a long linear subgenomic mtDNA species, similar to the one found in mtDNA mutator mice, but do not develop progeria.

However, the substrates and mechanisms involved in this pathway of error correction remain poorly understood. Using a chemically tuned kinetochore-targeting assay, we show that Mps1 destabilizes microtubule attachments (K-fibers) epistatically to Aurora B, the other major error-correcting kinase. Through chemical genetics and quantitative proteomics, we identify both known and novel sites of Mps1- regulated phosphorylation at the outer kinetochore. Modification of these substrates was sensitive to microtubule tension and counterbalanced by the PP2A-B56 phosphatase, a positive regulator of chromosome-spindle interactions. Consistently, Mps1 inhibition rescued K-fiber stability after depleting PP2A-B56. We also identify the hinge region of the W-shaped Ska complex as a key effector of Mps1 at the kinetochore-microtubule interface, as mutations that mimic constitutive phosphorylation strongly destabilized K-fibers in vivo and inhibited the Ska complex’s conversion from lattice diffusion to end-coupled microtubule binding in vitro. Together these results provide new insights into how Mps1 modulates the microtubule-binding properties of the kinetochore to promote the selective stabilization of bipolar attachments and error-free chromosome segregation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Chemical genetics, proteomics, Spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), Mps1, PP2A-B56, Ska complex","All raw files acquired in this study were collectively processed with the MaxQuant software suite (version 1.0.13.13), which performs peak list generation, SILAC-based quantification, estimation of false discovery rates, peptide to protein group assembly, and phosphorylation site localization as described previously (Cox and Mann, 2008; Oppermann et al., 2012).

Here we report the specific binding of zinc finger protein ZNF768 to the sequence motif GCTGTGTG (N20) CCTCTCTG in the core region of MIRs. ZNF768 binding is preferentially associated with euchromatin and promoter regions of genes.  Binding was observed for genes expressed in a cell type-specific manner in human B cell line Raji and osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Mass spectrometric analysis of ZNF768 associated proteins revealed binding of ZNF768 to Elongator subunits 1, 2, and 3. The N-terminus of ZNF768 contains a heptad repeat array structurally related to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. This array evolved in placental animals but not marsupials and monotreme species, displays species-specific length variations, and possibly fulfills CTD related functions in gene regulation. We propose that the evolution of MIRs and ZNF768 has extended the repertoire of gene regulatory mechanisms in mammals and that ZNF768 binding is associated with cell type-specific gene expression.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Zinc finger protein, heptad-repeats, mammalian interspersed repeats, gene regulation, placentalia, Elongator","MaxQuant 1.5.2.8 was used to identify proteins and quantify by iBAQ with the following parameters: Database, Uniprot_Hsapiens_3AUP000005640_170526; MS tol, 10ppm; MS/MS tol, 0.5 Da; Peptide FDR, 0.1; Protein FDR, 0.01 Min. peptide Length, 5; Variable modifications, Oxidation (M); Fixed modifications, Carbamidomethyl (C); Peptides for protein quantitation, razor and unique; Min. peptides, 1; Min. ratio count, 2.

Here we use crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to chart the interactome of intact human nuclei. We overall identified ~8700 crosslinks, of which 2/3 represent links connecting distinct proteins. From this data we constructed an overview of the nuclear interactome. We observed that the histone proteins on the nucleosomes expose well-defined crosslinking hot-spots. For several nucleosome-interacting proteins, such as USF3 and Ran GTPase, the data allowed us to build models of their binding mode to the nucleosome. For HMGN2 the data guided the construction of a refined model of the interaction with the nucleosome, based on complementary NMR, XL-MS and modeling. Excitingly, several isoform-specific interactors seem to exist for distinct histone H1 variants and the analysis of crosslinks carrying post-translational modifications allowed us to extract how specific modifications influence the nucleosome interactome.

PXD011033,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD011033,HEK293 femtomolar GPCR signaling,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of cell surface signaling proteins; they participate in all physiological processes and are the targets of 30% of marketed drugs. Typically, nanomolar-micromolar concentrations of ligand are used to activate GPCRs in experimental systems. However, by measuring cAMP with increased spatial and temporal resolution, we can now detect GPCR responses to an extraordinarily wide range of ligand concentrations: from attomolar to millimolar. Mathematical modeling shows that the addition of femtomolar concentrations of ligand can activate a significant proportion of cells provided that a cell can be activated by 1-2 binding events. In addition to cAMP, activation of the endogenous b2-adrenoceptor (b2AR) and muscarinic M3R by femtomolar concentrations of ligand in cell lines and human cardiac fibroblasts causes sustained increases in nuclear ERK or cytosolic PKC, respectively. These responses are spatially and temporally distinct from those that occur at higher concentrations of ligand, and result in a unique proteomic profile. This highly sensitive signaling is dependent on the GPCRs forming pre-assembled higher-order signaling complexes at the plasma membrane. Recognizing that GPCRs respond to ultra-low concentrations of neurotransmitters and hormones challenges established paradigms of drug action and provides a new dimension of GPCR activation that is quite distinct from that typically observed.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""alkylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""37""},{""ptm"":""2x(13)C""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""ICAT""]","femtomolar, highly sensitive, ultra-low, GPCR, cAMP, compartmentalized signaling, b2AR, M3R, signaling complex","Protein identification and quantification was performed using MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.17).

In order to obtain accurate data, we evaluated the use of two different stable isotopes of the same peptide as spike-in for absolute quantification. For this purpose, peptide labeling by reductive amination was applied, which is a mild reaction for dimethylation of amine groups with very high yield and very little side reactions. Furthermore, three different forms can be generated with e.g., light and heavy labels for spike-in peptides, and medium label for endogenous peptides. The addition of the dimethylated proteotypic peptide in two different versions allows to determine the accuracy of the quantification of endogenous peptides using the relative ratio of the intensities of the two internal standards. The method was studied with peptides of apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B-100, and leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein without and with serum. In serum, the endogenous protein concentrations were accurately measured across four orders of magnitude by the two-point quantitation method. Less than 20% of coefficient of variation (CV) values and strong correlation with R2 of 0.99 across three analytical replicates was observed. The results showed that the accuracy to determine the amount of endogenous peptides can be validated using two references against each other, which cannot be obtained by one-point quantitation. Because of the significant lower costs than synthetic stable isotopically labeled peptides, this approach might be particularly interesting for the absolute quantitation of multiple proteins.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood serum""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Q Exactive""]",,"[""SRM/MRM""]",,"absolute quantitation, dimethylation; mass spectrometry, parallel reaction monitoring, targeted proteomics","All raw files were converted to mgf files and searched against the human Swiss-Prot database (Swiss-Prot, release 20160121, 20187 entries) using Mascot (version 2.4.0, Matrix Science, London, UK) with the following parameters: parent tolerance, 10 ppm; fragment tolerance: 0.05 Da; enzyme: trypsin; max missed cleavage: 1; variable modifications: dimethylation_heavy (N-terminal and lysine, 36.075670), dimethylation_light (N-terminal and lysine, 28.031300), and dimethylation_medium (N-terminal and lysine, 32.056407).

We purified endogenous ER using an approach termed RIME (rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins) and discovered the interactome under agonist- and antagonist-liganded conditions in breast cancer cells, revealing transcriptional networks in breast cancer. The most estrogen-enriched ER interactor is GREB1, a potential clinical biomarker with no known function. GREB1 is shown to be a chromatin-bound ER coactivator and is essential for ER-mediated transcription, because it stabilizes interactions between ER and additional cofactors. We show a GREB1-ER interaction in three xenograft tumors, and using a directed protein-protein approach, we find GREB1-ER interactions in half of ER+ primary breast cancers. This finding is supported by histological expression of GREB1, which shows that GREB1 is expressed in half of ER+ cancers, and predicts good clinical outcome. These findings reveal an unexpected role for GREB1 as an estrogen-specific ER cofactor that is expressed in drug-sensitive contexts.

Repeat expansions in C9ORF72, the major cause of ALS, reduce C9ORF72 levels but how this impacts stress granules is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that C9ORF72 associates with the autophagy receptor p62 and controls elimination of stress granules by autophagy. This requires p62 to associate via the Tudor protein SMN with proteins, including FUS, that are symmetrically arginine-methylated by PRMT5. Mice lacking p62 accumulate arginine-methylated proteins and alterations in FUS-dependent splicing.  Finally, patients with C9ORF72 repeat expansions accumulate symmetric arginine dimethylated proteins which co-localize with p62. This suggests that C9ORF72 initiates a cascade of ALS-linked proteins (C9ORF72, p62, SMN, FUS) to recognize stress granules for degradation by autophagy and hallmarks of a defect in this process are observable in ALS patients.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine"",""UNIMOD"":""36#R""},{""ptm"":""symmetric dimethyl-L-arginine"",""UNIMOD"":""36#R""},{""ptm"":""N6,N6-dimethyl-L-lysine"",""UNIMOD"":""36#K""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"SQSTM1, Oxidative Stress, ALS, LC-MSMS","The peak lists of the raw files were processed and analyzed with MaxQuant (Version 1.5.2.8) against UniProt human protein database, including commonly observed contaminants.

A subtype of cancer cells with stem-like properties, known as cancer stem cells (CSC) is thought to be responsible for tumour recurrence. These consequences are fatal for cancer patients as metastatic tumors are much more aggressive than the primary tumors from which they originate. Since both CSC and chemoresistant cancer cells may share common qualities and implicate involvement of mitochondria, drugs inducing mitochondrial dysfunction as for example, bactericidal antibiotics, may effectively suppress growth of cancer cells. In the current study, we demonstrate that CSC and chemoresistant cells derived from triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells display enrichment of up- and down-regulated proteins from metabolic pathways that suggest a direct link to mitochondria. Both cancer cell types (resistant cells and CSC) can be targeted by antibiotics, in particular, linezolid which decreases tumour growth rate by suppressing mitochondrial functions. As autophagy itself can “feed” cancer cells in their trial to reduce ROS induction by antibiotics, we propose that specific bactericidal antibiotics used in combination with autophagy blocker may suppress cancer cell proliferation and decrease tumour growth.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Cancer, Cancer stem cells, Therapy resistance, Antibiotics, Autophagy, ROS, LC-MS/MS","The analysis of the mass spectrometric RAW data files was carried out using the Proteome Discoverer software (Thermo Fisher Scientific; version 1.4) with in-house Mascot (Matrixscience, London, UK; version 2.6) and Sequest search engines utilisation.

They are largely met in high-flow rate chromatographic systems for small molecules but these are not sufficiently sensitive for proteomics applications. Here we describe a new concept that delivers on these requirements while maintaining the sensitivity of current nano-flow LC systems. Low-pressure pumps elute the sample from a disposable trap column, simultaneously forming a chromatographic gradient that is stored in a long storage loop. An auxiliary gradient creates an offset, ensuring the re-focusing of the peptides before the separation on the analytical column by a single high-pressure pump. This simplified design enables robust operation over thousands of sample injections. Furthermore, the steps between injections are performed in parallel, reducing overhead time to a few minutes and allowing analysis of more than 200 samples per day. From fractionated HeLa cell lysates, deep proteomes covering more than 130,000 sequence unique peptides and close to 10,000 proteins were rapidly acquired. Using this data as a library, we demonstrate quantitation of 5200 proteins in only 21 min.

This projected investigated molecular mechanisms of TEGDMA toxicity by identifying time- and dose dependent effects on the proteome of human THP-1 monocytes. Effects of different concentrations (0.07mM-5mM) and exposure times (0-72h) of TEGDMA on cell viability, proliferation, and morphology were determined by a real-time viability assay, automated cell counting, and electron microscopy, and laid the fundament for choice of exposure scenarios in the proteomic experiments. Cells were metabolically labelled (SILAC), and exposed to 0.3mM or 2.5mM TEGDMA for 6h or 16h prior to LC-MS/MS analyses. Regulated proteins were analysed with the STRING database. Cells exposed to 0.3mM TEGDMA showed increased viability, and time-dependent upregulation of proteins associated with stress/oxidative stress, autophagy, and cytoprotective functions. Cells exposed to 2.5mM TEGDMA showed diminished viability, and a protein expression profile associated with oxidative stress, DNA-damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell-cycle inhibition.

We identified numerous previously unknown C. trachomatis phosphoproteins and C. trachomatis-regulated host phosphoproteins that are substrates of kinases involved in various cellular processes. Interestingly, several host transcription factors (TFs) that are phosphorylated in C. trachomatis infections, including ETS2 repressor factor (ERF), proto-oncogenic transcription factor ETS1 are targets of ERK MAPK signaling. While these TFs were found to be essential for Chlamydia development, we demonstrated their involvement in inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in C. trachomatis infected cells by transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cellular motility and invasion.

However, there are conflicting results regarding the nature of exRNA. Here, we have separated two distinct exRNA profiles released by mast cells, here termed high-density (HD) and low-density (LD) exRNA. The exRNA in both fractions was characterized by microarray and next-generation sequencing. Both exRNA fractions contained mRNA and miRNA, and the mRNAs in the LD exRNA correlated closely with the cellular mRNA, whereas the HD mRNA did not. Furthermore, the HD exRNA was enriched in lincRNA, antisense RNA, vault RNA, snoRNA, and snRNA with little or no evidence of full-length 18S and 28S rRNA. The LD exRNA was enriched in mitochondrial rRNA, mitochondrial tRNA, tRNA, piRNA, Y RNA, and full-length 18S and 28S rRNA. The proteomes of the HD and LD exRNA-containing fractions were determined with LC-MS/MS and analysed with Gene Ontology term finder, which showed that both proteomes were associated with extracellular vesicles. Additionally, the proteins in the HD fractions tended to be associated with the nucleus and ribosomes, whereas the LD fraction proteome tended to be associated with the mitochondrion. We show that the two exRNA signatures released by a single cell type can be separated by floatation on a density gradient. These results show that cells can release multiple types of exRNA with substantial differences in RNA species content.

PXD011009,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD011009,Limits for resolving isobaric tandem mass tag reporter ions using phase constrained spectrum deconvolution,"A popular method for peptide quantification relies on isobaric labeling such as tandem mass tags (TMT) which enables multiplexed proteome analyses. Quantification is achieved by reporter ions generated by fragmentation in a tandem mass spectrometer. However, with higher degrees of multiplexing, the smaller mass differences between the reporter ions increase the mass resolving power requirements. This contrasts with faster peptide sequencing capabilities enabled by lowered mass resolution on Orbitrap instruments. It is therefore important to determine the mass resolution limits for highly multiplexed quantification when maximizing proteome depth. Here we defined the lower boundaries for resolving TMT reporter ions with 0.0063 Da mass differences using an ultra-high-field Orbitrap mass spectrometer. We found the optimal method depends on the relative ratio between closely spaced reporter ions and that 64 ms transient acquisition time provided sufficient resolving power for separating TMT reporter ions with absolute ratio changes up to 16-fold. Furthermore, a 32 ms transient processed with phase-constrained spectrum deconvolution provides >50% more identifications with >99% quantified, but with a slight loss in quantification precision and accuracy. These findings should guide decisions on what Orbitrap resolution settings to use in future proteomics experiments relying on isobaric TMT reporter ion quantification.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Q Exactive HF-X""]","[""Technical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","quantitative proteomics, tmt, resolution, Q Exactive HF-X, phase constrained spectrum deconvolution","All raw files were analyzed in one combined analysis using the MaxQuant software suite (version 1.6.1.2) with the integrated Andromeda search engine, where each raw file was configured as a separate experiment.24 For the search, fixed modifications were set to carbamylation of cysteines and TMT-10 were specified as label on N-terminal and lysines residues with mass tolerance set to 0.003 Da.

Mis-splicing of genes encoding pre-mRNA splicing proteins was limited to patient-specific retinal cells and Prpf31+/- mouse retinae and RPE. Mis-splicing of genes implicated in ciliogenesis and cellular adhesion was associated with severe RPE defects that include disrupted apical-basal polarity, reduced trans-epithelial resistance and phagocytic capacity, and decreased cilia length and incidence.

Finally, we validated ITGB3 by flow cytometry analysis of whole blood and histological staining of liver biopsies derived from patients diagnosed with Diclofenac-DILI.

Proteomic data analyses of the full-length protein sequences determined 9 N-glycosylation sites of hemagglutinin, and defined 6 N-glycosylation sites and the glycan structures of low abundance neuraminidase, which were occupied by high-mannose, hybrid and complex-type N-glycans. A total of ~300 glycopeptides were analyzed and manually validated by tandem mass spectrometry. The unique N-glycan structure and topological location of these N-glycans are highly correlated to the spatial protein structure and the residential ligand binding. Interestingly, sulfation, fucosylation and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine of N-glycans were also reliably identified at the specific glycosylation sites of the two influenza proteins that may serve a crucial role in regulating the protein structure and increasing the protein abundance of the influenza virus reassortants.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ FT""]","[""Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"",""Glycoproteomics (B/D-HPP)"",""Human Proteome Project""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Influenza H1N1, LC MS/MS",The raw LC MS/MS files from the data sets were acquired by Thermo LTQ-FT and Orbitrap Fusion,2017-07-13,"[[""PMID:28860626"",""DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-10714-2""]]"

PXD009760,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009760,A complex of C9ORF72 and p62 uses arginine methylation to eliminate stress granules by autophagy - PART 3,"Mutations in proteins like FUS which cause Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) result in the aberrant formation of stress granules while ALS-linked mutations in other proteins impede elimination of stress granules. Repeat expansions in C9ORF72, the major cause of ALS, reduce C9ORF72 levels but how this impacts stress granules is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that C9ORF72 associates with the autophagy receptor p62 and controls elimination of stress granules by autophagy. This requires p62 to associate via the Tudor protein SMN with proteins, including FUS, that are symmetrically arginine-methylated by PRMT5. Mice lacking p62 accumulate arginine-methylated proteins and alterations in FUS-dependent splicing.  Finally, patients with C9ORF72 repeat expansions accumulate symmetric arginine dimethylated proteins which co-localize with p62. This suggests that C9ORF72 initiates a cascade of ALS-linked proteins (C9ORF72, p62, SMN, FUS) to recognize stress granules for degradation by autophagy and hallmarks of a defect in this process are observable in ALS patients.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine"",""UNIMOD"":""36#R""},{""ptm"":""symmetric dimethyl-L-arginine"",""UNIMOD"":""36#R""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"FUS, PRMT5, Arginine Dimethylation, Oxidate Stress, ALS, LC-MSMS","The peak lists of the raw files were processed and analyzed with MaxQuant (Version 1.5.2.8) against UniProt human protein database, including commonly observed contaminants.

Amyloid deposits were isolated from two corneal specimens with atypical LCD type 1 due to a A546D/P551Q mutation in TGFBI using laser capture microdissection and a subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The findings were compared to the previous findings of a A546D LCD type 1 plaque proteome. Proteolytic processing of TGFBIp was addressed by counting peptide spectra obtained during the mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. Lastly, to study the effect of the P551Q substitution, recombinant FAS1-4 variants (wild type, A546D, A546D/P551Q, and P551Q) were expressed, purified and subjected to in vitro stability assays including circular dichroism, transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis, and limited proteolysis. Plaque proteomes of the two A546D/P551Q LCD type 1 cases were similar to each other as well as to A564D plaque proteome previously reported. Major proteins associated with the deposits were TGFBIp, serum amyloid P, clusterin, HtrA1, Apolipoproteins A-1, A-IV, D, and E. Proteolytic processing of TGFBIp were also similar in all LCD type 1 cases regardless of the mutation indicating that a C-terminal TGFBIp polypeptide had accumulated in the deposits. The stability assays revealed a minor destabilization of FAS1-4 upon the addition of the P551Q mutation, however, enough to result in different accessibility to proteolytic processing by trypsin for the A546D and A546D/P551Q FAS1-4 variants. Difference in A546D and A546D/P551Q LCD type 1 phenotypes is not ascribed to altered plaque formation or altered proteolytic processing of TGFBIp. Instead, a small decrease in thermodynamic stability introduced by the P551Q mutation is believed to affect TGFBIp fibrillation and proteolytic accessibility of TGFBIp, thereby resulting in the different phenotypes observed in vivo. *Data handling:* Raw data were converted to mgf format using Protein Pilot software (AB Sciex) and searched using an in-house Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version: 2.3.02) against the Swiss-Prot database (version: 2012_05). Enzyme was set to semi-trypsin, and missed cleavage was 1. No fixed modifications were added. Instead oxidation of methionine and proline were included as variable modifications. The MS tolerance and MS/MS tolerance were 10 ppm and 0.4 Da, respectively. Duo, triple, and quadric charges of precursor ions were selected and an ESI-QUAD-TOF system was set as the instrument used. All data sets were simultaneously searched against the decoy database to apply a false discovery rate (FDR) between 1.5 to 7% and a p-value < 0.01. Peptides with an ion score lower than 30 were rejected. Peptide spectra for protein hits identified by only one peptide were manually inspected, thereby reducing the FDR value.

Allicin induces apoptosis or necrosis in a dose-dependent manner but sublethal doses influence cellular metabolism and signalling cascades. Oxidation of protein thiols and depletion of the glutathione pool are thought to be responsible for allicin’s physiological effects. Here, we studied the effect of Allicin on post-translational thiol-modification in human Jurkat cells using shotgun LC-MS/MS analyses. We identified 332 proteins in the human Jurkat cell proteome that were modified by S-thioallylation which causes a mass shift of 72 Dalton on cysteines. Many S-thioallylated proteins are high abundant proteins, including the cytoskeletal proteins tubulin, actin, cofilin, filamin and plastin-2, the heat shock chaperones HSP90 and HSPA4, the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH, ALDOA, PKM as well the protein translation factor EEF2. We confirmed that Allicin disrupted the actin cytoskeleton in mouseL929 fibroblasts. Allicin further resulted in Zn2+ release from proteins and stimulated the Zn2+-dependent IL1-triggered release of IL2 in murine EL4 T-cells. Allicin further caused inhibition of enolase activity. In conclusion, our study revealed the overall extent of widespread S-thioallylation in the human Jurkat cell proteome after allicin exposure which affects essential  cellular functions of selected allicin targets.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""JURKAT cell""]","[{""ptm"":""L-methionine sulfoxide"",""UNIMOD"":""35#M""},{""ptm"":""N-ethylmaleimide derivatized cysteine"",""UNIMOD"":""108#C""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Allicin, S-thioallylation, protein modification, cysteine, cytoskeleton, actin, enolase, zinc, Jurkat, fibroblasts, T-cells, interleukin IL1, IL2","Post-translational thiol-modifications of proteins were identified by searching all MS/MS spectra in “dta” format against the human proteome target-decoy protein sequence database (52496 entries) extracted from UniprotKB release 12.7 (UniProt Consortium, Nucleic acids research 2007, 35, D193-197) using Sorcerer™-SEQUEST® (Sequest v. 2.7 rev. 11, Thermo Electron including Scaffold 4.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR).

Mutations in Caveolin-3 cause myopathies of variable severity. The pathogenicity of the Caveolin-3 variant G55S is still unclear. Here, we report on three patients suffering from mild to moderate myopathy. In all three patients, but also in two seemingly unaffected family members of patient one the G55S variant was found. Histology revealed moderate chronic myopathic changes and reduced sarcolemmal Caveolin-3 immunoreactivity in all three cases. Immunoblots for Caveolin-3 were abnormal in all cases. By electron microscopy, enlarged caveolae were detected in case one and three and vacuolar myopathy in case two. EM studies of RCMH myoblasts transfected with G55S Caveolin-3 revealed autophagic vacuoles. The alterations in Golgi morphology were in line with pathological Caveolin-3 deposits in this organelle detected by immunofluorescence and indicative for activation of autophagy. Phospho-blotting demonstrated that G55S affects EGFR signaling. Proteomic profiling of transfected RCMH myoblasts demonstrated alterations in levels of physiologically relevant proteins which are indicative for antagonization of G55S Caveolin-3 expression. Some proteomic alterations were enhanced by osmotic/mechanical stress. In conclusion, our results suggest that the G55S Caveolin-3 sequence variant can be compensated by cellular defense mechanisms and that additional stress may lead to vulnerability of G55S Caveolin-3 expressing muscle cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TIC""]","Caveolin-3, LGMD1D, RCMH, proteome profile of muscle cells","Label free quantification of the acquired MS data was performed using the Progenesis LC-MS software from Nonlinear Dynamics (Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K.).

The two main lung cancer types are small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-SCLC (NSCLC), where NSCLC comprises about 80-85% of all lung cancer. Despite the introduction of improved treatments, the overall survival rate of lung cancer patients remains low. Further elucidation of the regulatory network perturbations between cancer-related genes and proteins is one promising route to alter this mortality trend. The deregulation of the DNA replication, cell cycle, proliferation and migration are the common factors that are involved in cancer development and progression, and therefore logical targets for analysis.  Minichromosome maintenance 2(MCM2) is a DNA replication licensing factor, which belongs to the heterohexameric MCM2-7 complex. MCM2 has been proposed as an excellent proliferation marker in many types of cancer.

The cell line under study was 82 (6), and the variant identifications were counted in the union of the 6 biological replicates. The assumption was that the bigger databases corresponding to lower confidence thresholds (or no threshold for the case of raw database) contain more false matches that cannot be confirmed at the proteome level. However, it turned out that the number of identified variant peptides grows almost linearly with the increase in the database size. The effect of the database size on the number of false identification was studied by searching one LC-MS/MS replicate of the same cell line against its own databases and against the united databases of all other cell lines. The variant peptides of other databases present also in the database of cell line 6 (level 0 or raw) were excluded. The exclusion of variants present in database 6lev0 from the ""wrong database search"" results leads to a substantial number of variant identifications, while the exclusion of the variants present in ""raw"" database of cell line 6 resulted in few (0 to 3) false variant identifications even for large variant database sizes. This means that the list of variant sequences in level 0 database is not complete, and the use of unfiltered databases is preferable. Open search implying wide precursor mass window and small fragment mass tolerance is used to define the modification pattern in LC-MS/MS datasets. In this work such search was performed using X!Tandem with precursor mass accuracy of 500 Da in order to find the most frequent mass shifts mimicking single amino acid substitutions. The identified variant peptides containing such substitutions are likely to be false matches.

Recently, research has focused on early-passage dermal papilla cells (DPCs), which have hair inducing activity both in vivo and in vitro. Our previous study indicated that factors secreted from early-passage DPCs contribute to hair follicle (HF) regeneration. To identify which factors are responsible for HF regeneration and why late-passage DPCs lose this potential，we collected 48-h-culture medium (CM) from both of passage 3 and 9 DPCs and subcutaneously injected the DPC-CM into NU/NU mice. Passage 3 DPC-CM induced HF regeneration, based on the emergence of a white hair coat, but passage 9 DPC-CM not. In order to identify the key factors responsible for hair inductive capacity, CM from passage 3 and 9 DPCs was analyzed by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic technology. We identified 1360 proteins, of which 213 proteins were differentially expressed between CM from early-passage vs. late-passage DPCs, including SDF1, MMP3, biglycan and LTBP1.Further analysis indicated that the differentially-expressed proteins regulated the Wnt, TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways, which directly and indirectly participate in HF morphogenesis and regeneration. Subsequently, we selected 19 proteins for further verification by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) between the two types of CM. These results would be used to identify the key factors for inducing HF regeneration and reveal the molecular mechanisms of losing inductive ability of DPCs. Furthermore, it is possible to explore some drugs for alopecia in the clinic according to this secretome date analysis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""hair follicle dermal papilla cell""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""}]","[""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""iTRAQ""]","Human, dermal papilla cell, iTRAQ","Discoverer 1.2 (PD 1.2, Thermo), [5600 msconverter], and the MGF file was searched.

DJ-1, a protein involved in oxidative stress sensing, gained major attention when mutations in its gene were identified in PD patients. Although the study of the corresponding protein function is still in its infancy, a crucial oxidation sensor at a conserved cysteine was linked to the disease. Inspired by inhibition studies with a bacterial homolog of DJ-1 we here screen several amino-epoxycylcohexenones and identify a chemical probe that exhibits specificity for the human protein in various cell lines. The probe selectively labeled the oxidation sensor via nucleophilic attack of the conserved cysteine onto the epoxide ring. This covalent addition occurred only in the reduced state. Whole proteome studies in HeLa, A549 and SHSY5Y cell lines confirmed strong enrichment of solely reduced DJ-1 which was diminished by increasing oxidative stress. The probe thus facilitates the first selective in situ monitoring of DJ-1 in its reduced state and enables studying the function of this important biomarker in dependence of oxidative stress.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lung"",""HeLa cell"",""brain""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""6x(13)C labeled residue"",""UNIMOD"":""188""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap XL"",""Orbitrap Fusion"",""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free"",""SILAC""]","Human, LC-MS/MS","Raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.8 or higher) with the Andromeda search engine.

It has approached 4000-8000 protein identifications (IDs) from a human cell line, mouse brains or Xenopus embryos via coupling with liquid chromatography (LC) prefractionation. However, at least five hundred micrograms of complex proteome digests were required for the LC-CZE-MS/MS studies. This requirement of a large amount of initial peptide material impedes the application of CZE-MS/MS for deep bottom-up proteomics of mass-limited samples. In this work, we coupled micro-scale reversed-phase LC (µRPLC) based peptide prefractionation to dynamic pH junction based CZE-MS/MS for deep bottom-up proteomics of the MCF7 breast cancer cell proteome starting with only 5-µg peptides. The dynamic pH junction based CZE enabled a 500-nL sample injection from as low as a 1.5-µL peptide sample, using up to 33% of the available peptide material for an analysis. Two kinds of µRPLC prefractionation were investigated, C18 ZipTip and nanoflow RPLC. C18 ZipTip-CZE-MS/MS identified 4453 proteins from 5 µg of the MCF7 proteome digest and showed good qualitative and quantitative reproducibility. Nanoflow RPLC-CZE-MS/MS produced over 7500 protein IDs and nearly 60000 peptide IDs from the 5-µg MCF7 proteome digest. The nanoflow RPLC-CZE-MS/MS platform reduced the required amount of complex proteome digests for LC-CZE-MS/MS-based deep bottom-up proteomics by two orders of magnitude.

Antigen-specific immunotherapy holds promise to strengthen immune control in CML, but requires the identification of CML-associated targets. In this study, we used a mass spectrometry-based approach to identify naturally presented HLA class I- and class II-presented peptides in 20 primary CML samples. Comparative HLA ligandome profiling using a comprehensive dataset of different hematological benign specimen delineated a novel panel of frequently expressed CML-exclusive peptides. These non-mutated target antigens are of particular relevance since our extensive data-mining approach demonstrated absence of naturally presented BCR-ABL- and ABL-BCR-derived HLA-presented peptides and the lack of frequent tumor-exclusive presentation of predescribed cancer/testis and leukemia-associated antigens. Functional characterization revealed spontaneous T-cell responses against the newly identified CML-associated peptides in CML patients and their ability to de novo induce multifunctional and cytotoxic antigen-specific T cells in healthy volunteers and CML patients. This characterizes these antigens as prime candidates for T cell-based immunotherapy approaches that may prolong TKI-free survival and even mediate cure of CML patients.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""peripheral blood mononuclear cell""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap XL""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"chronic myeloid leukemia, mass spectrometry, immunopeptidome",MS data analysis was carried out using Proteome discoverer.

Understanding the mechanism of drug resistance is important for finding new therapeutic approaches. In the present study, we found that the expression of vimentin was down-regulated in drug-resistance ovarian cancer A2780-DR and SKOV-3/DDP cells compared to the drug sensitive A2780 and SKOV-3 cells. Overexpression of vimentin in A2780-DR cells markedly increased their sensitivity to cisplatin, whereas knockdown of vimentin in A2780 cells increased the resistance to cisplatin, demonstrating that vimentin plays an important role in cisplatin resistance. Quantitative proteomic analysis identified 95 differentially expressed proteins between A2780-VIM-KN and control cells, which involved in many cellular processes. Down-regulation of endocytic proteins and the up-regulation of exocytic proteins were proposed to contribute the decreased cisplatin accumulation in A2780-VIM-KN cells. Cancer stem cell markers were found to be up-regulated in A2780-VIM-KN cells which were more facile to form spheroids as compared to control cells. Our results also showed that down-regulation of vimentin increased the 14-3-3 mediated retention of Cdc25C in the cytoplasm, leading to inactivation of Cdk1 and the prolonged G2 arrest that allows the longer period of time for cells to repair cisplatin-damaged DNA. Taken together, the down-regulation of vimentin enhances cells’ resistance to cisplatin via mediating multiple cellular processes, suggesting that vimentin is a potential target for treatment of drug resistant ovarian cancer.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Top-down proteomics""]","[""TMT""]",Ovarian cancer cell line; Drug-resistance; Proteomics; Vimentin; Cisplatin,"The MS/MS spectra from each LC-MS/MS run were searched against the human.fasta database downloaded from Uniprot (release date of January 10, 2015; 89105 sequences) using an in-house Sequest HT Algorithm in Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.4).

Until now, research mainly focused on differences in core ribosomal proteins and associated factors. The impact of posttranslational modifications has not yet been studied systematically. Analyzing ribosome heterogeneity is challenging since individual proteins can be part of different subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S and polysomes). Here, we develop polysome proteome profiling (3P) to obtain unbiased proteomic maps across ribosomal subcomplexes. 3P combines extensive fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation with quantitative mass spectrometry. The high resolution of the profiles allows us to assign proteins to specific subcomplexes. Phosphoproteomics on 3P fractions reveals that phosphorylation of serine 38 in RPL12 -- a known mitotic CDK1 substrate -- is strongly depleted in polysomes. Follow-up experiments confirm that RPL12 phosphorylation regulates translation of specific subsets of mRNAs during mitosis.

PXD005864,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD005864,Proteomic analysis of neuroblastoma-derived exosomes LC-MS,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor. At diagnosis, around 70% of patients with metastatic disease present bone-marrow (BM) infiltration; however, the mechanism underlying this specific tropism has to be elucidated. Tumor-derived exosomes may support metastatic progression in several tumors by interacting with the microenvironment, and may serve as tumor biomarkers. The main objective of this study was to identify an exosomal signature associated with NB metastatic BM dissemination. Therefore, we characterized the proteomic cargo of exosomes isolated from NB cell lines derived from primary tumor (PT) and BM metastasis. The comparison among all exosomal proteins showed 15 proteins exclusively present in PT, mainly involved in neuronal development, and 6 proteins in BM metastasis-derived exosomes related to cancer progression. Significant proteins obtained with t-test analysis, performed between the 2 groups (PT and BM metastasis), revealed that PT exosomes contain a higher level of proteins involved in extra-cellular matrix (ECM) assembly and adhesion, as well as in neuronal development. Exosomes isolated from BM metastasis showed proteins involved in ameboidal cell migration and mitochondrial activity.

In the current study, we performed comparative quantitative proteomics on whole plasma sampled from patients with stable angina (NMI), acute myocardial infarction (MI), and healthy control subjects without angina (Ctrl). We detected a total of 371 proteins with high confidence (FDR < 1%, p < 0.05), including 53 candidate biomarkers that displayed ≥ 2-fold modulated expression in patients with cardiovascular diseases (27 associated with atherosclerotic stable angina, 26 with myocardial injury). In the verification phase, we used label-free LC-MRM-MS-based targeted proteomic method to quantify and to verify the candidate biomarkers in pooled plasma, excluded peptides that were poorly distinguished from background, and then performed further validation of the remaining candidates in 49 individual plasma samples. Using this approach, we identified a final panel of 8 proteins that were both reliably and significantly modulated in disease (p < 0.05), including novel biomarkers of atherosclerotic stable angina that have been implicated in endothelial dysfunction (F10 and MST1), and previously unknown biomarkers of myocardial injury reportedly involved in either plaque destabilization (SERPINA3, CPN2, LUM) or tissue protection/repair mechanisms (ORM2, ACTG1, NAGLU).

Until now, research mainly focused on differences in core ribosomal proteins and associated factors. The impact of posttranslational modifications has not yet been studied systematically. Analyzing ribosome heterogeneity is challenging since individual proteins can be part of different subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S and polysomes). Here, we develop polysome proteome profiling (3P) to obtain unbiased proteomic maps across ribosomal subcomplexes. 3P combines extensive fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation with quantitative mass spectrometry. The high resolution of the profiles allows us to assign proteins to specific subcomplexes. Phosphoproteomics on 3P fractions reveals that phosphorylation of serine 38 in RPL12 -- a known mitotic CDK1 substrate -- is strongly depleted in polysomes. Follow-up experiments confirm that RPL12 phosphorylation regulates translation of specific subsets of mRNAs during mitosis.

PXD007896,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007896,Comprehensive proteomics identification of IFN-λ3-regulated anti-viral proteins in HBV-transfected cells,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes both acute and chronic liver inflammation. Approximately 600,000 CHB patients each year die of HBV-related diseases such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Therefore, CHB remains a global health concern. Although there have been anti-HBV agents for treating CHB, they have some limitations including viral-drug resistance and adverse effects. Type III IFN or IFN-λ is promising to use as anti-HBV agents because of its anti-viral activities like type I IFNs. In addition, the expression of its receptor, IFNLR1, is limited only in epithelial cells including hepatocytes. Thus, treatment with IFN-lambda results in less side effects compared to IFN-alpha treatment. IFN-lambdas have been shown to inhibit the replication of several viruses including IAV, DENV, EMCV, HIV, HCV, and HBV; however, there have been no studies on the effects of IFN-λ3, the highest activity among other subtypes, on HBV replication. Therefore, this study aims to determine antiviral activities of IFN-λ3 against HBV replication and to investigate its molecular mechanism responsible for suppressing HBV propagation. The results showed that HBV transcripts and amount of intracellular HBV DNA were decreased in HepG2.2.15 cells, stable HBV-transfected hepatoblastoma cell line, treated with IFN-λ3 in a dose-dependent manner. This indicated that IFN-λ3 could inhibit HBV replication. Next, we performed quantitative proteomics to investigate the proteome changes in HepG2.2.15 treated with IFN-λ3. The proteins that changed their expressions were involved in several biological processes such as defense to viral infection, immune responses, cell-cell adhesion, transcription, translation, and metabolism. We further confirmed the proteomics results by immunoblotting assay. Consistent with MS data, it found that the expression of OAS3, SAMHD1 and STAT1 were increased as a result of IFN-λ3 stimulation. These results indicated that proteomics results were reproducible and reliable. Finally, we proposed 3 possible mechanisms involved in suppressing HBV replication including i.) IFN-λ3 induced anti-viral proteins affecting many steps in HBV life cycle ii.) IFN-λ3 promoted antigen processing and antigen presentation and iii.) IFN-λ3 rescued RIG-I signaling to promote both type I and type III IFN production.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 based isotope labeling""]","IFN-λ3, Hepatitis B Virus, LC-MS/MS, Dimethyl labeling","Using Proteome Discoverer™ Software 2.1 (Thermo), the MS raw data files were searched against a composite database containing the forward and reversed peptide sequences of the Human Swiss-Prot Database (20,219 proteins, June 2017) and the Hepatitis B Virus Swiss-Prot Database (225 proteins, June 2017).

PXD004941,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD004941,Integrative analysis of proteome and ubiquitylome reveals unique features of protein ubiquitylation and mitochondria in gefitinib resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells,"Even though gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, widely used in treating non-small cell lung cancer   (NSCLC) patients carrying EGFR activating mutations, most patients will develop gefitinib   resistance. Protein ubiquitylation is one of major posttranslational modifications affecting the   stability or function of the protein. However, the role of protein ubiquitylation in gefitinib resistance   is poorly understood. To systematically identify the global change in protein ubiquitylation during   gefitinib resistance, we carried out quantitative global proteome and ubiquitylome study by using   cells with stable isotopic labeling with amino acid in cell culture (SILAC) followed by affinity   enrichment of ubiquitylated peptides and subsequent liquid chromatography–tandem mass   spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Our study quantified  are differentially regulated in ubiquitylation between gefitinib resistant and sensitive cells. Among   them, 799 lysine sites were up-regulated in ubiquitylation in resistant cells, which are enriched in   pathways, such as SNARE interaction in vesicle transport, endocytosis, phagosome, and lysosome,   etc. In addition, we also found  cells. The proteins carry these sites are involved in pathways including metabolic pathways, gap   junction, and biosynthesis of amino acids, etc, This data indicate that gefitinib resistance   dramatically alters the landscape of ubiquitylation in the cells. Furthermore, by integrating the   genome-wide transcriptome data, we discovered that complexes I and IV in the electron transport   chain of the mitochondria are up-regulated, while complexes II and III are down-regulated in   resistant cells. Overall, these results reveal the unique features of ubiquitylation and mitochondria   during gefitinib resistance, which will help to a better understanding of the role(s) of ubiquitylation,   and to identify new therapeutic targets in overcoming gefitinib resistance.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""ubiquitination signature dipeptidyl lysine"",""UNIMOD"":""121#K""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","Human, non-small cell lung cancer cells, LC_MSMS, lung","Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Analysis   Peptides were dissolved in 0.1% FA, directly loaded onto a reversed-phase pre-column (Acclaim   PepMap 100, Thermo Scientific).

Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are frequent in TNBC and have been shown to correlate with outcome, suggesting an immunogenic component in this subtype. However, other factors, intrinsic to the cancer cells, may also influence outcome. To identify proteins and molecular pathways associated with recurrence in TNBC, 34 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary TNBC tumors were investigated by global proteomic profiling using TMT-HILIC-LC-MS/MS. Approximately half of the patients were lymph node-negative and remained free of local or distant metastasis within 10 years follow-up, while the other half developed distant metastasis. Proteomic profiling identified >4000 proteins, of which 63 exhibited altered expression in primary tumors of recurrence versus recurrence-free patients. Importantly, down-regulation of proteins in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation pathways were enriched, including TAP1, TAP2, CALR, HLA-A, ERAP1 and TAPBP, and were associated with significantly shorter recurrence-free and overall survival. In addition, proteins involved in cancer cell proliferation and growth, including GBP1, RAD23B, WARS and STAT1, also exhibited altered expression in primary tumors of recurrence versus recurrence-free patients.

Several mechanisms regulate eNOS activity and function, including phosphorylation at Ser and Thr residues and protein-protein interactions. Combining a tandem affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry, we identified stromal cell-derived factor 2 (SDF2) as a component of the eNOS macromolecular complex in endothelial cells. SDF2 knockdown impaired agonist stimulated NO synthesis and decreased phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177, a key event required for maximal activation of eNOS. Conversely, SDF2 overexpression dose-dependently increased NO synthesis through a mechanism involving Akt and calcium (induced with ionomycin), which increased the phosphorylation of Ser1177 in eNOS. NO synthesis by iNOS (inducible NOS) and nNOS (neuronal NOS) was also enhanced upon SDF2 overexpression. We found that SDF2 was a client protein of the chaperone protein Hsp90, interacting preferentially with the M domain of Hsp90, which is the same domain that binds to eNOS. In endothelial cells exposed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), SDF2 was required for the binding of Hsp90 and calmodulin to eNOS, resulting in eNOS phosphorylation and activation.

MS data provide definite protein identifications in each fraction, creating a reference for antibody reactivity patterns obtained via MAP. The method employs automated software to compare both datasets and provide validation data for each antibody tested. Due to the high-throughput nature of the assay we were able to screen several thousands of antibodies against six different cell lines. The differences in protein expression between the cell lines provide an additional control of antibody specificity. Using PAGE-MAP it is possible to screen and validate thousands of antibodies in a matter of weeks. Moreover, antibodies are tested under standardized conditions, which allows for direct comparison of their performance.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""JURKAT cell"",""cell culture"",""HeLa cell"",""cell suspension culture""]","[{""ptm"":""isotope labeled residue"",""UNIMOD"":""259""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","on-bead digestion, GelFree, LC-MS/MS, PAGE-MAP, antibody validation","MS raw files were submitted to MaxQuant software version 1.5.2.8 for protein identification.

PXD010372,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010372,Multi-level proteomics identifies CT45 as a  chemosensitivity mediator and immunotherapy target in ovarian cancer,"Most high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients develop resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and recur, but 15% remain disease-free over a decade. To discover drivers of long-term survival, we quantitatively analyzed the proteomes of platinum resistant and sensitive HGSOC patients from minute amounts of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. This revealed cancer/testis antigen 45 (CT45) as an independent prognostic factor associated with a doubling of disease-free survival in advanced stage HGSOC. Phospho- and interaction proteomics tied CT45 to DNA damage pathways through direct interaction with the PP4 phosphatase complex. In vitro, CT45 regulated PP4 activity and its high expression led to increased DNA damage and platinum sensitivity. CT45-derived HLA class I peptides, identified by immunopeptidomics, activate patient-derived cytotoxic T cells and promote tumor cell killing. This study highlights the power of clinical cancer proteomics to identify targets for chemo- and immunotherapy and illuminate their biological roles.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""epithelial ovarian cancer cell""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","Proteomics, Ovarian Cancer, Biomarker","MS raw files were processed with the MaxQuant software (Cox and Mann, 2008) (version 1.5.3.15).

However, proteomes of cultured cells undergo also natural alteration associated with changes in the media, attaining a degree of confluence as well as due to cell division, metabolic and circadian cycles. These changes are implicitly assumed to be smaller in magnitude than the drug-induced changes that ultimately lead to cell demise.  In this study, we tested this assumption experimentally by comparing the proteome dynamics of cancer cells during the first 48 h after treatment with methotrexate, paclitaxel or vehicle (equivalent to untreated control). Time series revealed considerable growth-related proteome changes in the control group, comparable in magnitude to drug-induced changes. The magnitude of these variations reveals an unexpected plasticity of the cellular proteome and reinforces the need, generally accepted in theory but not always followed in practice, to use a time-matched control when measuring drug-induced proteome changes.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion"",""Q Exactive Plus""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TIC""]",FITExP; mass spectrometry; proteomics; principal component analysis; time series,"Protein identification and quantification were performed using MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.30).

Since these mutations do not affect protein structure, the molecular mechanism of their pathogenicity is enigmatic. Here, we employ a peptide-based proteomic screen to investigate the impact of mutations in IDRs on protein-protein interactions. We find that mutations in disordered cytosolic regions of three transmembrane proteins (GLUT1, ITPR1 and CACNA1H) lead to an increased binding of clathrin. In all three cases, the mutation creates a dileucine motif known to mediate clathrin-dependent trafficking. Follow-up experiments on full length GLUT1 (SLC2A1), the glucose transporter causative of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, revealed that the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments in a model cell line and in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Mutant GLUT1 interacts with adaptor proteins (APs) in vitro, and knocking-down AP-2 reverts the cellular mislocalization. A systematic analysis of other known disease-causing variants revealed a significant and specific overrepresentation of gained dileucine motifs in structurally disordered cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins. Thus, several mutations in disordered regions appear to cause “dileucineopathies”.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","protein-protein interaction, peptide array, PPI, disordered regions","Raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant software version 1.5.2.8 (Cox and Mann, 2008).

A POR has been found to be related to several factors, including advanced age, high body mass index, and history of ovarian or pelvic surgery. However, it is difficult to predict POR, as there are no specific biomarkers known. In this study, we used quantitative proteomic analyses to investigate potential biomarkers that can predict poor response during IVF based on follicular fluid samples. A total of 1,079 proteins were identified using a high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled online to a nano flow liquid chromatography system. It is notable that 65 up-regulated and 66 down-regulated proteins were found to be functionally enriched in poor responders. We also validated these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) using a triple-quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometer for quantification of targeted proteins. Of the DEPs, three proteins (pregnancy zone protein, renin, and sushi repeat-containing protein SRPX) were regarded as statistically significant (p < 0.05). These proteins (one known as an inhibitor of cell growth and another as a regulator of angiogenesis) are potential biomarkers candidates of POR in IVF.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""follicular fluid""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","Follicular fluid, Poor ovarian response, Biomarker, Proteomics, Multiple reaction monitoring","The prepared samples were re-suspended in 0.1% FA and analyzed using a Q Exactive Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) along with the Easy-nLc 1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

In HeLa cells, GA inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis, as showed by results of MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis. Possible target-related proteins of GA were searched using comparative proteomic analysis (2-DE) and 9 proteins at early (3 h) stage together with 9 proteins at late (24 h) stage were found. Vimentin was the only target-related protein found at both early and late stage. Results of both 2-DE analysis and Western blotting assay suggested cleavage of vimentin induced by GA. MS/MS analysis of cleaved vimentin peptides indicated possible cleavage sites of vimentin at or near aa51 and aa425. Results of targeted proteomic analysis showed that GA induced change in phosphorylation state of the vimentin head domain (aa51-64). Caspase inhibitors could not abrogate GA-induced cleavage of vimentin. Over-expression of vimentin ameliorated cytotoxicity of GA in HeLa cells. The GA-activated signal transduction, from p38 MAPK, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), vimentin, dysfunction of cytoskeleton, to cell death, was predicted and then confirmed. Results of animal study showed that GA treatment inhibited tumor growth in HeLa tumor-bearing mice and cleavage of vimentin could be observed in tumor xenografts of GA-treated animals. Results of immunohistochemical staining also showed down-regulated vimentin level in tumor xenografts of GA-treated animals. Furthermore, compared with cytotoxicity of GA in HeLa cells, cytotoxicity of GA in MCF-7 cells with low level of vimentin was weaker while cytotoxicity of GA in MG-63 cells with high level of vimentin was stronger. These results indicated the important role of vimentin in the cytotoxicity of GA.

It has been recently demonstrated that the formation and accumulation of RNA fragments (RFs) is cell-/tissue-specific and depends on internal and external stimuli. Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying RF biogenesis and function remain unclear. To better understand them, we employed RNA pull-down and mass spectrometry methods to characterize the interaction networks of seven RFs originating from tRNA, snoRNA and snRNA. In addition, we performed an in silico screen of the selected RFs against publicly available cross-linking and immunoprecipitation datasets. We determined that the RF interactome comprises a large number of proteins, which were generally different from those that interact with their parental full length RNAs. Proteins that were differentially bound by the RFs were involved in mRNA splicing, tRNA processing, DNA recombination/replication, protein biosynthesis and carbocyclic acid metabolism. Our data suggest that RFs can be endogenous aptamer-like molecules and potential players in emerging RNA-protein regulatory networks.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","RNA fragments, protein interactome, RNA-protein interaction","Protein identification and quantification was performed using MaxQuant version 1.5.1.2 [32], which is available online at http://www.coxdocs.org.

In mammalian cells active or primed enhancers are commonly marked by monomethylation of Histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) in a cell-type specific manner. Whether and how this histone modification regulates enhancer-dependent transcription programs in mammals has been unclear. In the present study, we conducted SILAC Mass-spec experiments with mono-nucleosomes and identified multiple H3K4me1 associated proteins, including proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. We demonstrate that H3K4me1 augments the association of the chromatin remodeling complex BAF to enhancers in vivo.  Furthermore we show that in vitro, H3K4me1 nucleosomes are more efficiently remodeled by the BAF complex. Crystal structures of a BAF component BAF45c further reveal that monomethylation, but not trimethylation, is accommodated in this protein’s H3K4 binding site. Our results suggest that H3K4me1 plays an active role at enhancers by facilitating the binding of the BAF complex and possibly other chromatin regulators.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""6x(13)C labeled residue"",""UNIMOD"":""188""},{""ptm"":""carbamoylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""5""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","BAF, monomethylation of Histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and Enhancers",".

The objective of this research is to observe change of protein profile induced by Ranibizumab (an anti-VEGF agent) in vitreous humor from PDR patients and reveal the effects of anti-VEGF treatment on PDR. Methods: A proteomic method was used to identify differentially expressed proteins in vitreous humor. Untreated PDR patients were defined as PDR group, while those who treated with intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (IVR) were defined as IVR. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and REACTOME pathways were obtained from DAVID Bioinformatics Resources. Intravitreal level of apolipoprotein C-I (APOC1), serpin peptidase inhibitor clade A member 5 (SERPINA5), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP2), and keratin 1 (KRT1) were determined by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). Results: 339 differentially expressed proteins were identified in response to IVR. The most notable GO annotation describes the altered proteins was “innate immune response”. The most notable REACTOME pathway was “platelet degranulation”. ELISA result showed increased level of APOC1, SERPINA5, KRT1 and a decreased level of TIMP2 in PDR group compared with IVR. Conclusions: In addition to decreasing VEGF level, Ranibizumab is associated with change of human vitreous protein profile in patients with PDR, in which the differential proteins are involved in immune response, platelet degranulation, complement activation etc., suggesting that the effects of VEGF are involved in these signaling pathways.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""vitreous humor""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Thermo Scientific""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,proteomics; Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy; Ranibizumab,"Protein analysis was performed using the Integrated Proteomics Pipeline, IP2 (Integrated Proteomics Applications, Inc., San Diego, CA).

PXD009915,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009915,Evidence for the nuclear import of monomeric histones H3.1 & H4,"We present here evidence that histones H3.1 and H4 can be imported into the nucleus as monomers in human cells. Using a tether-and-release system to study the cytosolic phase and import dynamics of newly synthesised histones, we find that H3.1 and H4 can be maintained as stable monomers in the cytosol in a tethered state. Cytosolically tethered histones are bound tightly to Importin- proteins (predominantly IPO4), but not to the histone specific chaperones NASP, ASF1a, RbAp46 (RBBP7) or HAT1, which reside in the nucleus in interphase cells. Release of monomeric histones from their cytosolic tether results in rapid nuclear translocation, dissociation with IPO4 and incorporation into chromatin at sites of replication. Quantitative analysis of histones bound to individual chaperones under steady-state conditions reveals an excess of H3 specifically associated with sNASP, suggesting that NASP can maintain a soluble, monomeric pool of H3 within the nucleus and may act as a nuclear receptor for newly imported histone. In summary, we propose that histones H3 and H4 are rapidly imported as monomeric units, forming heterodimers in the nucleus rather than the cytosol, with sNASP acting as a potential nuclear receptor for monomeric histone H3.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion""]","[""Biological""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","Human, histones","The raw data were searched using MaxQuant software version 1.6.0.16 against UniProtKB Human database (UP000005640, 71,785 entries, release March 2017) and the common contaminant database from MaxQuant (Tyanova et al. 2016).

The two hotspot mutations in PIK3CA, E545K and H1047R, have been shown to regulate widespread signaling events downstream of AKT. However, the impact of these activating mutations on the tyrosine phosphorylation signaling in the cell has not been studied. Here, we performed a global phosphotyrosine profiling using isogenic knockin cell lines containing these activating mutations. We identified 824 unique phosphopeptides from 308 proteins. We found a surprisingly widespread modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation levels of proteins in the knockin mutant cells, with many of the regulated proteins involved in important biological processes, including those in the cytoskeletal migration pathways and kinase regulated signaling. We observed a widespread modulation of the tyrosine kinome, with 24 of the tyrosine kinases showing either upregulation or downregulation in phosphorylation levels. Many of the regulated phosphosites that we identified were located in the kinase domain or the canonical activating sites, indicating that the kinases were active and hence their downstream signaling pathways. Our study thus shows that the activating mutations in PIK3CA result in widespread tyrosine signaling regulation, in addition to the serine/threonine signaling pathways activated by the canonical PI3K-AKT axis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""isotope labeled residue"",""UNIMOD"":""259""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","Human, PIK3CA, breast cancer, phosphoproteomics, tyrosine","The Proteome Discoverer (v 1.4; Thermo Fisher Scientific) software package was used to facilitate downstream protein identification and quantitation.

PXD010069,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010069,Hsp70 ATP-dependent dimerization and Chaperone/Co-chaperone Interactions,"Eukaryotic protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is largely dependent on the action of highly conserved Hsp70 molecular chaperones. Recent evidence indicates that apart from conserved molecular allostery, Hsp70 proteins retained and adapted throughout the evolution the ability to assemble as functionally relevant ATP-bound dimers. Here we have compared the ATP-dependent dimerization of DnaK, human stress-inducible Hsp70, Hsc70 and BiP Hsp70 proteins showing that their dimerization propensities differ with stress-inducible Hsp70 being predominantly dimeric in the presence of ATP. The structural analyses using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, chemical cross-linking and small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that stress-inducible Hsp70 assembles in solution as an antiparallel dimer with the intermolecular interface closely resembling the ATP-bound dimer interfaces captured in DnaK and BiP crystal structures. ATP-dependent dimerization of stress-inducible Hsp70 is necessary for its efficient interaction with Hsp40 as shown by experiments with dimerization-deficient mutants. Moreover, dimerization of ATP-bound Hsp70 is required for its participation in high molecular weight protein complexes detected ex vivo supporting its functional role in vivo. As human cytosolic Hsp70 has the ability to interact with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain containing co-chaperones, we tested the interaction of Hsp70 ATP-dependent dimer with Chip and Tomm34 co-chaperones. While Chip associates with intact Hsp70 dimer to form a larger complex, binding of Tomm34 disrupts Hsp70 dimer and this event plays an important role in Hsp70 activity regulation. In summary, this study provides structural evidence of robust ATP-dependent antiparallel dimerization of human inducible Hsp70 protein and suggests novel role of TPR domain co-chaperones in multichaperone complexes involving Hsp70 ATP-bound dimers.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""solariX""]",,"[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Hsp70, co-chaperone, Chip, Tomm34, dimer","HDX-MS and LC-MSMS: Data processing (peak picking and export) was performed in DataAnalysis 4.1 and analysis of deuterated samples was done using in-house written program Deutex (unpublished).

Design: We used primary human OA chondrocytes and adipose stem cells (ASCs) in mono- and cocultures and performed a high throughput secretome analysis. Among secreted proteins differentially induced in cocultures, we identified thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) as a potential candidate that could be involved in the chondroprotective effect of ASCs. Results: Secretome analysis revealed significant induction of THBS1in ASCs/chondrocytes cocultures at the mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, we showed that THBS1 was up-regulated at late stages of MSC chondrogenic differentiation while recombinant THBS1 exerted a prochondrogenic effect on MSC. However, down-regulation of THBS1 in ASCs did not revert OA chondrocyte phenotype by decreasing hypertrophic and inflammatory markers.  Nevertheless, down-regulation of THBS1 in ASCs reduced their immunosuppressive activity while recombinant THBS1 exerted an anti-inflammatory role on T lymphocytes. THBS1 function was evaluated in vivo in the collagenase-induced OA (CIOA) model by comparing ASCs expressing siTHBS1 and control ASCs. The OA protective effect of ASCs was reversed when THBS1 was down-regulated in ASCs indicating that THBS1 plays a role in the therapeutic effect of ASCs Conclusions: Our data gather some evidence that THBS1 exerts a pro-chondrogenic and anti-inflammatory function in vitro, which could partially explain a chondroprotective effect of ASCs in OA.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""articular cartilage"",""cell culture"",""abdominal adipose tissue""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]",,"human, chondrocyte, adipose, mesenchymal stem cell","MS/MS data were searched in a Human database from UniprotKB (2012).

In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify phosphorylated residues within MLH1 and PMS2. The most frequently detected phosphorylated amino acid was serine 477 of MLH1. Isolation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions showed that p-MLH1S477 remains predominantly in the cytoplasm. Pharmacological treatment indicates‎ that Casein Kinase II (CK2) could be responsible for the phosphorylation of MLH1 at serine 477 in vivo. In vitro kinase assay verified MLH1 as a substrate of CK2. Most importantly, using in vitro MMR assay we could demonstrate that p-MLH1S477 lost MMR activity while the activity of MLH1S477A, which could not be phosphorylated at position S477, was not modified. In summary, we identified that post-translational phosphorylation of MLH1 by CK2 at amino acid position 477 can switch off MMR activity in vitro. Since CK2 is overexpressed in many tumors and is able to inactivate MMR by phosphorylation of MLH1, the new mechanism here described could have an important impact on tumors overactive in CK2.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]",,"DNA mismatch repair, MLH1, MutLα, phosphorylation, CK2, Lynch syndrome","Data analysis was carried out as described by Oellerich et al.

By mass spectrometry-based proteomics, 167 proteins corresponding to the GO terms “extracellular” and “cell adhesion”, or included in the “human matrisome” were identified in the deposited extracellular matrix, and 217 in the conditioned media of normal human keratinocytes. In the absence of integrin alpha3, 33% and 26% respectively were dysregulated. Dysregulated proteins were functionally related to integrin alpha3 or were known interaction partners.

In a previous study of KEAP1 mutations observed in lung cancer, we classified 40% of the mutations as ‘superbinders’ (superbinders). These mutants bind and ubiquitylate NRF2 but do not promote NRF2 degradation. Here, we further investigated the molecular mechanism(s) driving the superbinder phenotype. BioID-based quantitative proteomic analysis of the R320Q and R470C superbinder mutations revealed increased co-complexed NRF2 without significant alteration to other KEAP1-associated proteins, including CUL3, VCP, and several ubiquitin receptors within the proteasome lid. Dynamic simulation modeling and limited proteolysis analyses suggest that superbinder mutations stabilize residues in KEAP1 that contact NRF2. In cells, KEAP1 R320Q and R470C mutants co-localize with NRF2, p62/SQSTM1 and polyubiquitin in spherical clusters that rapidly fuse and dissolve; KEAP1-NRF2 localization to these clusters requires p62. Expression of R320Q and R470C in lung cancer cells provided resistance to the reactive oxygen species-inducing drug bleomycin. We present a model wherein superbinder mutations alter the conformational dynamics of the KEAP1-NRF2 complex to alter the cycling of KEAP1 between open and closed conformations, thus inhibiting NRF2 degradation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""biotinylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""6""},{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","KEAP1, NRF2, mutations, lung cancer, superbinders, p62, clusters","All raw mass spectrometry data were searched using MaxQuant version 1.5.2.6.

To address this gap, we have developed MITNCAT, multiplex isotope tagging / non-canonical amino acid tagging, a novel method enabling the robust quantification of proteome-wide protein synthesis rates with high temporal resolution (15-30 minutes) across multiple time points or treatment conditions, in a single analysis.  MITNCAT combines multiplexed isobaric mass tagging with bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to label newly synthesized proteins with azidohomoalanine (Aha) and pulsed SILAC (pSILAC), thus providing enrichment and multiplexed quantification of newly synthesized proteins.  We demonstrate the application of MITNCAT to quantify altered protein synthesis rates following induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation.  Eliciting the UPR by blocking N-glycosylation results in a global down-regulation of protein synthesis, with stronger down-regulation of proteins involved in the glycolysis pathway and protein synthesis machinery (ribosomal proteins, initiation factors, and elongation factors), but up-regulation of several key protein-folding chaperones.  MITNCAT enables the quantification of waves of temporally distinct protein synthesis in response to EGF stimulation, with altered protein synthesis on dozens of proteins detectable in the first 15 minutes. Comparison of protein synthesis with RNA sequencing and ribosome footprinting allowed the distinction between protein synthesis driven by an increase in transcription versus that driven by an increase in translational efficiency.  Temporal delays between ribosome occupancy and protein synthesis were observed and found to correlate with altered codon usage in significantly delayed proteins.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","Translation, Translatome, Synthesis","MS data files were searched on MASCOT version 2.4 with fixed modifications for NEM alkylation on cysteines (+125.047 Da), addition of TMT 6-plex to N-termini and lysine residues (+229.163 Da).

Multiple databases have been dedicated to PTMs, including recent initiatives oriented to the in silico prediction of PTM interactions. The study of PTM cross-talk ultimately requires experimental evidence about whether certain PTMs co-exist in a single protein molecule. However, available resources do not assist researchers in the experimental detection of co-modified peptides. Here we present TCellXTalk, a comprehensive database of phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation sites in human T cells that supports the experimental detection of co-modified peptides using targeted or directed mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of TCellXTalk and the strategy presented here in a proof of concept experiment that enabled the identification and quantification of 15 co-modified (phosphorylated and ubiquitinated) peptides in CD3 proteins of the T-cell receptor complex. To our knowledge, these are the first co-modified peptide sequences described in this widely studied cell type. Furthermore, quantitative data showed distinct dynamics of co-modified peptides upon T cell activation, demonstrating differential regulation of co-occurring PTMs in this biological context. Overall, TCellXTalk enables the experimental detection of co-modified peptides in human T cells and puts forward a novel and generic strategy for the study of PTM cross-talk.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""primary cell""]","[{""ptm"":""ubiquitination signature dipeptidyl lysine"",""UNIMOD"":""121#K""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP)"",""Human Proteome Project"",""Biological""]","[""SRM/MRM"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","cross-talk, T cells, PTMs, TCR activation","The raw data of the acetylome dataset were processed using Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4.0.288, Thermo Scientific).

We show that the mammalian spliceosome specifically associates with the S5P CTD isoform of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) as it elongates across spliced exons of protein coding genes, both in human Hela and murine lymphoid cell lines. Immuno-precipitation of MNase digested chromatin with phospho CTD specific antibodies reveals that components of the active spliceosome (both snRNA and proteins) form a specific complex with S5P CTD Pol II. Furthermore a dominant splicing intermediate formed by cleavage at intron 5’ss results in the tethering of upstream exons to this complex at all spliced exons. These are invariably connected to upstream spliced constitutive and less frequently to alternative exons. Finally S5P CTD Pol II accumulates over spliced exons but not adjacent introns. We propose that mammalian splicing employs a rapid, co-transcriptional splicing mechanism based on CTD phosphorylation transitions.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""LTQ XL""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""Mass spectrometry""]","net-seq, transcription, splicing, spliceosome, CTD","Peptide counts were first converted to normalized spectral index - SIN (Griffin et al., 2010).

PXD002091,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD002091,Positional proteomics reveals differences in N-terminal proteoform stability.,"To understand the impact of alternative translation initiation on a proteome, we performed the first large-scale study of protein turnover rates in which we distinguish between N-terminal proteoforms pointing to translation initiation events. Using pulsed SILAC combined with N-terminal COFRADIC we monitored the stability of 1,941human N-terminal proteoforms, including 147 proteoform pairs with heterogeneous N-termini originating from the same gene that result from alternative translation initiation and incomplete processing of the initiator methionine. N-terminally truncated proteoforms were on average less abundant than canonical proteoforms, many had different stabilities and exhibited both faster and slower turnover rates compared to their canonical counterparts. These differences in stability did not depend on the length of truncation but on individual protein characteristics. In silico simulation of N-terminal proteoforms in macromolecular complexes revealed possible consequences for complex integrity such as replacement of unstable canonical subunits. The extent of intrinsic disorder in N-terminal protein structures correlated with turnover times, indicating that a change in the structural flexibility of protein N-termini in truncated proteoforms might impact proteoform stability. Interestingly, removal of the initiator methionine by methionine aminopeptidases reduced the stability of processed proteoforms while susceptibility for N-terminal acetylation, another common co-translational modification, did not seem to impact on turnover rates. Taken together, our findings reveal differences in protein stability between N-terminal proteoforms and point to a role for alternative translation initiation and co-translational initiator methionine removal in the overall regulation of proteome homeostasis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""JURKAT cell""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""deaminated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""385""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""6x(13)C labeled residue"",""UNIMOD"":""188""},{""ptm"":""6x(13)C,4x(15)N labeled L-arginine"",""UNIMOD"":""267""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Technical"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","human, N-terminal COFRADIC, alternative translation initiation, protein stability, N-terminal proteoform, Nt-acetylation, initiator methionine processing, protein turnover","LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano HPLC (Dionex, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) in-line connected to an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

PXD000171,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000171,The effect of proteasome inhibition on the HLA peptidome,"The Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptidome is thought to be generated mostly through proteasomal degradation of cellular proteins, a notion that is based on the alterations in presentation of selected peptides following proteasome inhibition. We evaluated the effects of proteasome inhibitors, epoxomicin and bortezomib, on human cultured cancer cells. Since the inhibitors did not reduce the level of presentation of the cell surface human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, we followed their effects on the rates of synthesis of both HLA peptidome and proteome of the cells, using dynamic stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (dynamic-SILAC). The inhibitors reduced the rates of synthesis of most cellular proteins and HLA peptides, yet the synthesis rates of some of the proteins and HLA peptides was not decreased by the inhibitors and of some even increased. Therefore, we concluded that the inhibitors affected the production of the HLA peptidome in a complex manner, including modulation of the synthesis rates of the source proteins of the HLA peptides in addition to their effect on their degradation. The collected data may suggest that the current reliance on proteasome inhibition may overestimate the centrality of the proteasome in the generation of the MHC peptidome. It is therefore suggested that the relative contribution of the proteasomal and non-proteasomal pathways to the production of the MHC peptidome should be revaluated in accordance with the inhibitors effects on the synthesis rates of the source proteins of the MHC peptides. Bioinformatics & data processing: Peptides were identified and the dynamic-SILAC data were quantified using the MaxQuant and the Proteome Discoverer software tools. Graphical representation of the bioinformatics results was performed with Perseus, version 1.3.0.4.

Methionine oxidation was accepted as variable modification for both tryptic and HLA peptides. Carbamidomethyl cysteine and n-acetylation were accepted as modification for the proteomics analyses. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids and a maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed for tryptic peptides. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set for tryptic peptides to 0.01 for protein identifications, and 0.05 for the MHC peptides.

One intriguing illustration that still holds blind spots is the pediatric brain tumor arising from the developing cerebellum: medulloblastoma (MB). Extensive high-throughput sequencing led to the characterization of four MB subgroups (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4) delineated with distinct molecular signatures and clinical outcomes. However, up-to-date these analyses have not attained the global comprehension of their dynamic network complexity. Wishing to uncover a comprehensive view of all MB subgroups we employed a proteomic analysis to integrate accurate protein expression and activity that should ultimately give rise to a realistic picture of how MB cancer cells are regulated. In this study we present the first analysis regrouping methylation status, whole-transcriptome sequencing and quantitative proteomics (proteome and phosphoproteome) using a super SILAC / spiked in strategy across 38 flash frozen primary human MBs (5 WNT, 10 SHH, 10 Group 3 and 13 Group 4). First, our data pinpointed that proteomic analysis could reveal MB subgroup identity. Second, analysis of proteome and phosphoproteome highlighted disregulated signaling pathways that have not been predicted by transcriptomic analysis. Altogether, combined multi-scale analyses of MB have allowed us to identify unrevealed pathways involved in human MB genesis and progression.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""brain""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","Medulloblastoma, Multiomics, Proteomic, Phosphoproteomic, RNAseq, Methylome, Whole genome sequencing","Data were acquired using the Xcalibur software (v 3.0) and the resulting spectra were interrogated by Sequest HT through Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer (v 1.4) with the SwissProt Homo Sapiens database (032015).

Despite their teratogenicity, thalidomide and related IMiD drugs are now a mainstay of cancer treatment, however, the molecular basis underlying the pleiotropic biology and characteristic birth defects remains unknown. Here we show that IMiDs disrupt a broad transcriptional network through induced degradation of several C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, including SALL4, a member of the Spalt-like family of developmental transcription factors. Strikingly, heterozygous loss of function mutations in SALL4 result in a human developmental condition that phenocopies thalidomide induced birth defects such as absence of thumbs, phocomelia, defects in ear and eye development, and congenital heart disease. We find that thalidomide induces degradation of SALL4 exclusively in humans, primates and rabbits, but not in rodents or fish, providing a mechanistic link for the species-specific pathogenesis of thalidomide syndrome.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","IMiDs, thalidomide, ubiquitin, cullin, crl4","Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher) was used for .RAW file processing and controlling peptide and protein level false discovery rates, assembling proteins from peptides, and protein quantification from peptides.

PXD010705,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010705,Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid via data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the brain and serves as a valuable specimen to examine diseases of the central nervous system through analyzing its components. These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cerebrospinal fluid""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics"",""SWATH MS""]",,"proteomics, data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry, DIA, cerebrospinal fluid, CSF, spectral library","The .RAW files were converted into .HTRMS files by using the Raw to HTRMS Converter Professional provided by Biognosys.

Increasing evidence indicate that individual GalNAc-Ts co-regulate and fine-tune specific protein functions in health and disease, and deficiencies in individual GALNT genes underlie congenital diseases with distinct phenotypes. Studies of GalNAc-T specificities have mainly been performed with in vitro enzyme assays using short peptide substrate, but recently quantitative differential O-glycoproteomics of isogenic cells with and without GALNT genes has enabled a more unbiased exploration of the non-redundant contributions of individual GalNAc-Ts. Both approaches suggest that fairly small subsets of O-glycosites are non-redundantly regulated by specific GalNAc-Ts, but how these isoenzymes orchestrate regulation amongst competing redundant substrates is unclear. To explore this, we developed isogenic cell model systems with Tet-On inducible expression of two GalNAc-T genes, GALNT2 and GALNT11, in a knockout background. Using quantitative O-glycoproteomics with TMT labelling we found that isoform-specific glycosites were glycosylated in a dose dependent manner, and induction of GalNAc-T2 or T11 produced discrete glycosylation effects without affecting the major part of the glycoproteome.

Although RNA-seq data correlated with Mediator kinase targets, CA effects on gene expression were limited and distinct from CDK8 or CDK19 knockdown. Quantitative proteome analyses, which tracked about 7,000 proteins across six time points (0-24h), revealed that CA selectively affected pathways implicated in inflammation, growth, and metabolic regulation; contrary to expectations, increased turnover of Mediator kinase targets was not generally observed. Collectively, these data support Mediator kinases as regulators of chromatin and RNA polymerase II activity and suggest roles beyond transcription, including metabolism and DNA repair.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap"",""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","HCT116, colorectal carcinoma, SILAC, quantitative, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, CDK8, CDK19, Mediator, cortistatin A, Orbitrap LTQ, Orbitrap Velos","All raw MS files for phosphoproteomics and quantitative proteomics were searched using the MaxQuant (v1.4.1.2) software package.

The autophagic process is initiated by the formation of autophagosomes, which can selectively enclose cargo via autophagy cargo receptors. A machinery of well-characterized autophagy-related proteins orchestrate the biogenesis of autophagosomes, however, the origin of the required membranes is incompletely understood.  Here, we applied sensitized pooled CRISPR screens and identified the uncharacterized transmembrane protein TMEM41B as a novel regulator of autophagy. In the absence of TMEM41B, autophagosome biogenesis is stalled, LC3 accumulates at WIPI2- and DFCP1-positive isolation membranes, and lysosomal flux of autophagy cargo receptors and intracellular bacteria is impaired. In addition to defective autophagy, we found that TMEM41B knockout cells display significantly enlarged lipid droplets and reduced mobilization and β-oxidation of fatty acids. TMEM41B localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interacts with SIGMAR1, a chaperone which regulates calcium and lipid transfer at ER contact sites with mitochondria and lipid droplets. Taken together, we propose that TMEM41B is a novel regulator of autophagosome biogenesis and ER lipid mobilization.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]","[""TMT""]",autophagy/ contact sites/ CRISPR/ lipid droplets/ TMEM41B,"Protein identification and quantification were performed using Proteome Discoverer 2.1.0.81 with the SEQUEST algorithm and Uniprot human database.

Tumour cells in these starved regions sense reduced levels of oxygen and switch on genes that help them to adapt, survive and continue growing. Since hypoxia is a key physiological difference between normal and cancer tissue, an opportunity exists to selectively kill tumour cells by exploiting the differences in protein expression between normal and hypoxic tumour tissue. However, a major challenge is to identify druggable hypoxia-induced proteins critical for tumour cell survival. This is especially important in cancers of unmet need where hypoxia gene signatures correlate with poor prognosis (for example, colorectal cancers). To identify new hypoxia-induced proteins, we performed SILAC-based proteomics on colorectal cancer cells exposed to normoxia and hypoxia. In this study, we identify a new hypoxia-activated GPCR signalling axis that enables colorectal tumour cells to survive the microenvironmental stress of hypoxia. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role for this GPCR-axis as a key regulator of the adaptive response to hypoxia and highlght an opportunity to exploit tumour-associated hypoxia for therapy.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""colon""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","Colorectal cancer, hypoxia, SILAC","Raw data files were processed and quantified using Proteome Discoverer software v1.4 (Thermo) and searched against the UniProt Human database (122604 entries) using the SEQUEST algorithm.

Previous analyses of proteins extracted from ancient dental calculus revealed the presence of the dietary milk protein β-lactoglobulin, providing direct evidence of dairy consumption in the archaeological record. However, the potential for calculus to preserve other food-related proteins has not yet been systematically explored. Here we analyse shotgun metaproteomic data from 100 archaeological dental calculus samples ranging from the Iron Age to the post-medieval period (8thC BC - 19thC AD) in Britain, as well as dental calculus from contemporary dental patients and recently deceased individuals, to characterise the range and extent of dietary proteins preserved in dental calculus. In addition to milk proteins, we detected proteomic evidence of foodstuffs such as cereals and plant products, as well as the digestive enzyme salivary amylase. We discuss the importance of optimized protein extraction methods, data analysis approaches, and authentication strategies in the identification of dietary proteins from archaeological dental calculus. Our ability to detect dietary proteins, although limited, demonstrates the potential of these methods to robustly identify foodstuffs in the archaeological record that are under-represented due to their poor preservation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""dental plaque""]","[{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, Dental Calculus, Dental Plaque, LC-MS/MS","Raw spectral data was converted to Mascot generic format (mgf) using Proteowizard MSConvert (version 3.0.4743) using the 200 most intense peaks in each MS/MS spectrum.

MS data was assessed on the basis of ion intensity of peptide ions with coincident LC retention time and m/z values. These data were displayed as an intensity map by Progenesis LC-MS software (Nonlinear Dynamics). The software aligns data based on the LC retention time of each analysis to create a single aggregate run containing all of the MS data with those representing peptide ions indicated. Feature outline maps were then generated and these outlines were used to facilitate detection and quantification of peptide ions from individual analyses. The peptide quantitation algorithm in the software reports peptide abundance as the sum of the peak areas (pixel intensities) within its isotope boundaries. Each abundance value is then transformed to a ‘normalised’ abundance by applying a global scaling factor calculated from distribution factors of all peptide ratios in the analysis. This corrects for experimental/technical variation and ensures that up-regulation and down-regulation has the same weight. The distribution is calculated using log(ratio) values and as log(1) = 0.0 and can be modelled as follows: y'i = αkyi . Protein abundances for individual sample are then calculated as the sum of all component peptide abundances.  The identity of peptides was determined by exporting the MS/MS output files from the matched analysis into the Turbo SEQUEST search engine (BioWorks Browser 3.3; Thermo Electron Corporation) and interrogating it against the NCBI human RefSeq database release 51. The search parameters were as follows: peptide tolerance was set to 2 atomic mass unit, MS/MS tolerance was set at 1 atomic mass unit, charge states allowed is from +1 to +3 and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Modifications were set to allow for the detection S-carbamidomethylated cysteine (+57 Da). Each MS2 spectra was matched to only a single peptide with the highest scoring SEQUEST peptide hit. Cross-correlating (XCorr) MS data, with values >1.5, >2.0 and >2.5 for singly, doubly and triply charged ions respectively, were used to select peptides of high quality and reduced the possibility of including redundant peptides in subsequent data analysis.  All keratins were removed from the protein identification list. The current status of each protein, its name and molecular weight was updated by batch processing it on the NCBI protein database website. Where protein names contained the word ‘predicted’ or ‘like protein’, the accuracy of the assigned names were examined and corrected, where necessary. The issue of redundancy in identified proteins was addressed by including all possible assignments in the results table to make the data as transparent as possible. In those cases where an identified protein shares its sequence with other entries in the database then all entries are listed. The uniqueness (or otherwise) of the assignment of peptides to the sequence of one or more proteins was used to determine whether assignment could be made to a specific protein or to a group of related proteins (isoforms). Quantification was based on at least 2 peptides that were all uniquely assigned to one protein or to a group of related forms.   Protein abundance values were calculated on the basis of the ion intensities of the component peptides.  For detection of differentially expressed proteins, only proteins identified on the basis of at least two unique peptides were considered.

PXD009819,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009819,TRPS1 shapes YAP/TEAD-dependent transcription in breast cancer cells,"Yes-associated protein (YAP), the downstream transducer of the Hippo pathway is a key regulator of organ size, differentiation and tumourigenesis. Yet, the activity of YAP can also be modulated by Hippo-independent functions. To disclose these Hippo-independent regulators, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screening approach that identified the transcriptional repressor protein Trichorhinophalangeal Syndrome 1 (TRPS1) as a potent repressor of YAP-dependent transactivation. Using RNA-Sequencing and ChIP-Sequencing approaches we show that TRPS1 globally regulates YAP-dependent transcription by binding to a large set of joint genomic sites, mainly enhancers. Mechanistically, TRPS1 represses YAP-dependent enhancers function by recruiting a spectrum of corepressor complexes to joint sites. Consequently, loss of TRPS1 leads to activation of enhancers due to increased H3K27 acetylation and an altered promoter-enhancer interaction landscape. TRPS1 is commonly amplified in breast cancer which is associated decreased YAP activity and leads to a decreased frequency of intratumoural immune cells. Consistently, depletion of TRPS1 in the syngeneic 4T1 tumour model leads to a strongly decreased tumour growth in vivo. Our study uncovers TRPS1 as a new epigenetic regulator of YAP activity and it connects repression of YAP-dependent enhancer function to breast cancer.

Since these mutations do not affect protein structure, the molecular mechanism of their pathogenicity is enigmatic. Here, we employ a peptide-based proteomic screen to investigate the impact of mutations in IDRs on protein-protein interactions. We find that mutations in disordered cytosolic regions of three transmembrane proteins (GLUT1, ITPR1 and CACNA1H) lead to an increased binding of clathrin. In all three cases, the mutation creates a dileucine motif known to mediate clathrin-dependent trafficking. Follow-up experiments on full length GLUT1 (SLC2A1), the glucose transporter causative of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, revealed that the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments in a model cell line and in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Mutant GLUT1 interacts with adaptor proteins (APs) in vitro, and knocking-down AP-2 reverts the cellular mislocalization. A systematic analysis of other known disease-causing variants revealed a significant and specific overrepresentation of gained dileucine motifs in structurally disordered cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins. Thus, several mutations in disordered regions appear to cause “dileucineopathies”.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","BioID, proximity labeling","The resulting raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant software version 1.5.2.8 (Cox and Mann, 2008).

By monitoring the rate of incorporation of labelled amino acids into newly synthesised proteins as they appear in the media, we can differentiate those proteins that have been destined for secretion, and exhibit rapid labelling, from those with low rates of labelling or low turnover relative to the growth rate of the cells which is a feature of intracellular proteins. Part of the wet lab protocol for our analysis of secretomes, is the use of the resin, Strataclean (Agilent). In this Supplementary dataset to our main paper (also in PRIDE/ProteomeXchange), we characterise the linearity of capture of secreted proteins using Stracalean resin, by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry.

Methods A multi-platform high resolution shotgun proteomics approach was used to investigate the presence of T. pallidum proteins in male urine samples collected from individuals with and without syphilis. Study participants were included in an observational cohort study conducted at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium from 2014 to 2017. In total, N = 60 individuals were included in this sub-study, including n = 36 with early symptomatic stage (primary/secondary), n = 13 early latent and n = 5 late latent stage and n = 6 controls. Almost all participants were HIV-positive (56/60; 93 %) and identified as men who have sex with men (MSM) (59/60; 98 %). Sixteen (27 %) individuals were serum PCR positive for T. pallidum at the time of diagnosis. Ten pools containing urine from six participants (±1.5 mL per individual) were created based on clinical staging. Urine protein was extracted from the pools by a two-step molecular weight cut-off centrifugal filtration to remove large proteins and non-protein material. Samples were digested, subjected to multi-dimensional liquid chromatographic separation based on hydrophobicity and were analysed with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and/or liquid chromatography- electrospray ionization quadruple ion mobility time-of-flight high-definition mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-Q-IM-TOF) in data dependent (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and data independent HDMSE (ESI-IM-Q-TOF) acquisition modes. Results In total, 26 peptides corresponding to four unique T. pallidum proteins were uncovered in four different pooled urine samples, from n = 3 symptomatic (primary/secondary stage; PSS) and n = 1 latent stage pool. Peptides from GTPase Obg (Tp0742) were detected in two separate PSS pooled samples. Protein designations are listed as in the currently annotated T. pallidum proteome available at the UniProt database (Proteome ID: UP000014259) which is related to the genome assembly and annotation ID GCA_000410535.2 listed on the European Nucleotide Archive. Eleven peptides from an uncharacterized protein (Tp0369) and 8 peptides from a protein annotated as the Borrelia-like p83/100 protein (Tp0486) were detected in two different PSS pooled samples. A protein annotated as an ABC superfamily transport protein (Tp0804) was uncovered in a latent stage pooled sample. BLAST analyses revealed low peptide sequence similarity with other pathogenic and commensal prokaryotes and human proteins. Conclusions High resolution mass spectrometric analyses of protein extracts from pooled urine samples resulted in the detection of four T. pallidum proteins. This is the first successful account of applying proteomics approaches to detect treponemal antigens in clinical samples. These proteins could represent potential biomarkers for downstream diagnostic applications.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""urine""]","[{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""methylthiolated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""39""}]","[""Synapt MS""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""HDMSE""]",,Mass spectrometry; syphilis; Treponema pallidum; biomarker discovery; antigen test; urine; data independent acquisition; proteomics,"Data was processed using Symphony (Waters).

By combining proteomic profiles of breast tumors with a large-scale protein-protein interaction network, we have identified a set of 285 high-confidence protein complexes whose subunits have highly correlated protein abundance across tumor samples. We used this set to identify complexes that are reproducibly under- or over-expressed in specific breast cancer subtypes. We found that mutation or deletion of one subunit of a co-regulated complex was often associated with a collateral reduction in protein expression of additional complex members. This collateral loss phenomenon was typically evident from proteomic, but not transcriptomic, profiles suggesting post- transcriptional control. Mutation of the tumor suppressor E-cadherin (CDH1) was associated with a collateral loss of members of the adherens junction complex, an effect we validated using an engineered model of E-cadherin loss.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"protein complex, breast cancer, protein-protein interaction, collateral loss","The resulting mass spectra were analyzed using MaxQuant software (version 1.5.0.25) containing the in-built Andromeda search engine to identify the proteins from a human database (Uniprot HUMAN, release 2012_01) containing 20,242 entries.

PXD000030,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000030,Annexin A1 interacting proteins in chronic myeloid leukemia KCL22 cells,"In the present study, we used a functional proteomic approach to identify Annexin A1 (Anxa1) interacting proteins in the Philadelphia-positive KCL22 cell line. We focused on Anxa1 because it is one of the major proteins upregulated in imatinib-sensitive KCL22S cells versus imatinib-resistant KCL22R. Our proteomic strategy revealed 21 interactors. Bioinformatic analysis showed that most of these proteins are involved in cell death processes. Among the proteins identified, we studied the interaction of Anxa1 with two phosphatases, Shp1 and Shp2, which were recently identified as biomarkers of imatinib sensitivity in patients affected by chronic myeloid leukemia. Our data open new perspectives in the search for annexin-mediated signaling pathways and may shed light on mechanisms of resistance to imatinib that are unrelated to Bcr-Abl activity. For data analysis, we used the MASCOT software (version 2.4) Peptide Mass Fingerprinting search program (http://www.matrixscience.com) selecting NCBInr aug2010 database (11592891 sequences) (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov), and the following six parameters: specificity of the proteolytic enzyme used for hydrolysis (trypsin); up to 1 missed cleavage; cysteines such as S-carbamidomethylcysteines; unmodified N- and C-terminal ends; unmodified and oxidized methionines; putative Gln-induced pyroGlu formation; a precursor peptide maximum mass tolerance of 400 ppm, and a maximum fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da.

In particular, phosphoproteomics of MM has become of significant importance because of the central role that phosphorylation plays in the development of MM. Investigating clinical samples, however, is an extremely challenging task as there is usually only very limited quantities of material available to perform targeted enrichment approaches. Here, an automated phosphopeptide enrichment protocol using the AssayMap Bravo platform was applied to MM tissues and assessed for performance. The strategy proved to be highly-sensitive, less prone to variability, less laborious than existing techniques and adequate for starting quantities at the microgram level. An Fe(III)-NTA-IMAC-based enrichment workflow was applied to a dilution series of MM tissue lysates. The workflow was efficient in terms of sensitivity, reproducibility and phosphosite localization; and from only 12.5 µg of sample, more than 1,000 phosphopeptides were identified. In addition, from 60 µg of protein material the number of identified phosphoproteins from individual MM samples was comparable to previous reports that used extensive fractionation methods. Our data set included key pathways that are involved in MM progression; such as MAPK, melanocyte development and integrin signaling. Moreover, tissue-specific immunological proteins were identified, that have not been previously observed in the proteome of MM-derived cell lines. In conclusion, this workflow is suitable to study large cohorts of clinical samples that demand automatic and careful handling.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lymph node""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""Q Exactive""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","Phosphopeptide enrichment, malignant melanoma phosphoproteomics, Bravo AssayMap, sensitivity, Fe(III)-IMAC.","Raw files were processed with Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Scientific).

Both the results of quantitative proteomics, metabolomics and acetylome showed overexpression of SIRT3 increased mitochondrial biogenesis and reversed the mitochondrial dysfunctions in ccRCC. We found SIRT3 could increase the activity of TFAM through modulation of TFAM transcription, degradation and acetylation level. The acetylation of TFAM K154 decreased while TFAM protein expression increased after SIRT3 overexpression. Further study revealed that SIRT3 could bind with TFAM, and decrease the acetylation of TFAM, promoting TFAM activity in mitochondrial biogenesis. Overall, our results present a new mechanism of SIRT3 in regulating mitochondrial functions, and the downregulation of SIRT3 in ccRCC lowers the activity of TFAM, subsequently inhibits the transcription of mitochondrial genes and mitochondrial biogenesis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""6x(13)C labeled residue"",""UNIMOD"":""188""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT"",""SILAC""]","clear cell renal cancer, SIRT3, proteomics, mitochondrial biogenesis, TFAM acetylation","The mass spectrometer was operated by Xcalibur 3.0 software in the data-dependent acquisition mode and top N of MS/MS scans at 35% normalized collision energy for TMT labeled peptides or 30% for acetylated peptides followed a single full-scan mass spectrum in the orbitrap (350-1550 m/z, 120,000 resolution).

OpenSWATH was performed using the tool OpenSWATHWorkflow with input files including the mzXML file, the TraML library file, and TraML file for iRT peptides. The false discovery rate for peptide identification was below 0.1%. High confidence peptide features from different samples were aligned using the algorithm TRansition of Identification Confidence (TRIC) (version r238), which is available from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/msproteomicstools or https://code.google.com/p/msproteomicstools/.

Protein quantification The concentration of each protein is quantified through the simultaneous measurement of several peptides. To optimize the protein quantification, we developed a new computational method, which combines maximally consistent peptides for each protein and excludes inconsistent (i.e. uncorrelated) peptides (Picotti et al., 2013). Given a set of peptides unambiguously assigned to a single protein, consistent peptides were selected using the following procedure: all pairwise correlations between all peptides of a protein across the samples were calculated at first. Peptide pairs with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of at least 0.3 were determined, resulting in clusters of correlated peptides. This procedure yielded one or more peptide clusters per protein. We used the largest cluster of each protein and we quantified the protein’s concentration as the average intensity across the peptides in that cluster. The minimum cluster size was set to 2 and proteins without a cluster of at least two correlated peptides were removed from the subsequent analysis. This procedure resulted in very robust concentration estimates for 1906 proteins with high correlation between technical replicates (R ≥ 0.95) and no missing values.  60 samples with 1,906 proteins quantified in each sample were clustered by heatmap in R. To further visualize the sample similarities, the protein intensity matrix was firstly turned to distance matrix by dist function, then turned to newick tree file by as.phylo function, and finally plotted by Figtree software.",2016-07-18,"[[""DOI:10.26508/lsa.201800042"",""PMID:30090875""]]"

We leverage the principle that most cell types, and even tissues, predominantly express a single principal isoform to set isoform-level mRNA-seq quantifications as priors to guide and improve allocation of footprints or peptides to isoforms.  Through tightly integrated mRNAseq, ribosome footprinting and/or LC-MS/MS proteomics we demonstrate that a principal isoform can be identified in over 80% of gene products in homogenous HEK293 cell culture and over 70% of proteins detected in complex human brain tissue.  Defining isoforms in experiments with matched RNA-seq and translatomic/proteomic data increases the functional relevance of such datasets and will further broaden our understanding of multi-level control of gene expression.     In this PRIDE submission you will find the raw files for the HEK293 cell proteomics.  Files for the human brain proteomics can be found at PXD005445.

Also included in this ‘target’ database were CRAPome43 sequences of likely contaminants (such as Bovine Albumin). Spectra obtained from the Orbitrap Elite, in proprietary ThermoFisher ‘.raw’ files, were processed using MaxQuant44 (v1.5.2.1).  Peptides were searched using “trypsin/P” as the digestion enzyme, with a tolerance for up to 2 missed cleavages.  This search included a fixed modification, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and two variable modifications, N-acetylation and methionine oxidation.  MaxQuant default options were used for mass tolerance; 20 ppm for precursor ions, and 0.5 Da for fragment ions.  MaxQuant defaults of FDR corrected p of 0.01 was used for both peptide spectral match and protein identification. The standard peptides.txt output file from MaxQuant was used as input. Spectra were searched against these transcriptome-derived protein sequences, common contaminant sequences, and a library of reverse ‘decoy’ sequences45.   The distribution of expectation values for spectra with legitimate database hits was compared to the equivalent distribution for spectra assigned to the reverse ‘decoy’ database and a [maximum] expectation threshold was selected for each sample that limited the false discovery rate (FDR) to 1%.  I.e. 1% of spectra below this expectation value mapped to the reverse database while 99% mapped to the real database. Peptides that mapped to more than one distinct genomic locus or to contaminant sequences were discarded from further analysis, however this is not to be confused with peptides assigned to multiple potential isoforms of the same gene which were retained. It is worth noting that many of the peptides identified using the SWISS-Prot reference could be assigned to multiple distinct genes and thus constituted much of the data loss attributed with the use of this reference (data not shown). The transcriptome-derived reference did not suffer as much from multi-mapping, due mainly to less ambiguous gene-isoform relationships. The analysis described below performs a second round of FDR correction based on decoy mappings and discards multi-locus mapping sequences.

Using this metric and the resulting position-weight-matrix (PWM) of the footprint size vs. codon offset we can infer that the result of incomplete RNase digestion, which will likely differ between footprint preparations, tends to leave additional nucleotides at the 3’ end of the footprint (Figure S4a).  We can also use the PWM of read-mids to codon-offsets from single isoform genes to allow the reads to decide for themselves the optimal translation frame for each coding sequence and then ask, as a function of the number of reads mapped to a transcript, what fraction of transcripts are called in the correct frame.

In this report, we use our clickable glutathione approach, which form clickable glutathione (azido-glutathione) by using a mutant of glutathione synthetase (GS M4), for detection and identification of protein glutathionylation in response to glucose starvation. We found that protein glutathionylation is readily induced in response to glucose starvation when mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) are elevated in cells, and glucose is the major determinant for inducing reversible glutathionylation.

The pathogenic factors contributing to this disorder are inflammation, extracellular matrix degradation and failure to rebuild the articular cartilage. Preclinical studies suggest that microRNA-140 (miR-140) may play a protective role in osteoarthritis development, but little is known about the mechanism by which this may occur. Here we present the results of overexpression of miR-140 in an in vitro model of osteoarthritis, evaluated by global proteomics analysis. We show that inflammation is reduced through the differential synthesis of multiple proteins involved in the nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NFKB) pathway, articular cartilage regeneration may be induced through the upregulation of many of the components involved in the synthesis of hyaline extracellular matrix, and cartilage degeneration may be reduced through the reduced expression of aggrecanases. Thus, miR-140 overexpression may have a beneficial effect on the development of osteoarthritis through the differential synthesis of a surprisingly large number of proteins involved in all three pathogenic processes.

A deeper understanding of the molecular biology of cancer has resulted in better targeted therapies, where one or multiple drugs are adopted in novel therapies to tackle resistance. This beneficial effect of using combination treatments has to some extent also been observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation, whereby dual inhibition of BRAF(V600E) and EGFR increases antitumor activity. Notwithstanding this success, it is not clear whether this combination treatment is the only or most effective treatment to block resistance. Here, we investigate molecular responses upon single and multi-target treatments, over time, using BRAF(V600E) mutant CRC cells as a well-define model system. Through integration of transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomics data we obtain a comprehensive overview, revealing both well-known and novel responses.

Strikingly, heterozygous loss of function mutations in SALL4 result in a human developmental condition that phenocopies thalidomide induced birth defects such as absence of thumbs, phocomelia, defects in ear and eye development, and congenital heart disease.

Repeat expansions in C9ORF72, the major cause of ALS, reduce C9ORF72 levels but how this impacts stress granules is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that C9ORF72 associates with the autophagy receptor p62 and controls elimination of stress granules by autophagy. This requires p62 to associate via the Tudor protein SMN with proteins, including FUS, that are symmetrically arginine-methylated by PRMT5. Mice lacking p62 accumulate arginine-methylated proteins and alterations in FUS-dependent splicing.  Finally, patients with C9ORF72 repeat expansions accumulate symmetric arginine dimethylated proteins which co-localize with p62.

Reporter ion intensities were bias corrected for the overlapping isotope contributions from the iTRAQ tags according to the certificate of analysis provided by the reagent manufacturer (Sciex). The peptide and protein selection criteria for relative quantitation were performed as follows. Only peptides unique for a given protein were considered for relative quantitation, excluding those common to other isoforms or proteins of the same family. Proteins were identified on the basis of having at least one peptide with an ion score above 99% confidence. Among the identified peptides, some of them were excluded from the quantitative analysis for one of the following reasons: (i) The peaks corresponding to the iTRAQ labels were not detected; (ii) the peptides were identified with low identification confidence (<1.0%); (iii) the sum of the signal-to-noise ratio for all of the peak pairs was <6 for the peptide ratios. The protein sequence coverage (95% conf.) was estimated for specific proteins by the percentage of matching amino acids from the identified peptides having confidence greater than or equal to 95% divided by the total number of amino acids in the sequence. Several quantitative estimates provided for each protein by ProteinPilot were utilized: the fold change ratios of differential expression between labelled protein extracts; the p-value, representing the probability that the observed ratio is different than 1 by chance. A decoy database search strategy was also used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR), defined as the percentage of decoy proteins identified against the total protein identification. The FDR was calculated by searching the spectra against the decoy database generated from the target database. The results were then exported into Excel for manual data interpretation.

A striking feature of this disease is that a range of different mutations in ribosomal proteins results in similar disease phenotypes primarily characterized by erythrocyte abnormalities and macrocytic anemia, while most other cell types are minimally affected. Previously, we analyzed the erythrocyte membrane proteomes of several DBA patients and identified several proteins that are not typically associated with this cell type that suggested inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of DBA.  In this study, we evaluated the erythrocyte cytosolic proteome of DBA patients through in-depth analysis of hemoglobin-depleted erythrocyte cytosol.  The simple, reproducible, hemoglobin depletion using nickel columns enabled in-depth analysis of over 1000 cytosolic erythrocyte proteins with minimal subsequent fractionation of the proteome.  Label-free quantitation and statistical analysis identified 29 proteins that were significantly changed in DBA patients compared to matched healthy control donors.  Some of the proteins that were significantly increased in DBA erythrocyte cytoplasm included three proteasome subunit beta proteins that make up the immunoproteasome and proteins induced by interferon-γ such as n-myc interactor and interferon-induced 25 kDa protein [NMI and IFI35 respectively].  Pathway analysis confirmed the presence of an inflammatory signature with erythrocytes of DBA patients and predicted key upstream regulators including mitogen activated kinase 1, interferon-γ, tumor suppressor p53, and tumor necrosis factor.  These results show that erythrocytes in DBA patients are intrinsically different from those in healthy controls which may be due to an inflammatory response resulting from the inherent molecular defect of ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency or changes in the bone marrow microenvironment that leads to red cell aplasia in DBA patients.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","Human, erythrocyte, LC-MS/MS","Raw data was processed through the MaxQuant Software package (Ver. 1.4.0.8).

These methods rely on the use of several broadband isolation windows that select and fragment all peptide ions within a cycle. Isolation windows differ in that (I) they exhibit different widths, (ii) they are acquired either sequentially or in a non-consecutive order, and (iii) they are either juxtaposed or overlapped. Here we present DIA+, a novel DIA multiplexing scheme with isolation windows that combine signals from identical peptides with different charges. DIA+ is based on the co-isolation of charge +2 and +3 precursor ions from identical peptide sequences to combine their signal and therefore, increase the number of MS2 peptide fragment ions detected. DIA+ combines three non-consecutive m/z ranges, based on the mass difference between charge +2 and +3 peptides, into a composite 24 Da isolation window. Forty of these combined 24 Da windows cover a range of 400-1350 m/z. The performance of DIA+ was compared with other reference methods in the field, and with a DIA+ control method in which each 24 Da isolation window results from the combination of three consecutive m/z ranges. The combination of improved signal-to-noise and sequence coverage increases the confidence on peptide identification and results in a significant increase in the number of identified peptides and proteins.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Technical""]","[""SWATH MS""]",,"DIA, Hela",Data was analyzed using DIA Umpire v2.1 with the search engine Comet.

Histone 4 Lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) serves a unique role amongst the many histone modifications as it directly affects chromatin structure1. The Male Specific Lethal (MSL) complex associated MOF/KAT8 histone acetyl transferase is responsible for bulk H4K16ac in flies and mammals. Yet, its importance during human development and a potential involvement in human pathologies remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover that pathogenic variants in MSL3, a component of the MSL complex, are causative for a new recognizable X-linked syndrome affecting Histone 4 Lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) in both male and female individuals. Common clinical features of the syndrome include global developmental delay comprising profound speech delay, delayed ability to walk and craniofacial dysmorphism. Using patient-derived primary fibroblasts, we demonstrate that de novo variants or deletions of MSL3 affect the assembly and enzymatic activity of the MSL complex, hence impacting on global H4K16ac levels. Transcriptome analysis from patient cells showed misregulation of cellular pathways involved in serotonergic signaling, morphogenesis, axon guidance and cell structure. Finally, using HDAC inhibitor treatment, we can rescue expression of downregulated target genes, offering potential therapeutic avenues for MSL3-mutated patients. Taken together, we characterize a novel syndrome, named ILyADe (Impaired Lysine 16 acetylation associated disorder), which is caused by mutations of an epigenetic regulator, allowing us for the first time to unravel the crucial role of H4K16ac during human development. ILyaDe thus constitutes a new class of syndromes associated with misregulation of a single epigenetic modification caused by a genetic alteration.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""skin"",""cell suspension culture""]","[{""ptm"":""trimethyl-L-arginine"",""UNIMOD"":""37#R""},{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monomethylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""34""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"",""Epigenetic Chromatin (B/D-HPP)"",""Human Proteome Project"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]","[""Label free""]","MSL3, X-linked syndrome, histone H4, acetylation, lysine 16","MaxQuant software (version 1.6.0.16) was used for raw file peak extraction and protein identification.

Recently, naturally occurring circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been revealed to function as efficient microRNA sponges. We hypothesized that synthetic circRNA sponges targeting oncomiRs could be constructed and used to achieve potentially therapeutic microRNA loss of function. In this study, linear RNA molecules containing five miR-21 binding sites were transcribed in vitro. After dephosphorylation by calf intestinal phosphatase and phosphorylation by T4 polynucleotide kinase, circRNA sponges were circularized using 5’-3’ end ligation by T4 RNA ligase 1. Synthetic circular sponge stability was assayed in the presence of RNase R or fetal bovine serum. Luciferase reporter and cell proliferation assays were performed to assess competitive inhibition of miR-21 activity by circRNA sponges in NCI-N87 gastric cancer cells. Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling proteomics analysis and Western blotting were performed to delineate effects of circRNA sponges on miR-21 downstream targeted proteins. Our experiments revealed that artificial circRNA sponges can be synthesized using enzymatic ligation. These synthetic circRNA sponges are more resistant than their linear RNA counterparts to nuclease degradation in vitro. They effectively suppress the activity of miR-21 on its downstream protein targets, including the important cancer protein DAXX. Finally, they also inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation.

To investigate changes in blood proteins after stroke and as a result of thrombolysis treatment we performed label-free quantitative proteomics on serum samples using high resolution mass spectrometry and long HPLC gradient (5 hours) combined with a 50cm column to optimize the peptide separation. We identified (FDR: 1%) and quantified a total of 574 protein groups from a total of 92 samples from 30 patients. Ten patients were treated by thrombolysis as part of a randomised placebo controlled trial and up to five samples were collected from each individual at different time points after stroke. We identified 26 proteins differently expressed by treatment group (FDR: 5%) and significant changes of expression over time for 23 proteins (FDR: 10%). Molecules such as fibrinogen and CRP showed expression profiles with a high potential clinical utility in the acute stroke setting.  Protein expression profiles vary acutely in the blood after stroke and have the potential to allow the construction of a stroke clock and to have an impact on IS treatment decision making.,"[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood serum""]","[{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, ischemic stroke, serum","Identification and label free quantitation of proteins across all 92 samples was performed using MaxQuant version 1.5.0.30 (Cox and Mann 2008).

PXD011456,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD011456,Global analysis of methionine oxidation provides a census of folding stabilities for the human proteome,"Most natural proteins fold into a native conformation stabilized by non-covalent interactions. The energy difference between native and denatured states (Gfolding) is highly variable between proteins and can range from less than -10 kcal per mole for highly stable proteins to positive values for intrinsically disordered proteins. Folding stability is a dynamic property of proteins and can be modulated by molecular chaperones and binding interactions. The stability of a protein influences its tendency to aggregate, degrade or become covalently modified in cells. Despite its significance to understanding protein folding and function, quantitative analyses of thermodynamic stability have been mostly limited to small soluble proteins in purified systems. Here, we have used a highly multiplexed bottom-up proteomics approach, based on analyses of rates of methionine oxidation, to quantify the thermodynamic stabilities of the human proteome in crude extracts obtained from dermal fibroblasts. Our data provide structural and stability information for more than 10,000 unique regions and domains within more than 3,200 proteins. The data identifies lysosomal and extracellular proteins as the most stable ontological subsets of the proteome. We show that the stability of proteins can impact their tendency to become oxidized and are globally altered by the osmolyte trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). We also show that most proteins designated as IDPs retain their unfolded structure in the complex milieu of the cell and most cannot be refolded by TMAO. Together, the data provide a census of the stability of the human proteome and validate a methodology for global analysis of protein thermodynamic stabilities.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"",""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","Human, protein stability, protein folding, quantitative proteomics, methionine oxidation, Lumos","All MS2 data were searched against the H. sapiens UniProt database (20975 entries, downloaded 6/18/2017) using the integrated Andromeda search engine with MaxQuant software.

Immunotherapy of GBM is a potentially beneficial treatment option, whose optimal implementation may depend on familiarity with tumor specific antigens, presented as HLA peptides by the GBM cells. Furthermore, early detection of GBM, such as by a routine blood test, may improve survival, even with the current treatment modalities. This study includes large-scale analyses of the HLA peptidome (immunopeptidome) of the plasma-soluble HLA molecules (sHLA) of 142 plasma samples and the membranal HLA of GBM tumors of 10 tumor samples of the same patients. Tumor samples were fresh-frozen immediately after surgery and plasma samples were collected before, and at multiple visits after surgery. In total, this HLA peptidome analysis involved 52 different HLA allotypes and resulted in the identification of more than 35,000 different HLA peptides. Strong correlations were observed in the signal intensities and in the repertoires of identified peptides between the tumors and plasma-soluble HLA peptidomes of the same patients; yet, low correlations were observed between these HLA peptidomes and the tumors’ proteomes. HLA peptides derived from Cancer/Testis Antigens (CTAs) were selected based on their presence among the HLA peptidomes of the patients and absence of expression of their source genes from any healthy and essential human tissues, except from immune-privileged sites. Additionally, peptides were selected as potential biomarkers if their levels in the plasma-sHLA peptidome were significantly reduced after the removal of tumor mass. The CTAs identified among the analyzed HLA peptidomes provide new opportunities for personalized immunotherapy and for early diagnosis of GBM.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""brain""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]","[""Label free""]","HLA peptidome, Glioblastoma, mHLA, sHLA,early detection, plasma","Data Analysis: The MS data was analyzed by the MaxQuant computational proteomics platform version 1.5.3.8 and searched with the Andromeda search engine.

Current diagnosis of HF relies on clinical evaluation, blood assays and imaging techniques at the time of diagnosis. Our aim is to develop a diagnostic assay to detect HF early in at risk individuals within the community using human saliva as a medium, paving the way towards precision medicine.  Methods: Saliva samples were collected from healthy controls (n=36) and HF patients (n=75). Salivary proteome profiles were analysed by Sequential Window Acquisition of All Theoretical fragment ion spectra – Mass Spectrometry (SWATH-MS). A total of 738 proteins were quantified and 177 proteins demonstrated significant differences in saliva from HF patients and healthy controls.  Candidate biomarkers were chosen based on their abundance and difference between the two cohorts. A multi-protein panel was developed using logistic regression analysis. The diagnostic performance of the multi-protein panel was assessed using the receiver operative characteristic curves. The candidate proteins were further validated technically, using western blot analysis as well as biologically, using an independent cohor.t. Results: A group of six proteins were chosen as potential protein candidates based on their differences in the abundance between the two cohorts. During the validation phase, two of the proteins were eliminated as these did not meet our criteria. The panel consists of four proteins with sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 62.5% with an area under ROC curve of 0.78 in discriminating healthy controls from NYHA class I/II HF patients.

The apoptotic phenotype and mechanism by which it induces cell death however, remain poorly understood and controversial. Here, we show that GrM-induced cell death was largely caspase-dependent with various hallmarks of classical apoptosis, coinciding with caspase-independent G2/M cell cycle arrest. Using positional proteomics in HeLa cells, we identified the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase II alpha (topoII alpha) as a physiological substrate of GrM. Cleavage of topoII alpha by GrM at Leu1280 dissected topoII aplha functional domains from the nuclear localization signals, leading to nuclear exit of topoII alpha catalytic activity into the cytoplasm, and rendering it nonfunctional. Similar to the apoptotic phenotype of GrM, topoII aplha depletion in tumor cells led to cell cycle arrest in G2/M, mitochondrial perturbations, caspase activation, and apoptosis. We conclude that cytotoxic lymphocyte GrM targets topoII aplha to trigger cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis.  Raw data files were processed with Mascot distiller 2.3.

As OPSCCs are often diagnosed at an advanced stage, mortality and morbidity remain high. There are no diagnostic biomarkers for early stage detection of OPSCC.  Serum from 25 patients with stage I-II OPSCC and 12 disease- individuals were studied with quantitative label-free proteomics using ultra-definition MSE. Statistical analyses were performed to identify proteins most reliably distinguishing early stage OPSCCs from controls. P16 was used as a surrogate marker for HPV. P16-positive and -negative tumours were also analysed separately.  With two or more unique proteins per identification, 176 proteins were quantified. A clear separation between patients with early-stage tumours and controls was seen in principal component analysis. Latent structures discriminant analysis identified 96 proteins most reliably differentiating OPSCC patients from controls, with 13 upregulated and 83 downregulated in study cases. The set of proteins was studied further with network, pathway and protein-protein interaction analyses, and found to participate in e.g. lipid metabolism.  We identified patients with early stage OPSCC from controls based on their serum proteome, and suggest a protein set for further evaluation as a diagnostic biomarker panel for OPSCC.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood serum""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Synapt MS""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""MSE""]",,Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma; serum proteomics; multivariate data analysis; Complement factor H-related protein 2; Myosin regulatory light chain 12A,"The data analysis is described previously in detail (Saraswat et al, 2017a).

We previously showed that naturally occurring peptides of collagen type I were elevated in the urine of patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). CRLM tissue was compared to healthy adjacent liver tissue (controls) using high resolution mass spectrometry. Twenty-two different collagen alpha chains were identified, 19 of which were significantly upregulated (P<0.05) in CRLM tissue compared with control tissue. We observed expression of four collagen alpha chains which were absent or low expressed in healthy colon and control tissue, but were highly present in CRC and CRLM tissues analyzed. This expression pattern was also observed for six non-collagen colon specific proteins. Two of these proteins (CDH17 and PPP1R1B/DARP-32) were not known to be differently expressed in CRLM in comparison to healthy liver tissue. Furthermore, 16 of 20 identified proteins related to collagen synthesis were upregulated, indicating increased synthesis of collagen in CRLM. Cross-validation of the mass spectrometry data with immunohistochemistry for collagen type XII confirmed the significant upregulation of collagen type XII in CRLM. This study shows that the majority of collagen types are upregulated in CRLM compared to control tissue most likely as a result of an increased collagen turnover and changes in the collagen supramolecular structure. This research provides further understanding of morphologic changes in extracellular matrix of CRLM and the finding of proteins and peptides that might be specific for tumor metastasis in liquid biopsies.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""liver"",""colon""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,Collagen Mass spectrometry Proteomics Colorectal liver metastasis,"The MS/MS spectra were identified using the Mascot search engine (version 2.3.2, Matrix Science Inc., London, UK) as described by Singh et al (16).

Currently, little is known about the molecular pathogenesis and no direct genotype-phenotype relationship has yet been confirmed. Since DS amniocytes are expected to have a distinct biological behaviour compared to normal amniocytes, we hypothesise that relative quantification of proteins produced from trisomy and euploid (chromosomally normal) amniocytes will reveal dysregulated molecular pathways.

PXD006996,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006996,Bacterial pore-forming toxins remodel the host epithelial cell proteome,"Bacterial pathogens use various strategies to interfere with host cell functions. Among these strategies, bacteria induce transcriptional changes, in order to modify the set of proteins synthetized by the host cell, or target pre-existing proteins by modulating their post-translational modifications or by triggering their degradation. Protein levels variations in host cells during infection integrates both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations induced by pathogens. Here, we focused on host proteome alterations induced by the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and more specifically the Listeria toxin Listeriolysin O (LLO).  In order to characterize host proteome alterations induced by LLO, we performed a shotgun proteomics analysis on HeLa cells treated or not with the LLO toxin. To this end, we used SILAC labelling (stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture) to compared in a quantitative manner the protein content from two differentially treated cell populations: one control population and one population incubated with a sublytic dose of LLO (3 nM). We decided to expose cells to LLO during only 20 min to limit protein level changes resulting from transcriptional changes. We performed two independent experiments (experiment #1 and experiment #2) with swapped SILAC labelling to rule out putative labelling-dependent effects. A total of 2009 and 2577 proteins was quantified in each independent experiment, respectively, and 1834 proteins were quantified in both experiments. Among these 1834 proteins, we identified a total of 151 proteins for which protein levels were consistently decreased in cells treated with LLO (i.e. with a log2 control/LLO ratio >0.5 in both experiments). To assess whether the host proteasome was involved in the decrease of these 151 proteins, we repeated our proteomics analysis on SILAC-labelled HeLa cells pre-treated with proteasome inhibitors before exposure to LLO. Two independent experiments were similarly performed with swapped SILAC labelling (experiment #3 and experiment #4). Interestingly, we observed that the vast majority of host proteins identified as strongly downregulated in response to LLO also displayed significant decreased levels in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that the majority of observed decreases in host protein levels induced by LLO are not due to proteasome-mediated degradation. In follow-up experiments, we validated that LLO decreases in particular the protein level of two E2 ubiquitin enzymes, UBE2K and UBE2N, leading to major changes in the host ubiquitylome. This toxin-induced proteome remodeling involves post-transcriptional regulations, as no modification in the transcription levels of the corresponding genes was observed. These decreases in host protein levels were observed in different epithelial cell lines but not in macrophages. In addition, we could show that Perfringolysin O, another bacterial pore-forming toxin similar to LLO, also induces host proteome changes. Taken together, our data show that different bacterial pore-forming toxins induce deep proteome remodeling, that may impair host epithelial cell functions.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","listeriolysin O, listeria, infection","Data analysis was performed with MaxQuant (version 1.5.6.5) using the Andromeda search engine with default search settings including a false discovery rate set at 1% on both the peptide and protein level.

The resulting peptide mixtures were resuspended in 5% formic acid and separated on a capillary column (C18 PepMap 300, 75 μm × 100 mm, 3-μm particle size, Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) mounted in line with a pre-column (EASY- Column C18, 100 μm × 20 mm, 5-μm particle size, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) on a Proxeon Easy-LC II system (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark). Solutions of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile were used as the mobile phases. A gradient from 2 to 35% acetonitrile was performed in 90 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Eluted peptides were analyzed using a linear ion trap-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo Scientific). The LTQ-Orbitrap was operated in data-dependent mode in which one full MS scan was followed by MS/MS scan with dynamic exclusion set to: 1 repeat count, 15 seconds exclusion duration and 500 exclusion list size. MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap in the range from 250 to 2,000 m/z, with a resolution of 60,000 (full- width at half-maximum). The 7 most intense ions per scan were submitted to MS/MS fragmentation (35% Normalized Collision EnergyTM) and detected in the linear ion trap. The capillary temperature was set at 200 °C, spray voltage was 1.6 kV, and capillary voltage was 36 V.

PXD009453,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009453,TAILS N-Terminomics and Proteomics Show Complex Regulation of Proteolytic Processing by O-glycosylation,"Proteolytic processing is an irreversible post-translational modification functioning as a ubiquitous regulator of cellular activity. Protease activity is tightly regulated by control of gene expression, compartmentalisation of enzyme and substrate, zymogen activation, enzyme inactivation, and substrate availability. Emerging evidence suggests that proteolysis can also be regulated by substrate glycosylation and that glycosylation of individual sites on a substrate can decrease, or in rare cases, increase its sensitivity to proteolysis. In the present study we investigated the relationship between site-specific O-glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage of extracellular proteins. By in silico analysis we found a significant association between O-glycosylation sites and cleavage sites. We then used a positional proteomic strategy, Terminal Amine Isotopic Labelling of Substrates (TAILS) to map in vivo cleavage sites in HepG2 cells with and without one of the key initiating GalNAc-transferases, GalNAc-T2. To reduce complexity, the comparison were performed in so-called SimpleCells. In these cells the Core 1 β3-galactosyltransferase-specific molecular chaperone (COSMC; C1GALT1C1) has been knocked out, resulting in global truncation of O-glycans leaving only the initial GalNAc. Surprisingly, we found that loss of GalNAc-T2 resulted in not only an increase in cleavage, but also a decrease in cleavage across a broad range of other substrates, including key regulators of the protease network. GALNT2 has previously been identified as a candidate gene for dyslipidaemia and has been shown to specifically glycosylate central regulators of lipid homeostasis, here we find altered processing of several of these regulators including Apolipoproteins B (ApoB) and the Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), providing new clues to the link between GALNT2 and lipid homeostasis. In contrast to the findings from the majority of previous studies, these results indicate that O-glycosylation can both decrease and increase substrate cleavage. We challenged this system with exogenous matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and neutrophil elastase and observed substantial changes to the neutrophil elastase N-terminome, but no evidence for a similar role for MMP9. Overall, we show that loss of O-glycosylation leads to a general decrease in cleavage, that GalNAc-T2 O-glycosylation affects key regulators of the cellular proteolytic network, including multiple members of the Serpin family.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""O-(N-acetylamino)hexosyl-L-threonine"",""UNIMOD"":""43#T""},{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""O-(N-acetylamino)hexosyl-L-serine"",""UNIMOD"":""43#S""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion ETD"",""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]","[""Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"",""Glycoproteomics (B/D-HPP)"",""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Human, LC-MSMS, O-glycoproteomics, Degradomics, TAILS","Data Analysis. Raw data were analysed using Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer 2.1 software and searched against the UniProt KB/SwissProt-reviewed database downloaded on July 8, 2010, containing 20,212 entries. An additional fasta file containing contaminants obtained from a common repository at the Max Planck Institute was included in the search: (http://www.matrixscience.com/help/ seq_db_setup_contaminants.html). HCD data were searched using the SEQUEST HT node in PD 2.1. In all cases, the precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance to 50 millimass units. Carbamidomethylation (+57.021 Da) of cysteine and dimethyl labelling (light: +28.031 Da, heavy: +34.069 Da) of lysine were set as static modifications. Dimethylation of the protein N termini, acetylation of protein N termini (+42.011), formation of pyroglutamate on peptide N termini (+17.027) and methionine oxidation (+15.996Da) were considered dynamic modifications. The search was conducted using semi-specific trypsin cleavage with up to two missed cleavages. All spectra were searched against non-decoy and decoy databases to allow calculation of the false discovery rate. Afterwards, percolator was used to calculate the local false discovery rate and a threshold FDR of 1% was applied at the peptide level. Data were subsequently analysed R. The technical variance was measured by comparison of two identical non-treated samples (Figure 3). The samples were differentially labelled and compared using TAILS; in the ideal scenario, quantitation of the two fractions should result in a heavy:light ratio of 1.0 for all quantified N-termini peptides. A deviation from this ratio represents the technical error associated with TAILS enrichment and quantitation by LC23 MS/MS. From this analysis 98% of peptides were quantified with a less than 2-fold change (H:L ratio range log(2) -0.73 to 0.21) indicating good technical replication. Subsequently, internal tryptic peptide dimethyl ratios were combined by sample type and used to define significant outlier cut-offs by box-and-whisker plot analysis using the BoxPlotR72 tool as previously described73 (coefficient = 1). Final log(2) upper and lower threshold values were 1.52 and -1.69 respectively. These results are in agreement with previously reported lower limits of detection for dimethyl quantitation and TAILS experiments.11,74 Peptide Maps. Data for proteins containing quantified N-termini were subsequently mapped onto protein schematics using R to produce a peptide map summarising total quantitation from all experiments. These barcodes provide a visual method for assessing the changes detected in each treatment group. Two separate analyses were performed to obtain these data: as MMP9 and neutrophil elastase specific effects were only a small portion of the total dataset, the analysis was repeated by combining all experimental groups to generate treatment-independent quantification. These data are represented by the ‘shotgun’ and ‘all’ rows in the peptide map. Substrate winnowing. Correctly mapped peptides designated as outliers were subjected to a substrate winnowing process to separately identify protease dependent and independent targets. Only peptides identified in ≥ 2 spectra were considered and peptides identified with variable N-termini forms (for example a peptide identified with both an N-terminal dimethyl and N-terminal pyroglutamate label in the same sample) were excluded due to the uncertainty in quantitation of these species. Protease independent targets were defined as outlier peptides identified across multiple treatment groups, whereas protease dependent targets were defined as high-confidence targets uniquely identified in that treatment group. Peptides quantified only in one channel were only accepted for further consideration if they were identified by ≥ 2 high quality spectra. Such peptides were deemed singlets and assigned a ratio of 1:50 based on the channel in which they were identified. Of the remaining peptides ~50% of treatment-independent and 65% of treatment dependent (MMP9 or neutrophil elastase) substrates were known O-glycoproteins. Substrates passing these quality checks are listed in the candidate peptides tables in the main text.

Large-scale proteomic profiling studies of these lesions are also non-existent.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate proteomic changes between normal epidermis, AK, BD and cSCC that could support a molecular classification and improve our understanding of disease progression.  METHODS: Microdissected formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples of normal epidermis (n = 4, pooled), AK (n = 10), BD (n = 10) and cSCC (n = 10) were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Following normalization and multiple testing adjustments, differential abundance analysis was performed using Linear Models for Microarray data. Proteins were filtered for significance (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05) and fold change of at least ±1.5. Comparative bioinformatics analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Proteomic findings were subsequently substantiated using immunohistochemistry.  RESULTS: 2073 unique proteins were identified. cSCC had the highest number of differentially abundant proteins (63 proteins) followed by BD (58 proteins) and AK (46 proteins). Six proteins (APOA1, ALB, SERPINA1, HLA-B, HP and TXNDC5) were differentially abundant in cSCC compared to AK. Immunohistochemical analysis corroborated changes in MIF, RPL37A and TXNDC5. IPA analysis predicted that cell proliferation, angiogenesis and inflammatory reactions were significantly activated in cSCC compared to BD and AK. Cell death and DNA damage were predicted to be inhibited in BD.  CONCLUSION: Our study supports the concept that AK and BD are precursors of cSCC. The identification of proteome changes indicates disruption of repair, pro-apoptotic, and tumor promoting pathways. Our findings will help select targets for classification and treatment.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""skin""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Spectrum counting""]",Actinic keratosis; Bowen’s disease; Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; Mass spectrometry-based proteomics,"MS/MS data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer™ software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, version: 2.1.0.81).

We found over-expression of wild-type (WT) or F115C mutant MATR3 had little impact on gene expression in neuroglia cells. We identified ~123 proteins that bound MATR3, with proteins associated with stress granules and RNA processing/splicing being prominent. The interactome of myopathic S85C and ALS-variant F115C MATR3 were virtually identical to WT protein. Deletion of RNA recognition motif (RRM1) or Zn finger motifs (ZnF1 or ZnF2) diminished the binding of a subset of MATR3 interacting proteins. Remarkably, deletion of the RRM2 motif caused enhanced binding of >100 hundred proteins. In live cells, MATR3 lacking RRM2 (ΔRRM2) formed intranuclear spherical structures that fused over time into large structures. Our findings in the cell models used here suggest that MATR3 with disease-causing mutations is not dramatically different from WT protein in modulating gene regulation or in binding to normal interacting partners. The intra-nuclear localization and interaction network of MATR3 is strongly modulated by its RRM2 domain.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""ubiquitination signature dipeptidyl lysine"",""UNIMOD"":""121#K""},{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"",""UNIMOD"":""28#Q""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]","[""Spectrum counting""]","Matrin 3, interaction","All MS/MS samples were analyzed using Mascot (Version 2.40).

Dysfunction of WAT cells is associated with obesity associated disorders like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Resveratrol (RSV) a natural polyphenolic compound mimics beneficial effects of calorie restriction. As such, RSV seems a promising therapeutic target for obesity-associated disorders. The effect of RSV on the human adipokine profile is still elusive. Therefore, a proteomic study together with bioinformatical analysis was performed to investigate the effect of RSV on the secretion profile of mature human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes. RSV incubation resulted in elevated basal glycerol release and reduced intracellular TG content. This increased intracellular lipolysis was accompanied by profound changes in the adipocyte secretion profile. Extracellular matrix proteins were down-regulated while processing proteins were mostly up-regulated after RSV treatment. Interestingly, RSV induced secretion of proteins protective against cellular stress and proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, we found a RSV-induced up-regulation of adiponectin and ApoE accompanied by a down-regulation of PAI-1 and PEDF secretion which may improve anti-inflammatory processes and increased insulin sensitivity. These effects are beneficial to alleviate obesity-induced metabolic complications.

We now report that silencing of the Hippo pathway tumor suppressors LATS1 and LATS2 in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells reduces p53 phosphorylation and increases its  association with the p52 NF-κB subunit. Moreover, it partly shifts p53’s conformation and transcriptional output towards a state resembling cancer-associated p53 mutants,  and endow p53 with the ability to promote cell migration.

This utilizes mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics to characterize the global impact of an oncogene on the expressed kinome, and then functionally annotates the regulated kinases. As an example, we identified approximately one hundred protein kinases exhibiting altered expression and/or phosphorylation in Src-transformed mammary epithelial cells. Screening with corresponding siRNAs identified nine kinases, including SGK1, as being essential for Src-induced transformation. In contrast, MAP4K5 suppressed transformation in a manner enhanced by S335 phosphorylation. In triple negative breast cancer cells, Src positively regulated SGK1 expression and combined inhibition of Src and SGK1 was more effective at inhibiting cell proliferation than either treatment alone.

PXD009300,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009300,Proteomic Distinction of Renal Oncocytomas and Eosinophilic Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinomas,"Background Renal oncocytomas (ROs) are benign epithelial tumors of the kidney that may progress into malignant chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCCs), with the latter constituting 5 – 7 % of renal neoplasias. ROs and chRCCs show pronounced molecular and histological similarities, which renders their differentiation demanding. We aimed for the differential proteome profiling of ROs and chRCCs in order to better understand distinguishing protein patterns.   Methods We employed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples (six RO cases, six chRCC cases) together with isotopic triplex dimethylation and a pooled reference standard to enable cohort-wide quantitative comparison. For lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and integrin alpha-V (ITGAV) we performed corroborative immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an extended cohort of 42 RO cases and 31 chRCC cases lacking any overlap with the smaller proteomic cohort.  Results: At 1 % false discovery rate, we identified > 3900 proteins, of which >2400 proteins were consistently quantified in at least four RO and four chRCC cases. The proteomic expression profiling discriminated ROs and chRCCs and highlighted established features such as accumulation of mitochondrial proteins in ROs together with emphasizing the accumulation of endo-lysosomal proteins in chRCCs. In line with the proteomic data, IHC showed enrichment of LAMP1 in chRCC and of ITGAV in RO.   Conclusion We present one of the first differential proteome profiling studies on ROs and chRCCs and highlight differential abundance of LAMP1 and ITGAV in these renal tumors.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""kidney""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"renal cell tumors formalin-fixation, paraffin embedment proteomics immunohistochemistry","MS data were analyzed by MaxQuant version 1.5.28 [23] as described previously [19].

PXD000387,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000387,LC-MS/MS of gingiva and Periodontal ligaments,"Background: Although human gingival fibroblasts (hGF) and human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLF) exhibit numerous phenotypic similarities, it has been suggested that the secretory and behavioral differences, which exist between these cell types, are a result of the membrane protein composition of these cells.        Methods: Four matched pairs of hGF and hPDLF were cultured.  Prior to confluence, membrane bound and associated proteins from cells of the 4th passage were extracted.  The processed protein samples were identified by digestion with trypsin and sequenced using capillary-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on an Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer.  Scaffold by Proteome Software was used to quantitate and validate protein identifications derived from MS/MS sequencing results.        Results: Four hundred fifty proteins were common to both hGF and hPDLF.  Of the proteins identified, 214 were known membrane bound or associated proteins and 165 proteins were known nuclear associated proteins. Twenty-seven proteins, identified from the 450 proteins, common to both hGF and hPDLF, were detected in statistically significant greater quantities in either hGF or hPDLF.  More specifically, 13 proteins were detected in significantly greater quantities in hGF, while 14 proteins were detected in significantly greater quantities in hPDLF.        Conclusions:  Distinct differences in the cellular protein catalog may reflect the dynamic role and high energy requirements of hGF in extracellular matrix remodeling and response to inflammatory challenge as well as the role of hPDGF in monitoring mechanical stress and maintaining tissue homeostasis during regeneration and remineralization.        Method Details: Sequence information from the MS/MS data was processed by converting the .raw files into a merged file (.mgf) using an in-house program, RAW2MZXML_n_MGF_batch (merge.pl, a Perl script).  Isotope distributions for the precursor ions of the MS/MS spectra were deconvoluted to obtain the charge states and monoisotopic m/z values of the precursor ions during the data conversion. The resulting mgf files were searched using Mascot Daemon by Matrix Science version 2.3.2 (Boston, MA) and the database searched against the full SwissProt database version 2012_06 (536,489 sequences; 190,389,898 residues) or NCBI database version 20120515 (18,099,548 sequences; 6,208,559,787 residues The mass accuracy of the precursor ions were set to 20ppm, accidental pick of 13C peaks was also included into the search. The fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da.  Considered variable modifications were oxidation (Met), deamidation (N and Q) and carbamidomethylation (Cys). Four missed cleavages for the enzyme were permitted.  A decoy database was also searched to determine the false discovery rate (FDR) and peptides were filtered according to the FDR. The significance threshold was set at p less than 0.05 and bold red peptides is required for valid peptide identification. Proteins with a Mascot score of 50 or higher with a minimum of two unique peptides from one protein having a -b or -y ion sequence tag of five residues or better were accepted. Any modifications or low score peptide/protein identifications were manually checked for validation.         Spectral Counting: Label Free Quantitation was performed using the spectral counting approach. Scaffold (version Scaffold_3.4.9, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (Keller, A et al Anal. Chem. 2002;74(20):5383-92).  Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least 1 identified peptides.  Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii, AI Anal Chem. 2003 Sep 1;75(17):4646-58).

PXD000426,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000426,Asn3 mass accuracy jurkat proteome,"The use of internal calibrants (the so called lock mass approach) provides much greater accuracy in mass spectrometry based proteomics. However, the polydimethylcyclosiloxane (PCM) peaks commonly used for this purpose are quite unreliable, leading to missing calibrant peaks in spectra and correspondingly lower mass measurement accuracy. Therefore, we here introduce a universally applicable and robust internal calibrant, the tripeptide Asn3. We show that Asn3 is a substantial improvement over PCM both in terms of consistent detection and resulting mass measurement accuracy. Asn3 is also very easy to adopt in the lab, as it requires only minor adjustments to the analytical setup. Data analysis: For mass measurement accuracy (MMA) calculations and comparisons, the following Mascot workflow was used. From the MS/MS data in each LC run, Mascot Generic Files were created using Distiller software (version 2.4.3.3, Matrix Science, London, UK, www.matrixscience.com/distiller.html). These peak lists were then searched with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) using the Mascot Daemon interface (version 2.4.0, Matrix Science). Spectra were searched against the Swiss-Prot database (version 13_04 of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database containing 20,232 sequence entries of human proteins) concatenated with its reversed sequence database. Variable modifications were set to pyro-glutamate formation of amino terminal glutamine and acetylation of the protein N-terminus, whereas fixed modifications only included oxidation of methionine. Mass tolerance on peptide ions was set to 10 ppm (with Mascot’s C13 option set to 1), and the mass tolerance on peptide fragment ions was set to 20 millimass units (mmu), except for the space-charge effect experiment(LMA5)  where an extra search was done with a setting of 3 mmu. The peptide charge was set to 1+,2+,3+ and instrument setting was put on ESI-QUAD. Enzyme was set to trypsin allowing for one missed cleavage, and cleavage was allowed when arginine or lysine is followed by proline. Only peptides that were ranked one and scored above the threshold score, set at 99% confidence, were withheld.

This functional diversity relies on the ordered assembly of alternative PP1 holoenzymes. Here, we show that newly synthesized PP1 is first held in an inactive complex by its partners SDS22 and inhibitor-3 (I3) that needs to be disassembled by the p97 AAA-ATPase to promote exchange to substrate specifiers. Unlike p97-mediated degradative processes that require the Ufd1-Npl4 ubiquitin adapters, p97 is targeted to PP1 by p37 and related adapter proteins. Reconstitution with purified components revealed direct interaction of the p37 SEP domain with I3 without the need of ubiquitination, and ATP-driven pulling of I3 into the central channel of the p97 hexamer, which triggers dissociation of I3 and SDS22. Thus, we establish regulatory ubiquitin-independent protein complex disassembly as part of the functional arsenal of p97 and define an unanticipated essential step in PP1 biogenesis that illustrates the molecular challenges of ordered subunit exchange.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]",protein phosphatase-1; protein biogenesis; AAA ATPase; VCP/p97; ubiquitin; protein unfolding;,"RAW spectra were submitted to an Andromeda (Cox et al. 2011) search in MaxQuant (1.5.3.30) using the default settings.(Cox et al. 2008) Label-free quantification and match-between-runs was activated (Cox et al. 2014).

We specifically measured the ALK interactome, phosphoproteome, phosphotyrosine interactome and proteome as outlined below. ALK Interactome and phosphoproteome: For each experiment, three SILAC conditions (‘Light’: Lys0,Arg0, ‘Medium’: Lys4,Arg6, ‘Heavy’: Lys8,Arg10) of NB1 cells were treated for 30 minutes with each of the following ALK-targeting small-molecule inhibitors: TAE684 (100 nM), crizotinib (500 nM), and LDK378 (250 nM).  The experiments were performed as specified below:  Experiment 1: Light: 500 nM crizotinib, Medium: 100 nM TAE684, Heavy: 0.1% DMSO Experiment 2: Light: 100 nM TAE684, Medium: 250 nM LDK378, Heavy: 0.1% DMSO Experiment 3: Light: 250 nM LDK378, Medium: 500 nM crizotinib, Heavy: 0.1% DMSO These three triple-SILAC experiments allowed the effect of each inhibitor to be measured in duplicates. ALK phosphotyrosine interactome: To identify phosphotyrosine-specific interaction partners of ALK we used a label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach. Interacting proteins to the peptide sequences (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptide) indicated in the table below were identified by a peptide pull-down assay and mass spectrometry.

Concordantly, we found that Lztr1+/- mice showed craniofacial abnormalities, cardio defects, and premature ageing; whereas loss of LZTR1 in Schwann cells drives their dedifferentiation into proliferating, pro-myelinating cells. We screened for LZTR1 substrates by trapping LZTR1 complexes from intact mammalian cells. In parallel, we analysed changes in the ubiquitin landscape induced by LZTR1 loss of function. RAS proteins emerged as substrates of the LZTR1/CUL3 complex, which inhibits the RAS pathway by ubiquitinating RAS at K170 and triggering its dissociation from the membrane. Disease-associated LZTR1 mutations affect either the LZTR1/CUL3 complex formation, or the interaction with RAS proteins.

Despite their teratogenicity, thalidomide and related IMiD drugs are now a mainstay of cancer treatment, however, the molecular basis underlying the pleiotropic biology and characteristic birth defects remains unknown. Here we show that IMiDs disrupt a broad transcriptional network through induced degradation of several C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, including SALL4, a member of the Spalt-like family of developmental transcription factors. Strikingly, heterozygous loss of function mutations in SALL4 result in a human developmental condition that phenocopies thalidomide induced birth defects such as absence of thumbs, phocomelia, defects in ear and eye development, and congenital heart disease. We find that thalidomide induces degradation of SALL4 exclusively in humans, primates and rabbits, but not in rodents or fish, providing a mechanistic link for the species-specific pathogenesis of thalidomide syndrome.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","IMiDs, thalidomide, ubiquitin, cullin, crl4","Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher) was used for .RAW file processing and controlling peptide and protein level false discovery rates, assembling proteins from peptides, and protein quantification from peptides.

At a cellular level, this life and death decision is controlled by environmental stimuli including death receptors activation. Here, we show that establishment of cell polarity and AJ formation control the pro-apoptotic signaling emanating from the death receptor Fas. We demonstrate that in colon epithelia Fas concentrates at cell-cell junctions together with the E-cadherin, which protects cells from FasL-induced cell death. The Fas-cadherin association requires the C terminal PDZ binding site of Fas and, using a proteomic approach, we showed that this domain allows the association with the polarity molecule Dlg1. We proved that the interaction of Fas with this scaffold molecule participate to this cell death protection. Therefore inhibition of FasL-induced cell death by Fas-cadherin-Dlg1 complex is a double-edged sword mechanism that helps to maintain epithelial homeostasis by (i) protecting normal polarized epithelia from apoptosis (ii) promoting the elimination of compromised non-polarized cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""TIC""]","Human, LC-MSMS, PDZ, cell Polarity, epithelia, cell death, death receptor","Protein identification and quantification.

First, the RIA data for at least 3 time-points were considered necessary for determination of the labelling trajectory. As the protein content of the secretome increases with time, we only analysed peptides where we had RIA data at both 6 h and 24 h post exchange of DMEM. We only focussed on peptides that had been identified and quantified, allowing RIA calculation, at > 1 time-point in the labelling trajectory, too, so that we were effectively tracking their RIA behaviour over time. Peptides for which we obtained evidence at a single time-point, were rejected, even if they yielded informative RIA data for the kinetic behaviour of the parent protein in the system). Peptides were also rejected from further analysis if they showed impossible behaviour in this experimental system, for example, their calculated RIA 30 min after media exchange was > that after 24 h.

First we compared biopsies from 10 patients collected at the time of diagnoses (untreated CD) with biopsies collected 1 year later following gluten free diet (treated CD). We observed overall good agreement between differential expression of proteins and histological changes that occur in the intestine. We identified biological pathways that are known to operate in the disease lesion. We also observed a strong signal for neutrophil infiltration. By use of a dedicated immunoglobulin variable gene family database we found that differential expression of IGHV5-51 distinguished our untreated from treated CD patients. We also compared protein expression in 4 treated CD patients that developed histological changes in the small intestine in response to a 3 day gluten challenge. Although these patients develop an intestinal lesion resembling the lesion observed in untreated patients, we observed differential expression of proteins involved in acute tissue remodeling that were not seen when we compared UCD to TCD samples.

PXD009174,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009174,Integrated proteomic analysis of Tumor Necrosis Factor α and Interleukin 1 β-induced endothelial inflammation,"Objective The vascular endothelium provides a unique interaction plane for plasma proteins and leukocytes in inflammation. It has been established that particular proteins, including ICAM1, VCAM1 and SELE, are upregulated on the endothelial cell surface in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) and Interleukin 1β (IL-1β). We now map cytokine-induced proteomic alterations to gain further insight into endothelial inflammation.  Approach and results We evaluated alterations in the in-depth proteome, cell surface proteome and phosphoproteome after 24 hours of cytokine stimulation. In addition, protein expression profiles were measured after 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours of stimulation. We found that cytokine-stimulation induced a two-step response. After 4 hours, initial protein alterations were detected, including upregulation of ICAM1 and SELE, followed by a second burst of regulation after 8 to 16 hours, which included proteins involved in antigen processing, cytokine production, virus defense and ECM-interaction. Furthermore, we found that TNFα and IL-1β provoke a highly similar endothelial response with few specific alterations. Using a novel cell surface proteomics approach, we observed highly similar changes on the cell surface. Two surface proteins displayed altered labeling of specific epitopes, suggesting that these sites are modified or involved in interactions. Combined,  our integrated proteomic data describes a full array of affected processes: leukocyte interaction, self-antigen presentation, cytokine production, nitric oxide production and extracellular matrix interaction.  Conclusions Our study provides a detailed quantitative proteomic analysis of endothelial inflammation in which novel inflammation-responsive proteins were uncovered, and a two-step cytokine response was identified.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""biotinylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""6""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion ETD""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","Endothelium, inflammation, TNFα, IL-1β, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, cell surface proteomics, time-resolved","Proteome data processing and analysis Raw files were analyzed with the MaxQuant (1.5.3.8) computational platform29.

Relative quantification was based on SILAC (Arg0Lys0, Arg6Lys4 and Arg10Lys8) using unique peptides for quantification only and enabling the ‘re-quantify’ and ‘match between runs’ options. For the cell surface peptidome the addition of a biotin group (339.16166 Da) was used as a variable modification and for the phosphoproteome ‘Phospho (STY)’ was used as a variable modification. Two subsequent pull-downs of biotin- and phosphopeptides of the same sample were treated as fractions of the same sample. MaxQuant output tables were loaded and analyzed using Rstudio 1.0.44 using R version 3.3.2.30. In brief, ‘reverse’, ‘potential contaminant’, ‘only identified by site’ and peptides quantified in less than 3 replicates in 1 condition were filtered out. For phosphoproteomic analysis only class I phosphopeptides31 were selected (localization probability >0.75, score difference >5). For cell surface peptidome analysis biotinylated peptides were filtered according to the same criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear model without intercept and applying contrasts for each comparison in cases with multiple comparisons.

Here, we report system-wide identification of serine ADPr in human cells upon oxidative stress. High-resolution mass spectrometry and unrestricted data processing confirm that serine residues are the major target of ADPr in HeLa cells. Proteome-wide analysis identifies 3,090 serine ADPr sites, with 97% of acceptor sites modulating more than 2-fold upon oxidative stress, while treatment with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib abrogates this induction. Serine ADPr predominantly targets nuclear proteins, while structural-predictive analyses reveal that serine ADPr preferentially targets disordered protein regions. The identified ADP-ribosylated serines significantly overlap with known phosphorylated serines, and large-scale phosphoproteomics analysis provides evidence for the site-specific crosstalk between serine ADPr and phosphorylation. Collectively, we demonstrate that serine ADPr is a widespread modification and a major nuclear signaling response to oxidative stress, with a regulatory scope comparable to other extensive posttranslational modifications - Part 1, ADP-ribosylation data.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""HeLa cell""]","[{""ptm"":""adenosine diphosphoribosyl (ADP-ribosyl) modified residue"",""UNIMOD"":""41""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","ADP-ribosylation, serine, ADP, ribosylation, HeLa, ETD, unrestricted, LUMOS","For the main search, all RAW files were analyzed using the freely available MaxQuant software (version 1.5.3.30).

For data dependent analysis, the library of 4783 SOMAmer®s were multiplexed in sets of 8 and used for enrichment of target proteins from cell lysate and conditioned media, as well as human plasma and serum.  A subset of the SOMAmer®s were screened in urine by this global profiling technique as well.  Cell lines were selected from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia for screening by comparing gene expression of the target proteins measured by RNA sequencing across the CCLE.1  Using the criterion of FPKM value greater than 5 for the target protein, the minimum number of cell lines was grown to maximize protein coverage across the SOMAmer® library.  For a given cell line, the presence of at least 8 target proteins with FPKM values greater than 5was required for inclusion.  Approximately 400 target proteins were not covered by this strategy were screened in serum and plasma only.  For enrichment from biological matrices, SOMAmer®s were combined into sets of 8 such that the potential interaction with similar proteins or binding partners was minimized.  Non-specific binding of the SOMAmer®s was assessed in each matrix by using a SOMAmer® generated against the bacterial protein CysH.  Target protein spectral counts in the SOMAmer® enriched samples were compared to the respective CysH control.  A positive hit is defined as target protein detection with a minimum of 2 spectral counts and signal over CysH background greater than 10X (if applicable).","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood serum""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos"",""Q Exactive""]","[""Technical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Blood serum, blood plasma, cell lysate, conditioned media, aptamer, SOMAmer","The data were searched using Uniprot Human canonical database (v Jan 2014) with common contaminants and reverse database appended (43136 sequences; 23452844 residues).

Dysregulation of the secretion pattern of obesity-associated enlarged WAT may lead to obesity-related disorders. This dysregulation may be the result of a hypoxic state caused by poorly vascularised WAT. The effect of hypoxia on the secretome of human (pre)adipocytes is largely unkown. Therefore, secretome changes of CoCl2-treated and non-treated human SGBS (pre)adipocytes were studied by using 2DE with bioinformatic analysis. In addition, regulation of protein secretion was analysed by protein turnover experiments. Hypoxia-induced secretome changes were mostly associated with protein down-regulation and extracellular matrix protein dysregulation. The observed up-regulation of collagens in adipocytes may be essential for cell survival while down-regulation of collagens in preadipocytes may indicate a disturbed differentiation process. These hypoxia-induced changes can be seen as WAT dysfunction that may lead to obesity-associated complications. In addition, 9 novel adipocyte secreted proteins were identified from which 6 were regulated by hypoxia.LC ESI-MS/MS and database search: Excised spots were in-gel trypsin digested and ten microliters of the digested was analyzed by LC ESI-MS/MS on a LCQ Classic (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). The trapped sample was separated on the analytical column (Biosphere C18, 5 µm particle diameter, 200 mm L × 0.05 mm i.d.; Nanoseparations, Nieuwkoop, The Netherlands) using a linear gradient from 5 to 60% (v/v) ACN in water containing 100 mM acetic acid in 55 min (100 nL/min). The eluate of the analytical column was nanosprayed from a Teﬂon connected, gold-coated fused silica emitter (5 µm i.d.; NanoSeparations). With respect to LC-ESI-MS/MS, LCQ Xcalibur v2.0 SR2 raw ﬁles and spectra were selected from Proteome Discover1.2 software (Thermo Scientiﬁc) with the following settings: minimal peak count 50; total intensity threshold 4000; and S/N = 6. Peak lists were searched with Sequest v1.2.0.208 and Mascot v2.3.0.1 against EMBL-EBI International Protein Index database for human proteins (version 3.78, 86 702 entries) and using following settings: fragment tolerance, 1.00 Da (monoisotopic); parent tolerance, 3.0 Da (monoisotopic); ﬁxed modiﬁcations, carbamidomethylation of cystein; variable modiﬁcations, oxidation of methionin; max missed cleavages, 2. Search engine results were combined and validated by Scaffold v3.00.07 (Proteome Software, Portland, OR) with minimum peptide and protein probability set to =80%, followed by visual inspection of spectral (annotation) quality and manual curation, eliminating high background spectra and single engine identiﬁcations, evaluating one-hit wonders and ﬁltering out keratins. Mass spectrometry data can be visualized using PRIDE Inspector and Scaffold .sf3 free viewer (https://proteomecommons.org/tool.jsp?i=1009). Maldi-MS and database search: For MALDI-TOF MS 1.5 mL of each peptide mixture and 0.5 mL matrix solution (10 mg/mL CHCA in 50% ACN/0.1% TFA) was spotted automatically onto a 96 well-format target plate. The spots were allowed to air-dry for homogeneous crystallization. Spectra were obtained using a M@LDI-LR mass spectrometer (Waters). The instrument was operated in positive reflector mode. The acquisition mass range was 900–3000 Da. The instrument was calibrated on 6–8 reference masses from a tryptic digest of alcohol dehydrogenase. In addition, a near point lockmass correction for each sample spot was performed using adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18–39 (MH1 2465.199) to achieve maximum mass accuracy. Typically 100 shots were combined and the background was subtracted. A peptide mass list was generated for the subsequent database search. For semi-quantitative labeling measurements, the area of the M15 peak was divided by that of the M peak x100%. A SD was obtained for this isotopomer mass peak ratio by repeating the experiment three times. Significance of differences between ratios was determined by analysis of variance. The peptide mass list was searched with ProteinLynx Global Server (Waters) or the Mascot search engine (http://www.matrixscience.com) against the Swiss-Prot database (http://expasy.ch/sprot) for protein identification. One miss-cleavage was tolerated, carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as an optional modification. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 100 ppm.

However, it has not been investigated if and how cellular transformation and oncogenic stress alters telomeric chromatin composition and function. Here we transform human fibroblasts by consecutive transduction with vectors expressing hTERT, the SV40 early region and activated H-RasV12. Pairwise comparisons of the telomeric proteome during different stages of transformation reveals upregulation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair and replication at chromosome ends. Depletion of several of these proteins induces telomere fragility indicating their roles in replication of telomeric DNA. Depletion of SAMHD1, which has reported roles in DNA resection and homology directed repair, leads to telomere breakage events in cells deprived of the shelterin component TRF1. Thus our analysis identifies factors, which accumulate at telomeres during cellular transformation to promote telomere replication and repair, resisting oncogene-borne telomere replication stress.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","Quantitative proteomics, replication stress, SAMHD1, telomeres, transformation","Mass spectrometry analysis and data processing.

The rapid progression of the disease urgently calls for both a broader and deeper understanding of its pathophysiology. In line with this statement, the Human Diabetes Proteome Project (HDPP) was officially launched at the 11th HUPO meeting in Boston, 2012. A special session was dedicated to this new initiative, gathering experts in the main topics related to diabetes and its associated complications. Key issues were debated with a focus on how deranged circulating glucose and free fatty acids induce dysfunction. It has been decided that HDPP will therefore focus on studying the early stages of diabetes that lead to abnormal glucose and lipid levels. The initiative will initially focused on islets of Langerhans, insulin-producing cell lines, and blood human samples from diabetes-related cohorts. In subsequent stages HDPP will investigate target tissues in which glucose and lipids could promote protein dysfunctions. Omics-rooted systems approaches enhanced by bioinformatics will be deployed to unravel effects of lipids and glucose triggering diabetes initiation and progression. A first milestone has been defined for the 12th HUPO meeting in Yokohama, 2013: the 1000 diabetes-associated protein (the 1000-HDPP) database, i.e. a freely available internet resource (www.HDPP.info) of more than 1000 proteins with links to their corresponding proteotypic peptides, affinity reagents and protein-specific biological/biomedical information.

Amino acid limitation that inactivates mTORC1 promotes de-phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a key transcriptional regulator of lysosome biogenesis and autophagy that is deregulated in cancer and neurodegeneration. Beyond its cytoplasmic sequestration, how TFEB phosphorylation regulates its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, and whether TFEB can coordinate amino acid supply with glucose availability is poorly understood. Here we show that TFEB phosphorylation on S142 primes for GSK3 phosphorylation on S138, and that phosphorylation of both sites but not either alone activates a previously unrecognised nuclear export signal (NES). Importantly, GSK3 is inactivated by AKT in response to mTORC2 signalling triggered by glucose limitation. Remarkably therefore, the TFEB NES integrates carbon (glucose) and nitrogen (amino acid) availability by controlling TFEB flux through a nuclear import-export cycle.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","TFEB, Nuclear Export Signal, GSK3, mTOR, Glucose Lysosome biogenesis Running header: TFEB nuclear export","LC-MS/MS data was analysed using PEAKS Server V.7 (Bioinformatics Solutions) and a Uniprot/Trembl database.

The selected p-value was set at 0.05. In DAVID, we used the Functional Annotation Clustering tool to identify proteins in the most important biological functional groups. In DAVID, a significant enrichment score for a group indicates that the proteins are involved in a cluster that may have a significant function in a given dataset. The parameters for clustering were those that refer to medium classification stringency (EASE enrichment threshold: 1.0). Clusters were ranked according a Group Enrichment Score, which is calculated by considering the geometric mean of member's pvalues in a corresponding annotation cluster.  Differentially expressed proteins were imported into IPA for the identification of the canonical pathways. This analysis identified the pathways from the IPA canonical pathway library that were present exclusively in naïve or primed secretomes.

PXD008562,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008562,Displacement Chromatography Mode – High protein sequence coverages and identification rates for low µg-range proteomics using online 2D-LC-MS,"In bottom-up proteomics, the complexity of proteomes is still a challenge. For deep proteome profiling, multi-dimensional separation strategies and large initial protein amounts are required. Here, we report on an online 2D-LC-MS/MS approach applying strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) in displacement chromatography mode (DCM) as the first dimension of separation. This method enables a comprehensive analysis of proteomes in the low µg-range (5 µg). The first detailed comparison of DCM with conventionally used gradient chromatography mode (GCM) highlights a significantly better separation efficiency with DCM. Especially for peptides with a net-charge state (NCS) of +2, which represents the majority of tryptic peptides in mammalian proteomes, DCM provides a significantly better separation. These peptides were separated over several fractions in DCM, which is not possible to achieve in GCM due to theirs low affinity towards the SCX column. The better separation in DCM results not only in a considerably higher reproducibility (Pearson’s r=0.93), but significantly increases identification rates of both peptides and proteins. For peptides with a low NCS, DCM achieved a 2.6-fold increase in identified peptides. In total, DCM provides a 1.5-fold increase in peptide identifications and a 1.7-fold increase of protein identifications. The number of identified unique peptides per protein and the protein sequence coverages were significantly higher in DCM compared to GCM providing more reliable quantitative results. The higher sequence coverage are of interest for applications such as proteogenomics, where it is important to have high protein sequence coverages to identify single amino acid variants and splice-junction peptides.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion""]","[""Technical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","displacement chromatography, online 2D-LC-MS, proteomics","LC-MS raw data were processed with MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8).

PXD008824,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008824,Identification of non-overlapping functions between adaptor proteins NCK1 and NCK2,"Signals from cell surface receptors are often relayed via adaptor proteins. NCK1 and NCK2 are Src-Homology (SH) 2 and 3 domain adaptors that regulate processes requiring a remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton. Evidence from gene inactivation in mouse suggest that NCK1 and NCK2 are functionally redundant, although recent reports support the idea of unique functions for NCK1 and NCK2. We sought to examine this question further by delineating NCK1- and NCK2-specific signalling networks. We used both affinity purification-mass spectrometry and BioID proximity labelling to identify NCK1/2 signalling networks comprised of 98 proteins. Strikingly, we found 30 proteins restricted to NCK1 and 28 proteins specifically associated with NCK2, thus suggesting differences in their function. We report that Nck2-/-, but not Nck1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are multi-nucleated and display extended protrusions reminiscent of intercellular bridges, which correlate with an extended time spent in cytokinesis as well as a failure of a significant proportion of cells to complete abscission. Our data also show that the midbody of NCK2-deficient cells is not only increased in length, but also altered in composition, as judged by the mislocalization of AURKB, PLK1 and ECT2. Finally, we show that NCK2 function during cytokinesis requires its SH2 domain. Taken together, our data delineate the first high-confidence interactome for NCK1/2 adaptors and highlight a number of proteins specifically associated with either protein. We further demonstrate that contrary to what is generally accepted, NCK1 and NCK2 are not completely redundant, and shed light on a previously uncharacterized function for the NCK2 adaptor protein in cell division.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""kidney""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""LTQ Orbitrap"",""TripleTOF 5600""]","[""Biological""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]",,"Mass spectrometry, Specificity, NCK adaptors","We used data from three independent AP-MS experiments including a 3xFLAG-GFP line as a negative control to performe a significance analysis using SAINT to focus on high-confidence interactions as described elsewhere.

However, several limitations have been noted, including sample loss during filtration, repetitive centrifugation steps, and the possibility of breakage of filtration membrane. Extraction bias among different sample preparation strategies is another challenging question. To overcome these limitations and address remaining challenges, we developed a novel surfactant and chaotropic agent assisted sequential extraction/on pellet digestion (SCAD) protocol.  The new strategy resulted in higher protein yield, improved peptide recovery and protein coverage compared to two conventional sample preparation methods (FASP and urea). In combination of three strategies, more than 10,000 distinct protein groups were identified with 1% FDR from MDA-MB-231 cells without any pre-fractionation. This in-depth proteome analysis was accomplished by optimization of protein extraction, enzymatic digestion, LC gradient and peptide sequencing method. IPA analysis of protein exclusively identified in SCAD revealed several crucial signaling pathways which regulate breast cancer progression. An unbiased extraction of different categories of proteins associated with tumorigenesis was also demonstrated. This novel strategy not only expedites comprehensive protein identification but also post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins (e.g., glycosylation), thus is applicable for biomarker discovery in various types of cancers.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Technical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","Protein extraction, protein digestion, protein detection, SCAD, FASP, Urea, peptide sequencing, LFQ, iBAQ","Data analysis Proteome Discoverer 2.1 and MaxQuant were used to perform peptide identification and quantification.

The list of proteins identified (reported in section S3 of the supporting information) was used to create a protein database (“histone&contaminants database”) against which extensive searches (allowing up to 15 PTMs) were performed (using both, Prosight PC and Informed Proteomics).  Table 1 lists proteins identified using Prosight PC 4.0 for searches against the confined database allowing for a maximum of 13 modifications and applying UVPD fragmentation settings for top-down MS2 (RAW files were processed using the Xtract algorithm). The analysis was performed in Absolute mass mode with mass tolerance of 10 ppm for precursor and 10 ppm for fragments using the Δm mode (this function allows to identify proteoforms with PTMs not included in the annotated proteoform database). The unmatched spectra were further searched in Biomarker discovery mode, using the same mass tolerance settings. Histone identifications were filtered using the best hit per experiment function and a P<1E-04 cut-off. Analysis of a single dataset with this approach took 2 days on a personal computer with Intel Core i7-3820 CPU processor at 3.6 GHz with 32 GB of RAM. Additionally, we searched all datasets against the “histone&contaminants database” using the Informed-Proteomics workflow29: ProMex for intact mass deconvolution, MSPath-Finder as search engine, and LcMsSpectator as a data visualization tool. The feature maps reported in various figures were obtained using LcMsSpectator. The results reported in Table 2 were generated from ProsightPC using absolute mass searches against the complete human proteome, with mass tolerance of 10 ppm for precursor and 10 ppm for fragments, allowing up to 13 PTMs and filtered using P<1E-04 cut-off and according to C score results",2018-03-01,"[[""DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00458"",""PMID:30226781""]]"
PXD009500,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009500,Bi-directional cell-pericellular matrix interactions direct stem cell fate,"Modifiable hydrogels have revealed tremendous insight into how physical characteristics of cells’ 3D environment drive stem cell lineage specification. However, in native tissues, cells do not passively receive signals from their niche. Instead they actively probe and modify their pericellular space to suit their needs, yet the dynamics of cells’ reciprocal interactions with their pericellular matrix when encapsulated within hydrogels remains relatively unexplored. Here, we show that human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSC) encapsulated within hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels modify their pericellular environment through degradation and/or protein secretion, imparting them with similar pericellular stiffnesses, regardless of initial hydrogel properties. These cell-secreted pericellular matrices play a role in regulating hMSC fate, with secretion of a stiff proteinaceous pericellular matrix associated with adipogenesis, and degradation with osteogenesis. Our observations suggest that hMSC participate in a bi-directional interplay between the properties of their 3D milieu and their own secreted pericellular matrix, and that this combination of interactions drives fate.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]","[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]","[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biological""]","[""Gel-based experiment""]","[""SILAC""]","stem cells, matrix proteins, interactions, fate, Lumos, orbitrap, SILAC","Acquired raw data were analyzed with MaxQuant software (version 1.3.0.5).

Although deregulation of K8 phosphorylation has been associated with progression of different carcinomas, its role in skin SCC and the underlying mechanism is obscured. To understand the molecular basis of K8 phosphorylation mediated regulation of skin SCC progression, we performed TMT-based quantitative phosphoproteomics by expressing K8 wild type, phosphodead and phosphomimetic mutants in K8 deficient A431 cells. Bioinformatic analysis of our phosphoproteomic data showed differential regulation of phosphoproteins associated with migratory, proliferative and invasive potential in these cells.

The peptidome presented by HLA-B*51:08 in a cell line expressing Hap10 was compared with the HLA-B*51:01 peptidome from a cell line expressing higher activity variants of ERAP1. The differences due to ERAP1 could be clearly distinguished from those due to subtype polymorphism. The latter should not affect disease susceptibility, since both HLA-B*51 subtypes are associated with BD. In the lower activity, BD-associated, ERAP1 context longer peptides were generated, the Pro2 subpeptidome was significantly reduced, and the Ala2 subpeptidome was correspondingly increased and showed a higher frequency of ERAP1-susceptible P1 residues. These effects are readily explained by the low activity of the disease-associated Hap10 variant, and together resulted in a significantly altered HLA-B*51 peptidome of lower affinity. The differences between both B*51 subtypes affected residue usage at various internal positions of the peptide ligands, including P3, where B*51:01 showed preference for aromatic residues whereas B*51:08 preferred smaller and polar ones.

Until now, research mainly focused on differences in core ribosomal proteins and associated factors. The impact of posttranslational modifications has not yet been studied systematically. Analyzing ribosome heterogeneity is challenging since individual proteins can be part of different subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S and polysomes). Here, we develop polysome proteome profiling (3P) to obtain unbiased proteomic maps across ribosomal subcomplexes. 3P combines extensive fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation with quantitative mass spectrometry. The high resolution of the profiles allows us to assign proteins to specific subcomplexes. Phosphoproteomics on 3P fractions reveals that phosphorylation of serine 38 in RPL12 -- a known mitotic CDK1 substrate -- is strongly depleted in polysomes. Follow-up experiments confirm that RPL12 phosphorylation regulates translation of specific subsets of mRNAs during mitosis. Together, our results show that posttranslational modification of ribosomal proteins can regulate translation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""phosphorylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""21""},{""ptm"":""deamidated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""7""},{""ptm"":""acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""1""}]","[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Ribosome, LC-MS","All raw data were analyzed and processed by MaxQuant (v1.5.1.2) (Cox and Mann 2008).

How cells recover from a DNA damage-induced arrest is currently poorly understood. We have performed large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify changes in protein phosphorylation that occur during recovery from a G2 arrest. We identified 154 proteins that were differentially phosphorylated in multiple experiments. Systematic depletion of each of these differentially phosphorylated proteins by siRNA identified at least 10 potential regulators of recovery. Data processing and bioinformatics: Raw data were converted to single DTA files using DTA SuperCharge and merged into Mascot Generic Format (MGF) files, which were searched using an in-house licensed Mascot v2.2 search engine against Human Swissprot 56.2 database concatenated with reversed sequences as decoy (containing 40656 sequences, 20328 forward sequences).  Carbamidomethyl cysteine and oxidized methionines were set as fixed modifications; serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylations were set as variable modifications; quantification was set with dimethyl double mode. The mass tolerance of the precursor ion was 10 ppm and 0.9 Da for fragment ions. The false discovery rate (FDR) was determined as < 1% (Mascot score threshold of 31) using the decoy database approach and the MGF files were trimmed at Mascot score threshold of 31 (1% FDR) by RockerBox.

Erroneous charge state and monoisotopic m/z values were corrected as per previous publication 22. MS/MS spectra assignments were made with the Sequest algorithm 3  using indexed Ensembl databases (Mouse: Mus_musculus NCBIM37.61, Human: Homo_sapiens GRCh37.61). Databases were prepared with forward and reversed sequences concatenated according to the target-decoy strategy 41.  All searches were performed using a static modification for cysteine alkylation (57.02146 Da).   Closed Searches.  Closed searches were performed with Sequest (Rev28) using indexed databases with a precursor ion tolerance of 5 ppm.  The fragment ion tolerance was set very narrow (0.01 Da).  Specificity was set based on the protease used (trypsin for HEK293 studies and Lys-C for mouse studies) and allowing 1 missed cleavage.  Oxidized methionine was considered dynamically (+15.994915 Da).  Sequest matches were filtered by linear discriminant analysis as described previously 22  to a dataset level error of 1% FDR at the protein level (~0.2% peptide level) based on matches to reversed sequences 41.  Open Searches.  Open searches were performed with Sequest exactly as for Closed searches with the following changes.  The precursor ion tolerance was set to 500 Da unless otherwise specified.  The GUI (graphical user interface) in Proteome Discoverer 2.0 (soon to be released) will allow Open searches to be conducted.  Oxidized methionine was not considered as a dynamic modification.  Post-search filtering via linear discriminant analysis did not use mass accuracy (ppm) as a feature for differentiating true and false positives.  These searches often considered more than 1000 fold greater peptide search spaces.  However, the time penalty for this increase does not scale linearly for Sequest and was ~10 fold.  Open searches for each 3-hr analysis considered on average 44,390 MS/MS spectra and finished in less than two hours on a standard 6-core CPU with 6MB RAM.  Note that using the pre-indexed database option is essential to achieving reasonable search times.   Guassian fit analysis Mass shifts were clustered using Gaussian mixture models using the mclust package for R Core 52-54. Mass shifts were binned in to 1 Da windows bounded at each half Da point. Within each bin, the number of mass shifts annotated in UniMod 55  falling within that bin were used to set the maximum number of Gaussian mixtures in the model, and the mixture models allowing for variable mixture variances were fitted within that window. An optimal number of mixture components was calculated by the software using BIC, and the model for that number of components was used. Fitted mixture components with a variance greater than 0.01 were then removed from the data set.  Ascore The Ascore algorithm 40  uses the cumulative binomial probability distribution to provide a localization score for a mass difference (phosphorylation, +79.9663) to a serine, threonine, or tyrosine.  We modified the Ascore algorithm to allow for the localization of any modification mass to any potential site within the peptide.  Because sufficient information was not always present to localize to a specific site, scores were calculated for individual sites as well as regions.  An Ascore value of >20 (p<0.01) was used as a threshold significance value for assigning modifications to an amino acid or region within a peptide. Supplementary table 2 contains the Ascore, Ascore sequence (potential location of modification), Ascore region (amino acids in which the score is identical) and the number of amino acids considered in the region. In addition, a modification could not be localized if the number of ions matched for a peptide does not increase when the modification is considered throughout the sequence.",2014-11-06,"[[""DOI:10.1038/nbt.3267"",""PMID:26076430""]]"

Here we develop stringent experimental and computational workflow, capable of mapping more than 50,000 distinct phosphorylated peptides in a single human cancer cell line. Label-free quantitation determined very high stoichiometries in mitosis or growth factor signaling and more than three-quarters of cellular proteins were detected as phosphoproteins. The proportion of phospho-Tyr drastically decreases as coverage of the phosphoproteome increases, whereas Ser/Thr sites only saturate for technical reasons. Tyrosine phosphorylation is maintained at especially low stoichiometric levels in the absence of specific signaling events. Unexpectedly, it is statistically enriched on higher abundance proteins and this correlates with the substrate Km values of tyrosine kinases.

However, due to technical difficulties involved in their assembly and analysis, the role of repeats in tumor evolution is poorly understood. We developed a rigorous motif-based methodology to quantify variations in the repeat content of proteomes and genomes, directly from proteomic and genomic raw sequence data, and applied it to analyze a wide range of tumors and normal tissues. We identify high similarity between the repeat-instability in tumors and their patient-matched normal tissues, but also tumor-specific signatures, both in protein expression and in the genome, that strongly correlate with cancer progression and robustly predict the tumorigenic state. In a patient, the hierarchy of genomic repeat instability signatures accurately reconstructs tumor evolution, with primary tumors differentiated from metastases. We find an inverse relationship between repeat-instability and point mutation load, within and across patients, and independently of other somatic aberrations. Thus, repeat-instability is a distinct, transient and compensatory adaptive mechanism in tumor evolution.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""ovary""]",,"[""Q Exactive HF""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","Repeat-instability, tumor evolution, proteomic signatures,","Raw MS files were analyzed in the MaxQuant software (version 1.5.6.9 ) and Andromeda search engine .

Here, we identify a homozygous truncation mutation in the UBQLN4 gene in families with highly pleiotropic autosomal recessive syndrome, with clinical and cellular characteristics reminiscent of DNA repair disorders. UBQLN4 loss leads to hypersensitivity to genotoxic stress and delayed repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). By dissecting the molecular mechanism of action, we find an ATM-dependent phosphorylation site on UBQLN4 (Ser-318), which is required for the cellular protection against DNA damage and proper DSB repair. UBQLN4 is a known proteasomal shuttle factor for ubiquitinated proteins and we demonstrate that loss of UBQLN4 leads to the accumulation and retention of MRE11 and RPA70 at DSB sites. Concomitantly, we find that UBQLN4 loss of function is associated with a relative increase in homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair and a reduced usage of non-homologous end joining. In contrast, UBQLN4 overexpression represses HRR usage. We show that this UBQLN4-driven preference for NHEJ-mediated DSB repair is conserved in C. elegans. Moreover, a detailed analysis of human neuroblastoma and melanoma cancer samples reveals that UBQLN4 is overexpressed in aggressive tumors. In line with a HRR defect, we observe that tumor cells overexpressing UBQLN4 display an actionable PARP1 inhibitor sensitivity.

Endosomes undergo a process of maturation which specifies whether material will be shuttled back to the cell surface or degraded by the lysosome. Nevertheless, a complete inventory of factors regulating endosomal maturation is still lacking. Recently, membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endosomes have emerged as important players in endosomal sorting, dynamics and motility. Here, we identify the ER transmembrane protein PDZD8 as a new Rab7 effector that, together with the MCS component Protrudin, forms an ER-late endosome MCS.

Blood plasma was collected  from schizophrenia patients six weeks after treatment (T6), and patients were  classified as good or poor responders to olanzapine or risperidone, and then  samples were compared to each patient's baseline (T0).

Comparing peptides artificially mixed at low heavy-to-light stoichiometry measured using standard data dependent acquisition with or without TMD revealed 2-3 fold increases in identification without significant loss in quantification precision for both MS2 and MS3 methods.

Assessing the specificity of anntibodies, or any protein binder, is essential for the development of a protein biomarker assay. In addition to antibodies, novel protein binders like affimers are developed with a high specificity against the target protein and without batch-to-batch variability. In this study, we compared the specificity of affimers and commercially available antibodies against two non-related proteins (IL-37 and proinsulin).   We conducted protein capture experiments with antibodies coupled to magnetic protein G beads and (biotinylated) affimers coupled to streptavidin magnetic beads. Binding capacity of anti-IL-37 and anti-proinsulin antibodies and affimers was investigated via these magnetic-bead captures of their recombinant protein targets in human plasma.   The purified fractions were transferred to an SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel digestion of the visualized protein bands and subsequently analyzed with western blot or shotgun proteomics using LC-MS/MS.

However, these approaches do not have a direct effect on the protein product of the gene, which is either permanently abrogated or depleted at a rate defined by the half-life of the protein. Therefore, complete gene deletions and RNA interference of proteins with a very long half-life risk obscuring the direct consequences via compensatory or secondary cellular responses. We therefore sought to develop a single-component system that could induce the rapid degradation of the specific endogenous protein itself. A genetically introduced inducible construct of the RING domain of the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 with a protein-specific camelid nanobody mediates destruction of the target by the ubiquitin proteasome system, a process we describe as Antibody RING-Mediated Destruction (ARMeD). The technique is acutely specific as we observed no off-target protein destruction. Furthermore, bacterially produced nanobody-RING fusion proteins electroporated into cells induce degradation of target within minutes. With the increasing availability of protein-specific nanobodies this method will allow the rapid and specific degradation of a wide range of endogenous proteins.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""Q Exactive""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics"",""Gel-based experiment""]","[""SILAC""]",RING Ubiquitin Nanobody Endogenous Degradation,"The 66 raw MS data files were processed using MaxQuant software (version 1.6.1.0) (Cox and Mann, 2008), and searched against UniProtKB human proteome (canonical and isoform sequences; downloaded in April 2019), plus a fasta file containing the sequence of the induced RING-NEDP1-nanobody construct.

Using mRNA sequencing, bioinformatics analyses and RT-qPCR validation, we identified differential IR and altered expression of key genes involved in macrophage development and function, both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that decreased IR in nuclear-detained mRNA is coupled to increased expression of genes encoding regulators of macrophage transcription, phagocytosis and inflammatory signalling, including ID2, IRF7, ENG and LAT. We further show that this dynamic IR program persists during the polarisation of resting macrophages into activated macrophages. In the presence of proinflammatory stimuli, intron-retaining CXCL2 and NFKBIZ transcripts in macrophages are rapidly spliced, leading to timely expression of these key inflammatory regulators by macrophages.

This process does not depend on the presence of accessible or useable DNA in a sample. This makes proteomic genotyping an attractive alternative for analysis of problematic forensic samples, such as hair shafts, degraded bones or teeth, fingermarks, or sexual assault evidence. To demonstrate the concept in hair shafts, we developed an optimized sample processing protocol that could be used with high effectiveness on single hairs. This allows us to determine if the detected profiles of genetically variant peptides are robust and result in a consistent profile of inferred SNP alleles regardless of the chemical or biological history of the sample.  Several real world scenarios have been evaluated. Here we include a study of four European subjects that had both pigmented and non-pigmented (or gray and non-gray) hair shafts. We tested whether (a) protein profiles change as a result of the loss of pigmentation and (b) these changes were reflected in the inferred genotype derived from detection of genetically variant peptides.

While significant efforts have been invested in analyzing the HLA peptidomes of fresh tumors, it is often impossible to obtain sufficient volumes of tumor tissues for comprehensive HLA peptidome characterization. This work attempted to overcome some of these obstacles by using patient-derived xenograft tumors (PDX) in mice as the tissue sources for HLA peptidome analysis. PDX tumor provide a proxy for expansion of the patient tumor by re-grafting them through several passages to immune compromised mice. The HLA peptidomes of human biopsies were compared to those derived from PDX tumors. Larger HLA peptidomes were obtained from the significantly larger PDX tumors as compared to the patient biopsies. The HLA peptidomes of different PDX tumors derived from the same source tumor biopsy were very reproducible, even following subsequent passages to new naïve mice. A large number of CTA-derived HLA peptides were discovered, as well as several neoantigens. Taken together, use of PDX tumors for HLA peptidome analysis serves as a highly expandable and stable source of reproducible and authentic peptidomes, opening up new opportunities for defining large HLA peptidomes when only small tumor biopsies are available.

Structural and functional brain alterations are reflected in the protein composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) patients have higher CSF levels of tau, but we lack knowledge of systems-wide changes of CSF protein levels that accompany AD. Here we present a highly reproducible mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics workflow for the in-depth analysis of CSF from minimal sample amounts. From three independent studies (>200 individuals), we characterize differences in proteins by AD status (>1,000 proteins, CV<20%). Proteins with previous links to neurodegeneration such as tau, SOD1 and PARK7 differed most strongly by AD status, providing strong positive controls for our approach. CSF proteome changes in Alzheimerâ€™s disease prove to be widespread and often correlated with tau concentrations.

PXD016618,https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD016618,O-glycan initiation directs distinct biological pathways and controls epithelial differentiation,"Glycosylation is an abundant post-translational modification of both intracellular and extracellular proteins [1]. The majority of glycans are classified as N-linked chains, where the carbohydrate moiety is attached to asparagine residues, or O-linked chains, most commonly linked to a serine or threonine. N-linked glycosylation is initiated by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex with only two paralogs of the catalytic subunit, whereas O-glycan initiation is more complex. There are several types of O-linked glycosylation, but among the most diverse is the mucin or GalNAc type (hereafter referred to as O-glycosylation). O-glycosylation is initiated by 20 evolutionarily conserved polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (GalNAc-Ts), which catalyze the first step in the O-glycosylation of proteins by adding GalNAc residues to threonine, serine, and tyrosine amino acids (Fig 1A). Each of the GalNAc-Ts are differentially expressed in various tissues and have both distinct and overlapping peptide substrate specificities [2-12]. Thus, the repertoire of GalNAc-Ts expressed in a given cell determines the subset and O-glycosite pattern of glycosylated proteins [13]. Substantial efforts have been made to characterize and predict the substrate specificities of GalNAc-Ts in vitro, but understanding of the in vivo specificities of the individual GalNAc-Ts or their biological functions is limited [13-15]. This lack of insight prevents an understanding of how site-specific O-linked glycosylation affects diseases, such as metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and various malignancies, that have been associated with GalNAc-Ts through genome-wide association studies and other linkage studies [16-26]. Therefore, it is imperative that we establish how O-glycosylation at specific sites in proteins affects protein function. A major task in achieving this goal is to identify the non-redundant biological functions of site-specific O-glycosylation.  We and others recently developed new strategies for identifying specific sites on proteins that undergo O-glycosylation in different cell types and tissues [27-31]. Characterization of the O-glycoproteomic landscape in isolated human cells and multiple human cell lines suggests that more than 80 % of all proteins that traffic through the secretory pathway are O-glycoproteins [28, 30]. Probing the non-redundant contributions of individual GalNAc-Ts in cells with and without specific GalNAc-Ts [32-34] has revealed broad substrate specificities for some of the individual isoforms, whereas others seem to have very restricted substrate specificities [33-35]. Assessing all of the mapped O-glycosylation sites to identify associations between O-glycosites and protein annotations, we recently found that O-glycans are over-represented close to tandem repeat regions, protease cleavage sites, within propeptides, and on a select group of protein domains [28, 30, 36]. Although such general associations between the location of O-glycans and protein functions may direct future investigations, the strategy does not define the function of site-specific glycosylation. Further progress in discovering and defining novel functions of site-specific glycosylation events requires direct quantitative analysis of potential biological responses induced by the loss of distinct GalNAc-T isoforms, and such biological responses are not easily observed in single cell culture systems. Instead, more complex model systems can be used to examine and dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the important biological functions of site-specific glycosylation. We previously used an organotypic tissue model equipped with genetically engineered cells to decipher the function of elongated O-glycans [29]. In the present study, we use the model combined with quantitative O-glycoproteomics and phosphoproteomics to perform open-ended discovery of the biological functions of site-specific glycosylation governed by GalNAc-Ts (Fig 1B). With this combinatorial strategy, we demonstrate that loss of individual GalNAc-T isoforms has distinct phenotypic consequences through their effect on distinct biological pathways, suggesting specific roles during epithelial formation.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos"",""Orbitrap Fusion""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"3D skin, differential glycoproteomics, polyomics, polypeptide GalNAc-transferase, tissue development","Bioinformatics analysis Bioinformatics analysis was performed as described previously [32].

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomics is a rapid and highly sensitive approach for high-throughput identification of phosphorylation sites. However, the exact localization of phosphorylation sites which depends on trypsin-centric shotgun phosphoproteomics is often arbitrary and unreliable because of the limited product ion coverage in the MS2 spectra. Therefore, phosphorylation site determination from MS data with a single protease cannot be expected to be comprehensive, regardless of the strategy used for phosphopeptide detection. Here, we have explored the application of LysargiNase which was recently reported to mirror trypsin in specificity to cleave arginine and lysine residues exclusively at the N-terminal side. Our data demonstrates that the combined application of LysargiNase and trypsin results in higher sequence coverage with more complete ladder sequences which is helpful to pinpoint the precise phosphorylation sites. Therefore, the combined use of these two enzymes will partially overcome the limitations of trypsin-centric phosphoproteomics to achieve a more reliable phosphoproteome and to increase the identification of novel phosphorylation sites.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""liver""]",,"[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"LysargiNase, phosphoproteome, phosphosite localization","MS/MS raw files were searched in Proteome Discoverer 2.0 (version 2.1.21, Matrix Science Mascot) against the neXtProt database (version 201506).

Cells lacking Cyclin B can enter mitosis and phosphorylate most mitotic proteins, because of parallel PP2A:B55 phosphatase inactivation by Greatwall kinase. The final barrier to mitotic establishment corresponds to nuclear envelope breakdown that requires a decisive shift in the balance of Cdk1 and PP2A:B55 activity. Beyond this point Cyclin B/Cdk1 is essential to phosphorylate a distinct subset mitotic Cdk1 substrates that are essential to complete cell division.

On the global scenario, PKDL in mainly restricted to distinct zones of South Asia (India, Nepal and Bangladesh) and East Africa, mainly Sudan. In India, the most prominent fatal form of leishmaniasis present is VL, affecting entirely the eastern region of the country. The clinical presentation of VL and PKDL differ substantially; where VL patients suffer from sustained fever, hepatospleenomegaly, weight loss and anemia, PKDL patients manifest dermal lesions in the form of macular, nodular and polymorphic.  Although, compared to VL, the mortality rate of PKDL is significantly lower, yet it is observed as a stigmatizing disease that brings a substantial socioeconomic burden, further intensified by a hesitancy of patients, to obtain treatment, or due to noncompliance. Lesions, especially the polymorphic forms, are parasite-rich, concluding that PKDL plays a crucial role in the anthroponotic transmission of VL. PKDL patients with Macular lesions, having comparatively lower parasitic load, and thus lacks detection sensitivity with standard techniques like rK39 (73% sensitivity), Leishmanin skin test (54% sensitivity) and Histopathological studies with patients’ skin biopsy sample (7-33% sensitivity) and is often misdiagnosed as Vitiligo cases. In order to completely eliminate Kala-azar in Southeast Asia, proper identification of various routes of the disease is essential, which could efficiently distinguish between cured PKDL and active PKDL as well as active PKDL from other cross disease like Leprosy and Vitiligo. Till now very less work has been done towards biomarker identification for PKDL from patients’ plasma. Most of the methods for disease identification are based on highly invasive tissue biopsy followed by PCR/qPCR. Recently investigations from our group have demonstrated the presence of novel glycoproteins in the circulating immune complexes (CICs) from serum, as biomarkers for early identification of PKDL patients. An Immune complex (IC), sometimes called an antigen-antibody complex, is a molecule formed from the integral binding of an antibody to a soluble antigen. After an antigen-antibody reaction, the immune complexes can be subject to any number of responses, including complement deposition, opsonisation, phagocytosis, or processing by proteases. Accumulation of ICs leads to a broad spectrum of pro-inflammatory effects, including activation of the complement cascade and induction of cytokine secretion. These complexes may also be deposited in tissues and vessel walls, leading to inflammation, tissue damage and, ultimately, disease manifestations. Immune complexes also affect disease progression and outcome in various disorders through the induction of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines. In the present study we hypothesize that the CICs’ proteome is altered among PKDL patients with different dermal manifestations (Macular and Polymorphic) as compared to Cured individuals (CR) and Healthy controls (HI). The aim of this current study is to identify differentially expressed CIC proteomic profile among different forms PKDL patients as compared to HI. The differential protein expression of specific unique peptide fragments, representing specific proteins, could be used as diagnostic biomarkers in early detection of both Macular and Polymorphic PKDL cases. In this prospective study, we included PKDL patients with Macular and/or Polymorphic lesion, Cured individuals and HI. Among the enrolled patients, blood samples were collected from 20 primarily confirmed PKDL patients with Macular lesions, 20 primarily confirmed PKDL patients with Polymorphic lesions, 12 Cured individuals previously suffering from PKDL and 12 Healthy individuals; collected during the period of 2015-2016, stored at -80°C. Next the CICs were purified from PKDL patients’ plasma and LC MS/MS analysis was performed using Q-ExactivePlusOrbitrap mass spectrometer. This work for the first time revealed the differential CICs proteome profile among different forms of PKDL patients as compared to their Cured and Healthy counterparts.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood plasma""]",,"[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"",""Human Proteome Project""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","Post Kala Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis, Circulating immune complexes, biomarker, Healthy (P1), Macular (P2), Polymorphic (P3), Cured (P4), Proteomics",The raw data acquired were converted into a single “.mgf” format file containing the peaklist by Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using default parameter.

However, the downstream signal transduction pathways involved are poorly characterised. Here a quantitative differential phosphoproteomics approach, SILAC, is applied to identify FGF-regulated phosphorylation events in two triple- negative breast tumour cell lines, MFM223 and SUM52PE, that exhibit amplified expression of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) and are dependent on continued FGFR2 signalling for cell viability. Comparative Gene Ontology proteome analysis revealed that SUM52PE cells were enriched in proteins associated with cell metabolism and MFM223 cells enriched in proteins associated with cell adhesion and migration. FGFR2 inhibition by SU5402 impacts a significant fraction of the observed phosphoproteome of these cells. This study expands the known landscape of FGF signalling and identifies many new targets for functional investigation. FGF signalling pathways are found to be flexible in architecture as both shared, and divergent, responses to inhibition of FGFR2 kinase activity in the canonical RAF/MAPK/ERK/RSK and PI3K/AKT/PDK/mTOR/S6K pathways are identified. Inhibition of phosphorylation-dependent negative-feedback pathways is observed, defining mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to FGFR2 inhibition.

Dissecting the mechanisms, regulation and consequences of NECMs, such as glycation, has been challenging due to the complex and often ambiguous nature of the adducts formed. Directly tracking the formation of modifications on key targets to uncover their underlying physiological importance requires specific chemical tools. Here we present the novel chemoenzymatic syntheses of an active azido-modified ribose analog, 5-azidoribose (5-AR), as well as an inactive control derivative, 1-azidoribose (1-AR) and their application towards understanding protein ribose-glycation in vitro and in cellulo. With these new probes we found that, similar to MGO-glycation, ribose glycation specifically accumulates on histones. In addition to fluorescent labeling, we demonstrate the utility of the probe in enriching modified targets, which were identified by label-free quantitative proteomics and highresolution MS/MS workflows. Finally, we establish that the known oncoprotein and hexose deglycase, fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K), recognizes and facilitates the removal of 5-AR glycation adducts in live cells, supporting the dynamic regulation of ribose glycation as well as validating the probe as a new chemical tool to monitor FN3K activity.

The proliferation, differentiation, and cell death of epidermal progenitor cells have to be delicately regulated, as deregulation of this process can lead to many skin diseases, including skin cancers. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in skin homeostasis remain poorly defined. In this study, with quantitative proteomics approach, we identified an important interaction between KDF1 (Keratinocyte Differentiation Factor 1) and IKKα (IκB kinase α) in differentiating skin keratinocytes. Ablation of either KDF1 or IKKα in mice leads to similar but striking abnormalities in skin development, particularly in skin epidermal differentiation. With biochemical and mouse genetics approach, we further demonstrate that the interaction of IKKα and KDF1 is essential for epidermal differentiation. To probe deeper into the mechanisms, we find that KDF1 associates with a deubiquitinating protease, USP7 (Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 7), and KDF1 can regulate skin differentiation through deubiquitination and stabilization of IKKα.

Remarkably, we find that CSTB (but not one of its pathological variants) is secreted into the mouse cerebral spinal fluid and the conditioned media from hCOs. In embryonic mouse brain, we find that functional CSTB influence progenitors’ proliferation and simultaneously modulate neuronal distribution by attracting interneurons to the site of secretion via cell non-autonomous mechanisms. Similarly, in patient-derived hCOs, low levels of functional CSTB result in an alteration of progenitor’s proliferation, premature differentiation, and changes in interneurons migration.

During the recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV), myalgia was one of the most frequently reported symptoms. We investigated the susceptibility of human muscle cells to ZIKV infection. Using an in vitro model of human primary myoblasts that can be differentiated into myotubes, we found that myoblasts can be productively infected by ZIKV. In contrast, myotubes were shown to be resistant to ZIKV infection, suggesting a differentiation-dependent susceptibility. Infection was accompanied by a caspase-independent cytopathic effect, associated with paraptosis-like cytoplasmic vacuolization. Proteomic profiling was performed 24h and 48h post-infection in cells infected with two different isolates. Proteome changes indicate that ZIKV infection induces an upregulation of proteins involved in the activation of the Interferon type I pathway, and a downregulation of protein synthesis. This work constitutes the first observation of primary human muscle cells susceptibility to ZIKV infection, and differentiation-dependent restriction of infection from myoblasts to myotubes.

They have therefore been set aside and considered as differentially abundant proteins. Next, missing values were imputed using the imp.norm function of the R package norm. Proteins with a log2 (fold-change) inferior to 1 have been considered as proteins which are not significantly differentially abundant. Statistical testing of the remaining proteins (having a log2 (fold-change) superior to 1) was conducted using a limma t-test70 thanks to the R package limma71. An adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to the resulting p-values thanks to the function adjust.p of R package cp4p72 using a robust method73 to estimate the proportion of true null hypotheses among the set of statistical tests. The proteins associated to an adjusted p-value inferior to an FDR level of 1% have been considered as significantly differentially abundant proteins. Finally, the proteins of interest are therefore those which emerge from this statistical analysis supplemented by those which are considered to be absent from one condition and present in another. Statistical enrichment tests were used to highlight major biological processes that may be affected during the infection, using DAVID software35 by selecting the set of quantified proteins among all replicates as background. Biological processes related to up/down-regulated proteins in each condition have been compared to those of up/down-regulated proteins in non-infected samples. If not specified, statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests were used to test the differences between groups.

PXD015880,https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD015880,Exploring the impact of PARK2 mutations on the total and mitochondrial proteome of human skin         fibroblasts,"Mutations in PARK2 gene are the most frequent cause of familial forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). This gene encodes Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in several cellular mechanisms, such as the mitophagic process. Mutations in this gene, which cause the loss of function of Parkin, are responsible for the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. This improper disposal may generate increased levels of ROS, lower ATP production and apoptosis activation. Given the importance of mitochondrial dysfunctions and mitophagy impairment in PD pathogenesis, the aim of the present project was to investigate both whole-cell and mitochondrial proteome alterations in human skin fibroblasts of PARK2-mutated patients. To this purpose, total and mitochondrial-enriched protein fractions from fibroblasts of five PARK2-mutated patients and five control subjects were analyzed by quantitative shotgun proteomics, in order to identify proteins specifically altered by Parkin loss. Both the network-based and the GSEA analysis of proteomics results pointed out the importance of pathways in which Rab GTPase proteins are involved. An alteration of their levels also in the mitochondrial fraction may indicate a re-localization of these GTP/GDP molecular switches, master regulators of membrane trafficking. To have a more comprehensive view of the mitochondrial alterations due to PARK2 mutations, we investigated the impact of Parkin loss on mitochondrial function and network morphology. We unveiled that the mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced in PARK2-mutated patients. Nevertheless, PINK1 did not accumulate on depolarized mitochondria. Even after the treatment with CCCP, an ionophore that triggers mitophagy, the accumulation of PINK1 was less efficient in PARK2-mutated patients than in controls derived fibroblasts. The analysis of the mitochondrial network morphology showed a filamentous network with mitochondria distributed all over the cell that was comparable between PARK2-mutated patients and control subjects. Thus, our results suggested that the network morphology was not influenced by the mitochondrial depolarization and by the lack of Parkin, revealing a possible impairment of fission and, more in general, of mitochondrial dynamics. In conclusion, the present work highlighted new molecular factors and pathways altered by PARK2 mutations. Furthermore, we obtained a definition of the mitochondrial landscape and molecular mechanisms underlying the PARK2 form of Parkinson’s disease, which will help to unravel possible biochemical pathways altered also in the sporadic form of the disease. Indeed, it is known that in sporadic cases the genetic/epigenetic background and the environment lead over time to mitochondria impairment and to the accumulation of damaged organelles.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""skin""]",,"[""Synapt MS""]","[""Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"",""Human Proteome Project"",""Mitochondria (HPP)""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""APEX - Absolute Protein Expression""]","PARK2 mutation, mitochondria, mass spectrometry, human skin fibroblast, shotgun proteomics, immunoprecipitation, Parkinson’s Disease","Separated peptides were analyzed in a shotgun experiment on a Synapt G2-Si Mass spectrometer (Waters Corp), directly coupled to the chromatographic system, with data-independent acquisition (DIA) by High Definition Mode (HDMSe).

Although MDSCs were initially described as bone-marrow-derived immature myeloid cells (either monocytic [m-MDSC] or granulocytic [g-MDSC]), also mature neutrophils have been shown to exert MDSC activity towards T cells, in ways that so far remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that human neutrophils – both from healthy donors and cancer patients – do not exert MDSC activity unless they are activated. Using neutrophils with genetically well-defined defects, we found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and granule-derived constituents are required for MDSC activity after direct CD11b-dependent neutrophil-T cell interactions. Besides these cellular interactions, neutrophils were engaged in the uptake of pieces of T cell membrane, a process called trogocytosis. Together, these interactions led to changes in T cell morphology, mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion, as indicated by electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and metabolic parameters. Our studies characterize the different steps by which activated mature neutrophils induce functional T cell non-responsiveness and irreparable cell damage.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""primary cell""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion ETD""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","MDSC, small T cells, large T cells","The RAW mass spectrometry files were processed with the MaxQuant computational platform, 1.5.3.30.

PXD011961,https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD011961,Shifts in Ribosome Engagement Impact Key Gene Sets in Neurodevelopment and Rett Syndrome Neurons,"Translation of many transcripts is highly regulated in the developing brain, and disturbance of translational regulation machinery contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders. In neural progenitor cells, for example, several critical pro-differentiation genes are transcribed, but their translation is repressed to allow rapid translation when appropriate signals to differentiate are received. This layer of translational regulation makes it challenging to directly correlate RNA and protein levels in stem cells and neurons. During early neural development, translation is regulated by several pathways that can impact neuron fate and function. The mTOR-mediated signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the induction of neuron differentiation, axon and dendrite development, and gliogenesis, while being key in the maintenance of pluripotent and neural stem cells {Wang:2013hg}{Agrawal:2014ek}{Ka:2014fq}. Dysregulation of the translation repressor eIF4E-binding protein 2 (4EBP2), a downstream target of mTORC1,   leads to an increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviors {Gkogkas:2013fh}. The Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which is encoded by the FMR1 gene {Verkerk:1991hu}, is an RNA binding protein (RBP) that regulates translation through multiple mechanisms {Richter:2015ii}. Loss of expression of FMR1 causes Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited intellectual disability as well as the most prevalent single-gene cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FMRP typically functions as a translational repressor {Li:2001ds} and some studies suggest that FXS results from an inability of neurons to achieve regulated local translation, particularly in response to stimuli {Richter:2015ii}.

To date, knowledge on neuronal development is largely based on murine data and largely restricted to the genomic and transcriptomic level. Advances in stem cell differentiation now enable the study of human neuronal development, and here we provide a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic signature, at high temporal resolution, of human stem cell-derived neurons. To reveal proteomic changes during neuronal development we make use of two different differentiation approaches, leading to glutamatergic induced neurons (iN) or small molecule-derived patterned motor neurons. Our analysis revealed key proteins that show significant expression changes (FDR <0.001) during neuronal differentiation. We overlay our proteomics data with available transcriptomic data during neuronal differentiation and show distinct, datatype-specific, signatures.

The UPR plays a key role in a variety of disorders (including diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory processes) and has been implicated in cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy. However, the mechanisms and pathways by which the UPR contributes to chemoresistance are only poorly understood. We have employed a multi-omics approach to monitor changes to gene expression after induction of the UPR with two different compounds, probing in parallel the transcriptome, the proteome, and changes to translation. Stringent filtering reveals the induction of 267 genes (the UPR regulon), many of which have not previously been implicated in stress response pathways. We experimentally demonstrate that UPR-mediated translational control via phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2a) and subsequent induction of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) causes an up-regulation of enzymes involved in a pathway that diverts intermediate metabolites from glycolysis to fuel mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism.

As proteomics can identify, quantify, and characterize proteins in different conditions, it is a powerful tool to study complex diseases such as schizophrenia, also capable of revealing potential biomarkers. To improve treatment efficacy during the early stages of schizophrenia, a critical time period, molecular markers for a positive treatment response were sought. Blood plasma samples were collected in vivo from 26 patients before treatment with the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone; they were then classified as good (GR) and poor (PR) responders.

However, those methods had never been compared in samples from the same tumor and patient. In this work, we compared the two most used methods, elution and centrifugation, in pieces of the same biopsy samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). First, we established that high G-force (10000g) was required to obtain TIF from cSCC by centrifugation. Secondly, we compared the centrifugation method with the elution method in pieces of three different cSCC tumors. We found that the mean protein intensities based in the number of peptide spectrum matches was significantly higher in the centrifuged samples than in the eluted samples. Regarding the robustness of the methods, we observed higher overlapping between both methods (77-80%) than among samples (50%). These results suggest that exists an elevated consistence of TIF composition independently of the method used. However, we observed a three-fold increase of extracellular proteins in non-overlapped proteome obtained by centrifugation.

As MWCNT are produced in large quantities, occupational exposure and human health is of particular concern. However, there is no consensus regarding their potential harmful effects. In particular, chronic exposure to MWCNT and mechanisms of their action at protein and lipid levels are unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate effects of long-term chronic exposure to MWCNT on cellular proteome and lipidome. Since the lung is the major target organ, an in vitro normal bronchial epithelial cell model was used. To better mimic exposure at occupational settings, cells were chronically exposed for 13 weeks to low-doses of MWCNT. MWCNT-treatment increased ROS levels in cells without increasing DNA damage and resulted in differential expression of multiple apoptotic proteins. A shotgun proteomic and lipidomic analysis of the MWCNT-exposed cells showed that of amongst the >5000 identified protein s,groups; more than 200 were altered in treated cells.  Functional analysis revealed association of these differentially regulated proteins in various cellular processes such as cell death and survival, cellular assembly and organization. Similarly, the lipid profile of the MWCNT treated cells showed accumulation of multiple lipid classes.

Here we aimed to identify specific protein markers that could serve as specific molecular targets in either phenotype. A set of total 45 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) endometrial tumor tissue and adjacent myometrial tissue samples were analyzed using LC-MS/MS in SWATH-MS mode. We found that calcyphosin (CAPS) levels were elevated in EN tumors compared to ET tumors. The higher CAPS level in EC tissue invading to myometrium support its relationship to EC aggressiveness. Further, stathmin (STMN1) levels were found significantly elevated in ET vs. EN tumors and significantly associated with patient survival. This finding connects elevated levels of this cell cycle regulating, proliferation-associated protein with tamoxifen exposure. In a summary, using SWATH-MS we show that CAPS and STMN1 should be recognized as clinicopathologically different EC markers of which STMN1 is specifically connected with a previous tamoxifen exposition.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""uterine endometrium""]",,"[""TripleTOF 5600""]",,"[""SWATH MS""]","[""SWATH MS""]","endometrial cancer, SWATH-MS, FFPE, calcyphosin, stathmin","Database search for spectral library generation The spectra were searched using the search engines X!

Spectral counts and peptides for ProteinProphet were filtered at FDR of 0.009747 mayu-protFDR (=0.794757 iprob).  SWATH-MS data analysis The data was analyzed using a pipeline configured on the iPortal platform in the Aebersold lab at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. The raw SWATH wiff files were converted using ProteoWizard to profile mzXML files (PMID: 18606607). The extraction of the data was performed using the OpenSWATH workflow (PMID: 24727770). An m/z fragment ion extraction window of 0.05 Th and an RT extraction window of ±5 min were used. The best models to separate true from false positives (per run) were determined by pyProphet with 10 cross-validations. The runs were subsequently aligned with a target FDR of 0.01 for aligned features (PMID: 27479329). Background signals were extracted for features that could not be confidently identified (PMID: 27479329). The data was then processed using the R 3.4/Bioconductor package SWATH2Stats (PMID: 27054327). Precursors had to pass an m-score threshold of 0.0004 in at least of 20% of the 45 files to be selected for further analysis. This threshold resulted in an estimated protein FDR of 0.01 (using an estimated fraction of false targets or π0-value of 0.12 for estimating the FDR).",2020-02-04,

Fibroblast-like cells are abundant in tumor stroma and they are also responsible for the synthesis of many extracellular matrix components. Fibroblast–cancer cell interplay can modify the functions of both cell types.   We applied mass spectrometry and proteomics to unveil the matrisome in 3D spheroids formed by DU145 prostate cancer cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells or prostate derived fibroblasts. Similarly DU145/fibroblast and PC3/fibroblast co-culture spheroids were also analyzed. Western Blotting and immunofluorescence were used to confirm the presence of specific proteins in spheroids. Cancer dissemination was studied by utilizing ""out of spheroids"" migration and invasion assays.  In the spheroid model cancer cell–fibroblast interplay caused remarkable changes in extracellular matrix and accelerated the invasion of DU145 cells. Fibroblasts produced structural matrix proteins, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases. In cancer cell/fibroblast co-cultures basement membrane components, including laminins (3, 5, 2, 3), heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG2 gene product), and collagen XVIII accumulated in a prominent manner when compared to spheroids that contained fibroblasts or cancer cells only. Furthermore, collagen XVIII was intensively processed to different endostatin isoforms by cancer cell derived cathepsin L.  To sum up, fibroblasts can promote carcinoma cell dissemination by several different mechanisms. Extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins provide attachment sites for cell locomotion promoting adhesion receptors. Growth factors and metalloproteinases are known to accelerate cell invasion. Additionally, cancer cell–fibroblast interplay generates biologically active fragments of basement membrane proteins, such as endostatin.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,,"[""Q Exactive""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","matrix proteins, matrisome, fibroblasts, DU145, PC3, basement membrane proteins","Tandem mass spectra were searched using the MaxQuant (with a built-in Andromeda search engine) software (version 1.5.2.8) against a database containing reviewed human (SwissProt) and unreviewed (TrEMBL) sequences, including different isoforms, of UniProtKB release 2017_12.

The roles of p38IP in immunoreceptor signaling remain unclear. Here, we show that p38IP suppresses T cell receptor (TCR)/LPS-activated NF-κB and p38 by targeting TAK1 kinase and that p38IP protein levels are downregulated in human-PBMCs from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, inversely correlating with the enhanced activity of NF-κB and p38. Mechanistically, p38IP interacts with TAK1 to disassemble the TAK1-TAB (TAK1-binding protein) complex. p38IP overexpression decreases TCR-induced binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains to TAK1 but increases that to TAB2, and p38IP knockdown shows the opposite effects, indicating unanchored K63-linked polyUb chain transfer from TAB2 to TAK1. p38IP dynamically interacts with TAK1 upon stimulation, because of the higher binding affinity of TAK1 and p38IP for sequential polyUb binding by TAB2 and TAK1, respectively. Moreover, p38IP specifically scaffolds the deubiquitinase USP4 to deubiquitinate TAK1 once TAK1 is activated. These findings reveal a novel role and the mechanisms of p38IP in controlling TCR/LPS signaling and suggest that p38IP might participate in RA pathogenesis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]",,"[""Gel-based experiment""]",,"human, Jurkat T cells, TAK1","For information dependent acquisition, survey scans acquired in 250 ms and 20 product ion scans were collected in 50 ms per scan.

The molecular events underpinning transcriptional elongation and processivity and CDK-Cyclins involved remain poorly understood. Using CRISPR-CAS9 homology-directed-repair we generated analog-sensitive-kinase variants of CDK12 and CDK13 to probe their individual and shared biological and molecular roles. Single inhibition of CDK12 or CDK13 induced transcriptional responses associated with DNA-damage and cellular growth signaling pathways respectively, with minimal effects on cell viability. In contrast, dual-kinase inhibition potently induced cell death, which was associated with extensive genome-wide transcriptional changes including wide-spread use of alternative 3’ polyadenylation sites. At the molecular level dual-kinase inhibition resulted in the loss of POLII CTD phosphorylation and greatly reduced POLII elongation rates and processivity.

Sequestration of mRNAs by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) into stress granules (SGs) reduces translation, but it remains unclear whether SGs also function in partitioning of specific transcripts to polysomes (PSs) to guide selective translation and stress-adaptation in cancer. Transcripts enriched in PSs, defined by polysome fractionation and RNAseq, were compared with mRNAs complexed with the SG-nucleator protein, G3BP1, defined by spatially-restricted enzymatic tagging. Short-term oxidative stress profoundly altered mRNA translation by promoting selective enrichment of transcripts within SGs or PSs. G3BP1 participates in this compartmentalisation by sequestering transcripts in SGs. Under stress, G3BP1-bound transcripts are PS-depleted and encode proteins involved in mRNA translation, pro-apoptosis, and mitochondrial function. In contrast, specific PS-enriched transcripts disassociate from G3BP1 under stress to encode proteins involved in diverse cellular cytoprotective pathways. Therefore, G3BP1 partitioning guides selective translation to support stress adaptation and cell survival.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,,"[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]",,"[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","G3BP1, APEX, Prostate cancer, Stress granules",Data analysis was carried out using Proteome Discoverer™ Software - Thermo Fisher Scientific.,2019-09-18,"[[""PMID:32406909"",""DOI:10.1093/nar/gkaa376""]]"

Endothelial mechanosensors perceive and translate mechanical signals via cellular signaling pathways into biological processes that control endothelial development, phenotype and function. Here, we aim to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial mechanosensing. Approach and results We applied a quantitative mass spectrometry approach combined with cell surface chemical footprinting to assess the hemodynamic effects on the endothelium on a system-wide level. These studies revealed that of the >5000 quantified proteins 104 were altered, which were highly enriched for extracellular matrix proteins and proteins involved in cell-matrix adhesion. Cell surface proteomics furthermore indicated that LAMA4 was proteolytically processed upon flow-exposure, which corresponded to the decreased LAMA4 mass observed on immunoblot. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies highlighted that the endothelial basement membrane was drastically remodeled upon flow exposure. We observed a network-like pattern of LAMA4 and LAMA5, which corresponded to the localization of laminin-adhesion molecules ITGA6 and ITGB4. Furthermore, the adaptation to flow-exposure did not affect the inflammatory response to tumor necrosis factor α, indicating that inflammation and flow trigger fundamentally distinct endothelial signaling pathways with limited reciprocity and synergy. Conclusions Taken together, this study uncovers the blood flow-induced remodeling of the basement membrane and stresses the importance of the subendothelial basement membrane in vascular homeostasis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,,"[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"",""Orbitrap Fusion""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method"",""SILAC""]","Endothelium, flow, shear stress, proteomics, extracellular matrix, basement membrane, integrin, laminin, TNFα, inflammation","Raw files were processed in the Maxquant 1.5.3.30 computational platform28 to identify proteins and peptides by querying the uniprot database (release 3-2017, 70947 entries).

Inhibition of PARP activity by olaparib can cause cell death which is of clinical relevance in some tumor types. This demonstrates that quantification of PARP activity in the context of living cells is of great importance. In this work we present the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of photo-activatable affinity probes inspired by the olaparib molecule which are equipped with a diazirine for covalent attachment upon activation by UV light and a ligation handle for the addition of a reporter group of choice.

Here we describe that CD2 co-stimulation plays a critical role in the functioning of human cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). We found that CD2 promotes the formation of functional immune synapses by orchestrating the polarization of lytic granules towards the synaptic interface. To broadly explore the CD2 signaling network, we undertook an analysis of protein phosphorylation in CD2-stimulated CTLs, which revealed 549 unique CD2-regulated phosphorylation events in 373 proteins. CD2 stimulation elicited an intricated network of signaling events participating in the regulation of T cell metabolism, vesicular trafficking, autophagy, cell polarity and cytoskeleton organization. We further show that a functionally critical node of this network is the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which regulates granule polarization at the CTL synapse. Polarized trafficking of granules is driven by the concerted action of TAK1/LKB1/CamKK2 kinases, which locally activate AMPK enriched on CTL lysosome membranes, illustrating a novel functional cross-talk between vesicular compartments in CTLs. Our results thus establish CD2 signaling as key for regulating targeted granule secretion in CTLs and reveal an AMPK-dependent mechanism to explain how AMPK-activating drugs boost anti-tumour CTL activity.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free"",""TMT""]","CD2, phosphoproteome, granule secretion","LC-MS/MS was analysed in Proteome Discoverer version 2.2 (TMT-phospho data) and Progenesis QI (LFQ, surface proteomes).

We examined whether gingipains have sheddase activity or if their main activity is degradation of membrane proteins into small fragments. Using mass spectrometry, we investigated the whole sheddome/degradome of TIGK cell surface proteins by P. gingivalis strains differing in gingipain expression. We observed extensive degradation of TIGK surface proteins, suggesting that gingipains could in fact be the major cause of damage to the gingival epithelium. Most of the identified gingipain substrates were molecules involved in adhesion, suggesting that gingipains may cause tissue damage through cleavage of cell contacts, resulting in cell detachment and rounding, and consequently leading to anoikis.

However, the mechanisms underlying how COL11A1 confers cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer are poorly understood. We identified that fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) is upregulated by COL11A1 in ovarian cancer cells and that COL11A1-driven cisplatin resistance can be abrogated by inhibition of FAO. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that COL11A1 also enhances the expression of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis. Interestingly, COL11A1-induced upregulation of fatty acid synthesis and FAO is modulated by the same signaling molecules. We identified that binding of COL11A1 to its receptors, α1β1 integrin and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), activates Src-Akt-AMPK signaling to increase the expression of both fatty acid synthesis and oxidation enzymes, although DDR2 seems to be the predominant receptor. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis downregulates FAO despite the presence of COL11A1, suggesting that fatty acid synthesis might be a driver of FAO in ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that COL11A1 upregulates fatty acid metabolism in ovarian cancer cells in a DDR2-Src-Akt-AMPK dependent manner. Therefore, we propose that blocking FAO might serve as a promising therapeutic target to treat ovarian cancer, particularly cisplatin-resistant recurrent ovarian cancers which typically express high levels of COL11A1.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,,"[""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]",Proteomics; TMT; Collagen; Fatty acid oxidation; Ovarian cancer,Database searching was performed using Proteome Discoverer (v1.4) using the SEQUEST algorithm.

We and others identified tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the ascites as promoters of metastasis-associated processes like extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, tumor cell migration, adhesion and invasion. The precise mechanisms and mediators involved in these functions of TAM are, however, largely unknown. By comparing monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) differentiated in ascites to TAM-like asc-MDM, by LPS/IFN to inflammatory m1-MDM and by IL-10 to alternatively activated m2c-MDM, we found that conditioned media from both, asc-MDM and m2c-MDM, stimulated migration of patient-derived tumor cells, while m1-MDM failed to do so. Secretome analysis by mass spectrometry identified an overlapping set of 9 proteins secreted by both asc-MDM and m2c-MDM, but not by m1-MDM, in all tested donors. Of these, three proteins, namely transforming growth factor beta induced protein (TGFBI), tenascin C (TNC) and fibronectin (FN1), have been associated with migration-related functions. Intriguingly, increased ascites concentrations of TGFBI, TNC and fibronectin were associated with short progression-free survival. Furthermore, transcriptome and secretome analyses point to TAM as major producers of these proteins, further supporting an essential role for TAM in promoting HGSC progression. Consistent with this hypothesis, we were able to demonstrate that the migration-inducing potential of asc-MDM and m2c-MDM secretomes may be inhibited, at least partially, by neutralizing antibodies against TGFBI and TNC or siRNA-mediated silencing of TGFBI expression. In conclusion, the present study provides the first experimental evidence that TAM-derived TGFBI and TNC in ascites promote HGSC progression.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""ascites"",""macrophage""]",,"[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method"",""Label free""]","high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, cancer, tumor-associated macrophages, tumor microenvironment, ascites","Data were processed as described [1] using the human uniprot database (canonical and isoforms, downloaded on 02/09/2018, 183579 entries).

Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 3 patients from independent sibships from a large consanguineous family presenting with severe deafness and early-onset cataracts as part of a variable neurological, sensorial and cutaneous syndrome. Medical assessments and imaging were used to define the phenotype. Genome sequencing was performed to unravel the altered genotype by subsequent bioinformatics analysis based on a specific physiopathological filtering approach. We identified a unique homozygous variant in intron 10 of the PSMC3 gene, encoding the 26S proteasome ATPase ring subunit 5 (Rpt5), with a predicted local splice effect as a new donor site (c.1127+337A>G, p.Ser376Argfs15*) confirmed by RT-PCR. Strikingly, fibroblasts derived from patients carrying the deep intronic homozygous PSMC3 pathogenic variant exhibited strong signs of perturbed protein homeostasis, as evidenced by increased accumulation of intracellular ubiquitin-modified proteins. Most interestingly and in contrast to control cells, patient fibroblasts failed to increase their amount of proteasomes following proteasome inhibition using the TCF11/Nrf1 pathway, indicating that these cells were unable to adapt to proteotoxic stress. By way of 2 different zebrafish assays we further show that loss of function of PSMC3 leads to inner ear development anomalies as well as cataracts alike the patient phenotype.

Here we discover the extensive mixed tailing in the transcripts of two distinct DNA viruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and their striking similarity in the mechanism to exploit the TENT4-ZCCHC14 complex. TAIL-seq analyses of HBV and HCMV RNAs revealed that TENT4A and TENT4B are responsible for the mixed tailing and protection of viral poly(A) tails. By fCLIP-seq on HBV-producing cells, we found that the HBV posttranscriptional regulatory element (PRE) is the primary site of the TENT4 interactome. A hairpin with a CNGGN-type pentaloop in the PRE is critical for TENT4-dependent regulation. Unexpectedly, HCMV also utilizes a similar pentaloop hairpin, an interesting example of convergent evolution. We further found that the CNGGN pentaloop is recognized by the SAM domain-containing ZCCHC14 protein which in turn recruits TENT4 to stabilize viral transcripts. Altogether, our study reveals the action mechanism of PRE that has been widely used to enhance gene expression, and introduces the TENT4-ZCCHC14 complex as the key host factor and a potential target for antiviral therapeutics.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","RNA modification, Viral RNA, RNA-Protein Interaction","Mass spectrometric raw data files were processed with MaxQuant (version 1.5.3.30) searched using the built-in Andromeda search engine in MaxQuant against the human Uniprot database (version 12/5/2018) at default settings (20 ppm or 6 ppm of precursor ion mass tolerances for initial or main search, respectively, and 0.5 Da for fragment ion masses).

Archaeological dental calculus is a source of several different types of biomolecules, as well as microfossils, and can tell us about the human host, microbiome, diet, and even occupational activities. Here, we present a unified protocol allowing for simultaneous extraction of DNA and proteins from archaeological dental calculus. We evaluate the protocol on dental calculus from a range of ages and estimated preservation states, and compare it against standard DNA-only and protein-only protocols. We find that most aspects of downstream analyses are unaffected by the unified protocol, although minor shifts in the recovered proteome can be detected. Protein recovery depends on both the amount of starting material and choice of extraction protocol, whereas DNA recovery is significantly lowered through the unified protocol. However, DNA recovery from dental calculus is generally very high, and we found no differences in DNA fragment characteristics or taxonomic profile.

Therefore a better understanding of invadopodia biology and characteristics might permit the identification of markers of metastatic potential. Substantial efforts have been made to characterize invadopodia molecular composition, dynamics or triggering stimuli. However, the full molecular identity of these structures is still missing due to the fact that the isolation and purification of these structures has been challenging. To fill this gap, we developed a non-hypothesis driven proteomic approach based on the innovative BioID proximity biotinylation approach using the invadopodia-specific protein Tks5/FISH (its long form, Tks5) fused to the biotin ligase BirA as bait. As control, we also generated cells expressing the short form of Tks5 (Tks5) unable to localize to invadopodia. After validation of our cell models, Tks5 close neighbors were identified by label-free mass spectrometry after pulldown of biotinylated proteins. Known invadopodia components were identified revealing the pertinence of our strategy. Furthermore, this strategy allowed us to identify novel Tks5 in cellulo partners that appear as potential new invadopodia components/regulators and potential markers of metastasis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]",,"[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]",,"Tks5/SH3PXD2A, actin cytoskeleton, cancer invasion","Protein identification and quantification.

Upon the proteolytic processing of the membrane-bound protein, a circulating form of endoglin (soluble endoglin, sEng) can be released, and high levels of sEng have been observed in several endothelial-related pathological conditions, where it appears to contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder of high prevalence in pregnant women characterized by the onset of high blood pressure and often associated with increased levels of sEng. Although a pathogenic role for sEng involving hypertension has been reported in several animal models of preeclampsia, the exact molecular mechanisms implicated remain to be identified. To search for sEng-induced mediators, we have analyzed the protein secretome of human endothelial cells in the presence of sEng. We find that sEng induces the expression of BMP4 in endothelial cells, as evidenced by their proteomic signature, gene transcript levels and BMP4 promoter activity. A mouse model of preeclampsia with high sEng plasma levels (sEng+) showed increased levels of BMP4 transcripts in lungs and increased circulating BMP4, compared to those of control animals. In addition, after crossing female wild type with male sEng+ mice, hypertension appears 18 days after mating, precisely coinciding with the appearance of high plasma levels of BMP4. Also, serum levels of sEng and BMP4 are positively correlated in pregnant women with and without preeclampsia. Interestingly, sEng-induced arterial pressure elevation in sEng+ mice was abolished in the presence of the BMP4 inhibitor noggin, suggesting that BMP4 is a downstream mediator of sEng. These results provide a better understanding on the role of sEng in the pathobiology of preeclampsia and other cardiovascular diseases, where sEng levels are increased.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""iTRAQ""]","endoglin, endothelial cells, TGF-β, BMP4, hypertension, preeclampsia, HHT","The results obtained from the mass spectrometer (MS/MS peaks of each peptide) were analyzed, quantified and identified by comparison with standardized human databases using the search engine of Mascot (version 2.3, Matrix Science) and with the Proteome Discoverer software (version 1.3.0.339; Thermo Scientific).

Still, the genetic and molecular basis of many cancers remains only partially explained. Genetic predisposition accounts for 5-10% of cancer diagnoses and genetic events cooperating with known somatic driver events are poorly understood. Analyzing established cancer predisposition genes in medulloblastoma (MB), a malignant childhood brain tumor, we recently identified pathogenic germline variants that account for 5% of all MB patients. Here, by extending our previous analysis to include all protein-coding genes, we discovered and replicated rare germline loss-of-function (LoF) variants across Elongator Complex Protein 1 (ELP1) on 9q31.3 in 15% of pediatric MBSHH cases, thus implicating ELP1 as the most common MB predisposition gene and increasing genetic predisposition to 40% for pediatric MBSHH. Inheritance was verified based on parent-offspring and pedigree analysis, which identified two families with a history of pediatric MB. ELP1-associated MBs were restricted to the molecular SHH subtype and were characterized by universal biallelic inactivation of ELP1 due to somatic loss of chromosome 9q. The majority of ELP1-associated MBs exhibited co-occurring somatic PTCH1 (9q22.32) alterations, suggesting that ELP1-deficiency predisposes to tumor development in combination with constitutive activation of SHH signaling. ELP1 is an essential subunit of the evolutionary conserved Elongator complex, whose primary function is to enable efficient translational elongation through tRNAs modifications at the wobble (U34) position. Biochemical, transcriptional, and proteomic analyses revealed that ELP1-associated MBSHH are characterized by a destabilized core Elongator complex, loss of Elongator-dependent tRNA modifications, codon-dependent translational reprogramming, and induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), consistent with deregulation of protein homeostasis due to Elongator-deficiency in model systems. Our findings suggest that genetic predisposition to proteome instability is a previously underappreciated determinant in the pathogenesis of pediatric brain cancer. These results provide strong rationale for further investigating the role of protein homeostasis in other pediatric and adult cancer types and potential opportunities for novel therapeutic interference.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""medulloblastoma cell""]",,"[""Q Exactive HF-X""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""SWATH MS""]","[""Label free""]","Meduloblastoma, SHH, Elongator complex, ELP1","DDA analysis and database search The raw data were searched against the UniProt human canonical database (20211 entries, downloaded on June 21, 2016), appended with the concatenated iRT peptide sequences, using Mascot (Matrix Science, version 2.5.0) and XTandem! included in the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline software (TPP version 4.8.0 [1]).

Our data further demonstrates that the three endophilin-A isoforms control the uptake of distinct subsets of cargoes. In addition, we provide strong evidence that the construction of endocytic sites from which CD166 is taken up in an endophilin-A3-dependent manner is driven by extracellular galectin-8. Taken together, our data reveal the existence of a previously uncharacterized clathrin-independent endocytic modality, that modulates the abundance of CD166 at the cell surface, and regulates adhesive and migratory properties of cancer cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""TripleTOF 5600""]",,"[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""iTRAQ""]","HeLa, iTraq","Mass spectrometry data were analyzed with ProteinPilot Software 4.5 (AB Sciex).

While biallelic mutations of the SLC26A4 gene, encoding pendrin, causes non-syndromic hearing loss with EVA or Pendred syndrome, a considerable number of patients appear to carry mono-allelic mutation. This suggests faulty pendrin regulatory machinery results in hearing loss. Here we identify EPHA2 as another causative gene of Pendred syndrome with SLC26A4. EphA2 forms a protein complex with pendrin controlling pendrin localization, which is disrupted in some pathogenic forms of pendrin. Moreover, point mutations leading to amino acid substitution in the EPHA2 gene are identified from patients bearing mono-allelic mutation of SLC26A4. Ephrin-B2 binds to EphA2 triggering internalization with pendrin inducing EphA2 autophosphorylation weakly. The identified EphA2 mutants attenuate ephrin-B2- but not ephrin-A1-induced EphA2 internalization with pendrin.

Here, we show that human and mouse monocytes release TGF-β1-transporting vesicles in response to the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. Soluble beta-glucan from Candida albicans binds to complement receptor 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18) on monocytes and induces the release of TGF-β1-transporting vesicles. CR3-dependence is demonstrated using CR3-deficient (CD11b knockout) monocytes generated by CRISPR-CAS9 genome editing and isolated from CR3-deficient (CD11b knockout) mice. Isolated vesicles dampen the pro-inflammatory response in human M1-macrophages as well as in whole blood. Binding of the vesicle-transported TGF-β1 to the TGF-β receptor inhibits IL-1β gene transcription via the SMAD7 pathway in whole blood and induces TGF-β1 transcription in endothelial cells. Inhibition of TGF-β1 relieved the suppression of such proinflammatory effect. Notably, human opsonized apoptotic bodies induce similar TGF-β1-transporting vesicles in monocytes, suggesting that the early immune response is suppressed through this newly identified CR3-dependent anti-inflammatory vesicle pathway.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]",,"[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"monocytes, complement receptor 3, TGF-β1, mass spectrometry, extracellular vesicles","Tandem mass spectra were searched against the UniProt databases of Homo sapiens (2018/02/02; http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640) and using Proteome Discoverer (PD) 2.2 (Thermo) and the algorithms of Sequest HT (version of PD2.2) and MS Amanda 2.0, and Mascot v2.4.1 (Matrix Science, UK).

PXD016864,https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD016864,HIGD2A is required for assembly of the COX3 module of human mitochondrial complex IV,"Assembly factors play a critical role in the biogenesis of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-IV where they assist in the membrane insertion of subunits, attachment of co-factors, and stabilization of assembly intermediates. The major fraction of complexes I, III and IV are present together in large molecular structures known as respiratory chain supercomplexes. A number of assembly factors have been proposed as required for supercomplex assembly, including the hypoxia inducible gene 1 domain family member HIGD2A. Using gene-edited human cell lines and extensive steady state, translation and affinity enrichment proteomics techniques we show that loss of HIGD2A leads to defects in the de novo biogenesis of mtDNA-encoded COX3, subsequent accumulation of complex IV intermediates and turnover of COX3 partner proteins. Deletion of HIGD2A also leads to defective complex IV activity. The impact of HIGD2A loss on complex IV was not altered by growth under hypoxic conditions, consistent with its role being in basal complex IV assembly. While in the absence of HIGD2A we show that mitochondria do contain an altered supercomplex assembly, we demonstrate it to harbor a crippled complex IV lacking COX3.

The fate of a modified protein is determined by Ub-binding proteins (UBPs) that interact with Ub chains in a linkage-selective manner. Therefore, proteome-wide interaction studies using differently linked Ub chains have become a focus of research activities. However, the impact and functional consequences of chain length on the binding selectivity of UBPs remain mostly elusive, due to a lack of available tools and sufficient amounts of pure, length-defined Ub chains. Here we generated linkage- and length-defined Ub chains using click-chemistry and gel-free fractionation and employed such defined polymers in affinity-based enrichment assays to identify length- and linkage-selective interactors on a proteome-wide scale.

PXD012146,https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD012146,Functions of the 12 different isoforms of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α),"HNF4α is a nuclear receptor regulating the transcription of genes involved mainly in development, cell differentiation and metabolism. Opposite functions for the two classes of P1 and P2 isoforms of HNF4α have recently been highlighted. These classes include 12 variants of HNF4α that can be expressed by the use of two promoters and by alternative splicing. Until now, the characterization of this transcription factor has ignored this diversity and has remained confined to the study of a fraction of the isoforms. We therefore wanted to clarify the situation by specifically characterizing the transcriptional functions of the 12 isoforms of HNF4α. We have generated for this purpose stable lines expressing each isoform of HNF4α in HCT 116 cells. We analyzed the whole transcriptome associated with each isoform by sequencing RNA, as well as their proteome by a BioID approach coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry. We noted major differences in the transcriptional function of the 12 isoforms. The α4, α5 and α6 isoforms have been characterized for the first time, and show a greatly reduced transcriptional potential. We have shown that these isoforms are unable to recognize the consensus response element of HNF4α. The α1 and α2 isoforms are the most potent regulators of gene expression, while the α3 isoform exhibits significantly reduced activity. Several transcription factors and coregulators have been identified as potential specific partners for certain HFH4α isoforms. The IRF-2BP2 co-repressor interacts specifically with isoforms which include the long form of the F domain of HNF4α. This specific interaction could explain the large number of genes modulated negatively by α1 and α2 compared to α3. The analysis integrating the vast amount of transcriptomic and proteomic data allows the identification of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms specific to certain isoforms, demonstrating the importance of considering all isoforms which can have diverse functions.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture"",""colon""]",,"[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","HNF4α, colorectal cancer, nuclear receptors, transcription, proteomics, SILAC, isoforms","LC-MS/MS analysis Trypsin digested peptides were separated using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoHPLC system. 10 μl of sample (a total of 2 μg) in 1% (vol/vol) formic acid was loaded with a constant flow of 4 μl/min onto an Acclaim PepMap100 C18 column (0.3 mm id x 5 mm, Dionex Corporation).

AML is a heterogeneous disease in which molecules associated to kinase signaling are frequently mutated. However, no kinase inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of this malignancy. Thus, patient stratification requires new molecular profiling techniques in addition of to the current sequencing strategies. We have used a multiomics approach that combines proteomics, phosphoproteomics, mass cytometry and DNA sequencing to classify primary AML cells derived from 36 patients. Comprehensive integrative analysis identified molecular signatures based on phosphopeptide abundance or surface marker expression that separate AML cases according to their differentiation status. Differentiated cells presented a particular pattern of protein phosphorylation, an enrichment in the activity of several kinases and a higher sensitivity to PAK, MEK and PKC/FLT3 inhibitors. In addition, mutations in proteins closely linked to kinase signaling were more frequent on differentiated cells. Interestingly the set of patients with differentiated cells as clustered by marker expression signatures showed an increased overall survival in our set of patients and in the TCGA database registered cohort. Thus, molecular differentiation signatures could be used as prognosis and drug response markers in order to implement the application of precision medicine in AML patients.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]",,"[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"AML, Phosphoproteomics, Kinase-Inhibitors, Kinase-Signalling","Mascot Daemon 2.5.0 was used to automate peptide identification from MS data.

There are also indications of its role in cancer progression, especially in breast cancer, but the molecular mechanisms behind this and the cell cycle independent functions of MASTL are poorly understood. Regulation of cell adhesion and actin dynamics play a central role in governing cell contractility, migration and cell division in normal and cancer cells. Here, we identify MASTL as regulator of cell contractility and activator of the transcriptional co-activator MTRF-A. We show that depletion of MASTL increases cell contact with the extracellular matrix, reduces contractile actin stress fibers in normal and breast cancer cells. Importantly, depletion of MASTL also leads to strongly impairs motility of breast cancer cells. Our transcriptome and proteome profiling revealed that depletion of MASTL impairs transcription and expression of several MRTF-A target genes implicated in cellular movement and actomyosin contraction, including Rho Guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (GEF-H1, ARHGEF2) and tropomyosin 4.2 (TPM4). Mechanistically, we find that MASTL is necessary for serum-induced activation of SRF/MTRF-A transcription and that exogenous expression of GEF-H1 in MASTL depleted cells is sufficient to restore cell contractility. Taken together, our results suggest that MASTL is a previously undescribed key regulator of cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton through transcriptional control of multiple adhesion and actin cytoskeleton regulating genes with key roles in contractility, cell adhesion and migration.

Such malignancies regularly carry mutational signatures that conform to off-target induction of uracil by the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, or downstream processing of uracil.  . HDACi suppress thymidylate synthase increasing the cellular dUTP/dTTP ratio and leading to increased pressure on uracil repair machinery due to misincorporated uracil lesions. To investigate potential effect upon other enzymes involved in genomic uracil induction and processing, Jurkat (T-cell lymphoma) and SUDHL5 (B-cell lymphoma) cells were treated with pan-HDACi SAHA prior to SILAC based MS/MS investigation. HDACi treatment mediated significant differential expression of xx and xx proteins in Jurkat and SUDHL5, respectively, and had a substantial impact upon enzymes involved in in pyrimidine metabolism. Surprisingly, uracil N-glycosylase, UNG, was strongly downregulated by HDACi treatment. Further analysis in HEK and HeLa cells revealed that HDACis induce specific loss of the nuclear isoform UNG2 independent of transcription and cell-cycle alterations. More than 80% of UNG2 is degraded proteasomally after 24 hours treatment with SAHA, MS275, Valproate or Na-butyrate, indicating a universal ability of HDACis to mediate loss of UNG2.  Targeted MS/MS analysis in HEK cells against a panel of proteins involved in DNA repair, translesion synthesis and nucleotide metabolism, revealed that UNG2 was the most pronounced differentially expressed among these after HDACi treatment. 48 hour treatment lead to a 30-40% increase in uracil lesions in the nuclear genome of HeLa and HEK cells and MS275 treatment in murine CH12F3 cell line mediated robust UNG2-loss accompanied by reduced class switch recombination. Furthermore, our analysis identified the PCNA-associated factor PAF15 among the downregulated proteins. PAF15 is overexpressed in many cancers and suppress TLS by inducing double monoubiquitinylation of PCNA and recruitment of the replicative polymerases. In summary, our findings demonstrate that HDAC inhibition affects the levels of proteins involved in DNA base excision repair, translesion synthesis and pyrimidine metabolism.

Although high cure rates can be achieved at early stages, metastases, resistance to cisplatin-based therapy, and late toxicities still represent a lethal threat, arguing for the need of new therapeutic options. In a previous study, we identified downregulation of the chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF complex member ARID1A as a key event in the mode of action of the histone deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin, subsequently leading to induction of stress, apoptosis and cell cycle regulators. Additionally, ARID1A is mutated in many different tumor types, like bladder, breast or ovarial cancer. There, the loss-of-function mutations re-sensitize these tumor types to various drugs, like EZH2-, PARP-, HDAC-, HSP90- or ATR-inhibitors. Thus, ARID1A presents as a promising target for synthetic lethality and combination therapy. In this study, we deciphered the molecular function of ARID1A and screened for the potential of two pharmacological ARID1A inhibitors as a new therapeutic strategy to treat GCTs. By CRISPR/Cas9, we generated ARID1A-deficient GCT cells and demonstrate that ARID1A regulates transcription, DNA repair and the epigenetic landscape on DNA and histone level via DNA Polymerase POLE and the DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein DMAP1. Additionally, ARID1A deficiency or pharmacological inhibition considerably sensitized (cisplatin-resistant) GCT cells towards ATR inhibition.

Disulfide formation involves both an oxidative pathway for their insertion and a reductive pathway to remove incorrectly formed disulfides.  Reduction of these disulfides is critical for correct folding and degradation of misfolded proteins.  Previously, we showed that the reductive pathway is driven by NADPH generated in the cytosol.  Here, by reconstituting the pathway using purified proteins and ER microsomal membranes, we demonstrate that the thioredoxin reductase system provides the minimal cytosolic components required for reducing proteins within the ER lumen.  In particular, saturation of the pathway and its protease sensitivity demonstrates the requirement for a membrane protein to shuttle electrons from the cytosol to the ER lumen.

While a multitude of workflows have been developed for multiplexed analyses, the most quantitatively accurate method (SPS-MS3) suffers from long acquisition duty cycles. We built a new, real-time database search (RTS) platform, Orbiter, to combat the SPS-MS3 method’s longer duty cycles. RTS with Orbiter eliminates SPS-MS3 scans if no peptide matches to a given spectrum. With Orbiter’s online proteomic analytical pipeline, which includes RTS and false discovery rate analysis, it was possible to process a single spectrum database search in less than 10 milliseconds. The result is a fast, functional means to identify peptide spectral matches using Comet, filter these matches, and more efficiently quantify proteins of interest. Importantly, the use of Comet for peptide spectral matching allowed for a fully featured search, including analysis of post-translational modifications, with well-known and extensively validated scoring. These data could then be used to trigger subsequent scans in an adaptive and flexible manner. In this work we tested the utility of this adaptive data acquisition platform to improve the efficiency and accuracy of multiplexed quantitative experiments. We found that RTS enabled a two-fold increase in mass spectrometric data acquisition efficiency. Orbiter’s RTS quantified more than 8000 proteins across 10 proteomes in half the time of an SPS-MS3 analysis (18 hours for RTS, 36 hours for SPS-MS3).","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","multiplexed, real-time search, Orbiter","Raw files were converted to mzXML format using an in-house adapted version of RawFileReader6 and searched using SEQUEST or Comet.

Activation of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) by its cognate chemokine ligands, including CCL2, plays a central role in recruitment of monocytes in several inflammatory diseases. In this study, we used phosphoproteomics to enable unbiased characterization of the signaling network resulting from CCL2 activation of CCR2. Using data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry, both the proteome and phosphoproteome were quantified for FlpIn-HEK293T cells stably expressing CCR2, at six time points after activation with CCL2, in comparison with untreated cells. Differential expression analysis identified 699 significantly regulated phosphorylation sites located on 441 proteins. As expected, many of these proteins participate in canonical signal transduction pathways and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, including numerous guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). In addition, we identified regulated phosphorylation sites in numerous proteins that exert functions in the nucleus, including several constituents of the nuclear pore complex.

Here we apply quantitative proteomics of N-linked glycoproteins to reveal how a collection of some 700 surface proteins is dramatically remodeled in an isogenic breast epithelial cell line stably expressing any of six of the most prominent proliferative oncogenes, including the receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR and HER2, and downstream signaling partners such as KRAS, BRAF, MEK and AKT. We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. Addition of a potent MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK signaling brings each oncogene-induced surfaceome back to a common state reflecting their strong dependence on the MAPK pathway to propagate signaling. Using a recently developed glyco-proteomics method of activated ion electron transfer dissociation (AI-ETD) we found massive oncogene-induced changes in 142 N-linked glycans and differential increases in complex hybrid glycans especially for KRAS and HER2 oncogenes. Overall, these studies provide a broad systems level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surface glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"",""Q Exactive""]","[""Biological"",""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC"",""TIC""]","Oncogenes, Glycoproteomics, Surfaceome, MAPK signaling pathway",Please refer to the bioRxiv preprint (DOI https://doi.org/10.1101/808139) for detailed explanation of all data processing protocols.,2020-01-09,"[[""DOI:10.1073/pnas.1917947117"",""PMID:32205440""]]"

Here we utilize the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to investigate how lncRNAs engage silencing activities to regulate gene expression in cis.  We find that invasion of lncRNA transcription into the downstream gene body incorporates a cryptic intron required for repression of that gene.  Our analyses show that lncRNAs containing cryptic introns are targeted by the conserved Pir2ARS2 protein in association with splicing factors, which recruit RNA processing and chromatin modifying activities involved in gene silencing.

Our analyses revealed that 88 proteins displayed divergent SUMOylation with elevated ATO compared to the lower dose, where the latter caused changes in SUMOylation of 4 proteins, including PML. Some of these differing SUMOylation events occurred on known substrates of caspase-3. A similar phenomenon was observed in the phosphoproteomic studies, where 48 proteins were specifically regulated with elevated ATO levels, while low ATO doses barely altered the phosphoproteome.

Extensive vesiculation impairs function and survival of red blood cells after transfusion, and microvesicles contribute to transfusion reactions. The triggers and mechanism of microvesicle generation are largely unknown. In this study, we combined morphological, immunochemical, proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic analyses in order to obtain an integrated understanding of the mechanisms underlying microvesicle generation during storage of red blood cell concentrates. Our data indicate that changes in membrane organization, triggered by altered protein conformation, constitute the main mechanism of vesiculation, and precede changes in lipid organization. The resulting selective accumulation of membrane components in microvesicles is accompanied by the recruitment of plasma proteins involved in inflammation and coagulation. Our data may serve as a basis for further dissection of the fundamental mechanisms of red blood cell aging and vesiculation, for identifying the cause-effect relationship between blood bank storage and transfusion complications, and for assessing the role of microvesicles in pathologies affecting red blood cells.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""blood""]",,"[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","Proteomics, RBC, Blood, Lipidomics, Metabolomics","The MaxQuant - Andromeda search engine integrated in the MaxQuant software (Version 1.3.0.5) was used for identifying proteins.

With currently available therapies, cure of advanced and metastatic ccRCC is achieved only in rare cases. Here, we developed a workflow integrating different -omics technologies to identify ccRCC-specific HLA-presented peptides as potential drug targets for ccRCC immunotherapy. We analyzed frequent ccRCC-specific peptides by MS-based HLA ligandomics of 55 ccRCC tumors (cohort 1), paired non-tumor renal tissues and 158 benign tissues from other organs. Pathways enriched in ccRCC compared to its cell type of origin were identified by transcriptome and gene set enrichment analyses in 51 tumor tissues of the same cohort. To retrieve a list of candidate target genes with involvement in ccRCC pathogenesis, ccRCC-specific pathway genes were intersected with the source genes of tumor-exclusive peptides. The candidates were validated in an independent cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA KIRC, n=452), yielding 113 candidate genes. DNA methylation (TCGA KIRC, n=273), and somatic mutations (TCGA KIRC, n=392), as well as correlations with tumor metabolites (cohort 1, n=30) and immune-oncological markers (cohort 1, n=37) were analyzed to refine regulatory and functional involvements of candidates. Immunogenicity analysis identified candidate epitopes able to activate native CD8+ T cells. Functional analysis of EGLN3, a candidate with frequent ccRCC-specific immunogenic peptides, revealed possible tumor-promoting functions. Integration of HLA ligandomics, transcriptomics, genetic and epigenetic data leads to the identification of novel functionally relevant therapeutic targets for ccRCC immunotherapy.

NKEVs are constitutively secreted, are biologically active, reflect the protein and genetic repertoire of their originating cells and exert anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. NKEVs from tumor-conditioned NK cells interact with naïve NK cells promoting their cytotoxic activity. In cancer NK cells exhibit profound defects in degranulation ability, a status probably reflected by their NKEVs. Hence, NKEVs could contribute to improve cancer therapy by interacting with tumor and/or immune cells at the same time sensing the actual NK cell status in cancer patients.  Here we investigated the role of NKEVs in stimulating the immune system and developed an immune enzymatic test (NKExoELISA) to sense the systemic NK cell status by measuring plasma NK-derived exosomes through combined capture of exosomes, expressing typical EV (tsg101) and NK cell (CD56) markers. We analyzed by LC-MS/MS the protein content from NKEVs evaluating  proteins differentially expressed in exosomes (NKExo), vescicles (NKMV)  and total cell extract (Tot extr) from parental NK cells.

However, variable bait levels between replicates can convolute interactor identification. We compared the Student's t difference test and Pearson's R correlation as methods to generate t-statistics and assessed the significance of interactors following TMT-AP-MS. Using a simple linear model of protein recovery in immunoprecipitates to simulate reporter ion ratio distributions, we found that correlation-derived t-statistics protect against bait variance while robustly controlling Type I errors (false positives). We experimentally determined the performance of these two approaches for determining t-statistics under two experimental conditions: irreversible prey association to the Hsp40 mutant DNAJB8H31Q followed by stringent washing, and reversible association to 14 3 3 with gentle washing. Correlation-derived t-statistics performed at least as well as difference test t-statistics for each sample, with substantial improvement in performance for experiments with high bait level variance.

We have previously reported that chromodomain Y-like transcription corepressor CDYL acts as a crotonyl-CoA hydratase and negatively regulates histone Kcr. However, the global crotonylome of CDYL-regulated Kcr on non-histone substrates remains unclear. Using proteome-wide quantitative Kcr analysis, we identified 14,311 Kcr sites across 3,734 proteins in HeLa cells, providing by far the largest crotonylome data set from a single study. Upon depletion of CDYL, 1,141 Kcr sites from 759 proteins were increased by more than 1.5 fold, and 933 Kcr sites from 528 proteins were decreased by more than 0.67 fold. Upregulated crotonylome alterations upon CDYL depletion include components from diverse cellular pathways such as RNA splicing, DNA replication, and amino acid metabolism. Specifically, CDYL regulates K88 and K379 of crotonylation on RPA1, which affects its binding to other DNA repair factors including BLM, DNA2L, RAD50 and WRN. We showed evidence that CDYL-mediated RPA1 crotonylation is critical for the homologous recombination (HR) repair of camptothecin (CPT)-induced DNA damage. Together, our results provide a broad lysine crotonylome in response to CDYL and shed new light on the role of RPA1 Kcr in DNA repair, implicating functional importance of Kcr on non-histone substrates in diverse cellular processes.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""whole body""]",,"[""Q Exactive Plus""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,CDYL;Crotonylation; RPA1;DNA Repair,"The resulting MS/MS data were processed using MaxQuant with integrated Andromeda search engine (v.1.5.2.8).

More recently, proteomics analyses have shown that per-O-acetylated MCRs can directly and chemically react with cysteine residues in lysates and potentially cells, drawing into question the physiological relevance of the labeling. Here, we report robust cellular labeling by Ac42AzMan but not the structurally-similar Ac44AzGal. However, the levels of background chemical-labeling of cell lysates by both reporters are low and identical. We then characterized Ac42AzMan labeling and found that the vast majority of the labeling occurs on intracellular proteins but that this MCR is not converted to previously characterized reporters of intracellular O-GlcNAc modification. Additionally, we used IsoTag proteomics to show that essentially all of the Ac42AzMan labeling is on cysteine residues. Given the implications this result has for the identification of intracellular O-GlcNAc modifications using MCRs, we then performed a meta-analysis of the potential O-GlcNAcylated proteins identified by different techniques. We found that many of the proteins identified by MCRs have also been found by other methods. Finally, we randomly selected four proteins that had only been characterized as O-GlcNAcylated by MCRs and showed that half of them were indeed modified.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""lung""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"O-GlcNAc modifications, Ac44AzGal, Ac42AzMan, IsoTag","The raw data was processed using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

This approach results in the accurate identification of hundreds of shared and tumor-specific non-canonical HLAp.

Both Andromeda and Comet provided good results in preliminary tests, their scoring methods performed well for HLAp peptides, and they allowed searching for peptides with and without variants. Andromeda matched the MS/MS spectra of each sample against their personalized reference libraries (mentioned above). Similarly, the variants were annotated in the PEFF format (http://www.psidev.info/peff) for Comet. Both search tools were run with the same principal search parameters: precursor mass tolerance 20ppm, MS/MS fragment tolerance 0.02 Da, peptide length 8-15 for HLA-I only and 8-25 for HLA-I and HLA-II peptides, Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term) as variable modifications and no fixed modifications. A PSM FDR of 3% was used for Andromeda as a first filter, and nonc reference sequences were loaded into the “proteogenomics fasta files” module for separate FDR calculations for prot and nonc sequences. To assure that nonc peptide sequences do not match other protein coding genes, all peptides found by Andromeda or Comet were aligned against the UniProt (www.uniprot.org) sequence database (human reviewed sequences with isoforms, downloaded 18/12/2018), where leucine and iso-leucines were treated as equal since they are not distinguishable by mass spectrometry. If peptides were found matching standard UniProt sequences, they were assigned as prot with the UniProt IDs. However, we assigned and kept TE peptide sequences that matched  annotated TEs that were integrated into the human reference in UniProt.  As schematically described in Supplementary Figure 1, the Comet FDR calculation was done separately for prot and nonc PSMs with an in-house software written in Java, which utilizes the MzJava class library77. All PSMs resulting from the Comet search, including the decoy PSMs (decoy hits originating from reversed sequences), were split into three sublists with PSMs of charge (Z) 1, 2, and charge 3 or higher. The three Comet scores XCorr, deltaCn and spScore were considered. It has been shown that when feature vectors are partitioned into different groups, group-wise local FDR (lFDR) calculation provides the most sensitive decision boundaries, for controlling the global FDR78. Therefore, the 3D space (XCorr, deltaCn and spScore) was partitioned into small cells (40 intervals in each dimension) and the lFDR was estimated for each cell. We used the following equation to calculate the lFDR:  (1) lFDR(x,Z)=(π_0 p(x│Z,H=0))/(π_0 p(x│Z,H=0)+π_1 p(x│Z,H=1) )=(1+π_1/π_0 ∙(p(x│Z,H=1))/(p(x│Z,H=0) ))^(-1) =(1+π_1/π_0  γ(x,Z))^(-1)         where π_0 and π_1 are the class probabilities for true (H=1) and wrong (H=0) PSMs, and  p(x│Z,H=0,1) are the probability distributions for feature vector  x=(XCorr,deltaCn,spScore) of PSMs with charge Z. The probability ratio γ(x,Z) is estimated for every cell and charge using all the target and decoy PSMs. The π_1⁄π_0  ratios are calculated for the nonc and prot groups separately and then the π_1⁄π_0  ratios are plugged into Equation (1). This way the lFDR values are calculated for every cell for both groups. For each cell, the number of wrong hits (n0) is set to the number of decoy hits in that cell, while the number of true hits (n1) is set to the number of target hits minus n0. These counts are then smoothed by replacing the values to average counts of the neighboring cells. Then γ(x,Z)=n_1⁄n_0  or γ(x,Z)=1 if n0 = 0. The target and decoy PSMs are further split into nonc and prot PSMs. Since there usually are not enough PSMs to estimate γ(x,Z) for the nonc group, γ(x,Z) is taken from all PSMs but π_1⁄π_0  is adapted for each group. Therefore, it is assumed that the score distributions are the same for each group, but that the ratio of true to wrong PSMs may change. The π_1⁄π_0  ratios are calculated for the nonc and prot groups separately and then the π_1⁄π_0  ratios are plugged into Equation (1). This way the lFDR values are calculated for every cell for both groups separately. The π_1⁄π_0  ratio in the nonc group is relatively smaller than the prot π_1⁄π_0  ratio, because the nonc database is larger and mostly consists of peptides that are not present in the sample.  This will lead to a larger nonc lFDR value, and to a more conservative filtering of nonc PSMs. Finally, the lFDR threshold is adjusted to allow a global FDR of 1% for the nonc and prot groups. PSMs from both search tools were combined and only the intersection, meaning PSMs with identical Comet and Andromeda matches (same peptide sequence with the same modification) were retained.",2020-01-17,"[[""DOI:10.1038/s41467-020-14968-9"",""PMID:32157095""]]"

A major driver of OSCC is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) with 12 N-glycosylation sites whose activity is aberrantly upregulated in 80-90% of tumors. EGFR antennary-fucosylated glycans have been shown to suppress EGFR dimerization and signaling in lung adenocarcinoma. High levels of fucosylated glycan epitopes have also been observed in OSCC, but invasive regions lose expression of linkage-specific fucosylated epitopes, suggesting that certain fucosylated glycans are involved in the suppression of cell growth and invasion. We found that EGFR from metastatic HSC-3 cells has low levels of fucosylated N-glycans, while EGFR from non-metastatic CAL27 cells shows higher levels of fucosylation at multiple EGFR glycosylation sites including sites N420 and N579, via nUPLC-MS/MS. In cell culture and in mouse tumor xenografts, treatment with ICG-001, a small molecule inhibitor of the interaction between nuclear -catenin and CREB-binding protein (CBP) resulted in higher expression of FUT2 and FUT3, higher fucosylation of EGFR at sites N420 and N579, and decreased EGFR abundance. In addition, we have performed in-depth characterization of multiply-fucosylated N-glycans via glycopeptide tandem mass spectrometry to understand which fucosylated glycan epitopes are involved in the observed effect.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"",""6550 iFunnel Q-TOF LC/MS"",""Q Exactive""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]","Human, LC-MS/MS, EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor, OSCC, oral squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, CAL27, HSC-3, beta-catenin/CBP inhibition, CREB-binding protein, glycopeptide, glycoproteomics","Analysis of Peptide and Glycopeptide nUPLC-MS/MS Data.

To initiate their assembly, coordinated actions of multiple proteins are needed. Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a key player in the cilium assembly pathway, controlling final step of cilia initiation. The function of TTBK2 in ciliogenesisis critically dependent on its kinase activity, however, precise mechanism of action of this kinase is so far incompletely understood, in part due to very limited information about its relevant substrates. In this study we identify CEP83, CEP89, CCDC92, Rabin8 and DVL3 as substrates of TTBK2 kinase activity. Further, we characterise a set of phosphosites of the newly identified substrates and CEP164, induced by TTBK2 in vitro and in vivo and show that TTBK2 preferentially phosphorylates examined substrates at intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs).  Intriguingly, we further show that identified TTBK2 phosphosites and consensus sequence delineated from those are distinct from motifs previously assigned to TTBK2. Finally, we address functional relevance of selected phosphorylations of CEP164 and provide evidence that the examined TTBK2-induced phosphorylations of CEP164 are relevant for the process of cilia formation.

However, the inherently low abundance of tyrosine phosphorylation in the proteome and the inefficient enrichment of phosphotyrosine(pTyr)-containing peptides has led to poor pTyr peptide identification and quantitation, critically hindering researchers’ ability to elucidate signaling pathways regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation in systems where cellular material is limited. The most popular approaches to wide-scale characterization of the tyrosine phosphoproteome use pTyr enrichment with pan-specific, anti-pTyr antibodies from a large amount of starting material.  Methods that decrease the amount of starting material and increase the characterization depth of the tyrosine phosphoproteome while maintaining quantitative accuracy and precision would enable the discovery of tyrosine phosphorylation networks in rarer cell populations. To achieve these goals, a novel method leveraging the multiplexing capability of tandem mass tags (TMT) and the use of trigger channels – cells treated with the promiscuous tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (PV) – selectively increased the relative abundance of pTyr-containing peptides. After PV facilitated selective fragmentation of pTyr-containing peptides, TMT reporter ions delivered sensitive quantitation of each peptide for the experimental samples while the quantitation from PV trigger channels was ignored. This method yielded up to 6.3-fold boost in quantification depth of statistically significant data derived from contrived ratios, compared to TMT without trigger channels or intensity-based label-free (LF) quantitation while maintaining quantitative accuracy and precision, allowing quantitation of over 2300 unique pTyr peptides from only 1 mg of T cell receptor-stimulated Jurkat T cells. The trigger channel strategy can potentially be applied in analyses of other post-translational modifications where treatments that broadly boost the levels of those modifications across the proteome are available.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""JURKAT cell""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""TMT""]","Tandem mass tags, pervanadate, trigger channel, superbinder, phosphotyrosine proteomics","Raw files were processed in MaxQuant13 version 1.6.3.3 using the integrated peptide search engine Andromeda14.

A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was set on peptide spectrum match (PSM) employing a target-decoy approach. The following parameters were used: precursor ion tolerance of 3 ppm, ITMS MS/MS fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.5 Da, trypsin enzyme cleavage specificity, three maximum possible missed cleavages permitted, a minimum peptide length of 6 amino acids, maximum peptide mass of 4800 Da, fixed modification of carbamidomethylation on cysteine, variable modifications of oxidation on methionine and phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine, and a maximum of 5 modifications per peptide. “Match-between-runs” was enabled for label-free data with the default retention time window of 2 minutes. For TMT samples, additional modifications included TMT-11plex labels on N-termini and lysine residues, where reporter ion MS3 with reporter mass tolerance of 0.005 Da was defined. All downstream analyses and graphical plotting were performed in R or Microsoft Excel based on MaxQuant output files. The rationale of the experimental design is described in detail in the results section. Equal amounts of peptide were used in each labeling reaction so that the amount of peptide and label remained proportional in separate labeling steps. Three technical replicates each of 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg and 1.0 mg labeled peptides using the protein concentration derived from BCA Protein Assay were combined to create the contrived ratios of 10:1, 10:3, and 3:1. Technical, not biological, replicates were chosen to minimize biological sample variation that would otherwise hinder our ability to determine the quantitative accuracy of this experiment from predetermined contrived ratios, which is one of the core elements in the data analysis. LF experiments with a similar setup were included as a control alongside TMT experiments as a comparison. Similar amounts of peptide input were used for pTyr peptide enrichment in all comparisons to maintain approximately equal sample-to-bead ratio. Both TMT and LF experiments are limited to approximately equal instrument time. Each TMT experiment had a total of twelve fractionated LC/MS runs, whereas LF experiment had a total of eleven unfractionated LC/MS runs. LF LC/MS runs had a similar or greater total number of MS and MS/MS scans compared to TMT experiments, making both LF and TMT experiments highly comparable.

Segments form from the rostral end of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) with a periodicity that is regulated by the segmentation clock. The segmentation clock is a molecular oscillator that exhibits dynamic clock gene expression across the PSM with a periodicity that matches somite formation. Notch signalling is crucial to this process. Altering Notch intracellular domain (NICD) stability affects both the clock period and somite size. However, the mechanism by which NICD stability is regulated in this context is unclear. We identified a highly conserved site crucial for NICD recognition by the SCF E3 ligase, which targets NICD for degradation. We demonstrate both CDK1 and CDK2 can phosphorylate NICD in the domain where this crucial residue lies and that NICD levels vary in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Inhibiting CDK1 or CDK2 activity increases NICD levels both in vitro and in vivo, leading to a delay of clock gene oscillations and an increase in somite size.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""kidney""]",,"[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]",,"[""Gel-based experiment""]",,"Cell cycle, FBXW7, Notch, Phosphorylation, Signalling, Somitogenesis","Data files were analysed by Proteome Discoverer 2.0 (Thermo), using Mascot 2.4.1 (www.matrixscience.com), and searching against the Swissprot and MRC-PPU (University of Dundee) databases.

The anthraquinone Rhein was examined for its anti-fibrotic potency to mitigate cardiac fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT). Primary human ventricular cardiac fibroblasts were subjected to hypoxia and characterized with proteomics, transcriptomics and cell functional techniques. Knowledge based analyses of the omics data revealed a modulation of fibrosis-associated pathways and cell cycle due to Rhein administration during hypoxia, whereas p53 and p21 were identified as upstream regulators involved in the manifestation of cardiac fibroblast phenotypes. Mechanistically, Rhein-mediated cellular effects were linked to the histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent acetylation status of p53 a posttranslational modification that acts protein stabilizing. Direct enzymatic testing revealed an inhibitory potency of Rhein for HDAC classes I/II. Functionally, Rhein inhibited collagen contraction in response to protein abundance of SMAD7, thus demonstrating its anti-fibrotic property in cardiac remodeling. In conclusion, this study identifies Rhein as a novel potent HDAC inhibitor and provides evidence that Rhein may contribute to the treatment of cardiac fibrosis as anti-fibrotic agent.

After clinical suspicion of this disorder, including progressive retinitis pigmentosa and polyneuropathy, Refsum disease is biochemically diagnosed by elevated levels of phytanic acid in plasma and tissues of the patient. To date, no cure exists for Refsum disease, but phytanic acid levels in patients can be reduced by plasmapheresis and a strict diet. In recent years, computational models have become valuable tools to provide insight into the complex behaviour of metabolic networks. Besides the comprehensive models that contain all known metabolic reactions within the human body, several tissue- and cell-type-specific models have been developed. However, while systems biology approaches are widely used for complex diseases, only few studies have been published for inborn errors of metabolism. In this study, we reconstructed a fibroblast-specific genome-scale model based on the recently published, FAD-curated model, based on Recon3D reconstruction. We used transcriptomics, exo-metabolomics, and proteomics data, which we obtained from healthy controls and Refsum disease patient fibroblasts incubated with phytol, a precursor of phytanic acid. Our model correctly represents the metabolism of phytanic acid and displays fibroblast-specific metabolic functions. Using this model, we investigated the metabolic phenotype of Refsum disease at the genome scale, and we studied the effect of phytanic acid on cell metabolism. We identified 20 metabolites that were predicted to discriminate between Healthy and Refsum’s Disease patients, whereof several with a link to amino acid metabolism.

It is revealed that NCL strongly binds to long-loop (9-5 nt) G4 whilst interacting weakly with the shorter variants (loop < 3nt). Photocrosslinking experiments using 5-bromouracil (BrdU) modified sequences further confirmed the loop-length dependency thereby indicating that the CEB25-WT (9nt) is the best G4 substrate. Quantitative proteomic analysis (LC-MS/MS) of the photocrosslinking product(s) obtained with NCL bound to this sequence enabled the identification of one contact site within the 9nt loop. The protein fragment identified is located in the helix of the RBD2 domain of NCL, shedding light on the role of this structural element in the G4-loop recognition. Then, the ability of a panel of benchmark G4 ligands to prevent the NCL/G4 interaction was explored. It was found that only the most potent ligand PhenDC3 is able to inhibit NCL binding, thereby suggesting that the terminal guanine quartet is also a strong determinant of G4 recognition, putatively through interaction with the RGG domain. This study puts forward the molecular mechanism by which NCL recognizes G4-containing long loops and leads to propose a model implying a concerted action of RBD2 and RGG domains to achieve specific G4 recognition via a dual loop-quartet interaction.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,,"[""Orbitrap Fusion""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,"Nucleolin, G-Quadruplex, RNA binding domain, RGG domain, long loop, proteomics, photo-crosslinking, G4-ligands","For identification, data were searched against the Human (UP000005640) UniProt and the NCL construct databases using Mascot 2.5.

The exact mechanism behind dopaminergic cell death is still not completely understood and, so far, no cure or neuroprotective treatment for PD is available. Recent studies have brought attention to the wide array of bioactive molecules produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), generally referred to as the secretome. Herein, we evaluated whether human MSCs-bone marrow derived (hBMSCs) secretome would be beneficial in a PD pre-clinical model, when compared directly with cell transplantation of hBMSCs alone. We used a 6-hydroxydpomanie (6-OHDA) rat PD model, and motor behavior was evaluated at different time points after treatments (1, 4 and 7 weeks). The impact of the treatments in the recovery of DA neurons was estimated by determining TH-positive neuronal densities in the substantia nigra and fibers in the striatum, respectively, at the end of the behavioral characterization. Furthermore, we determined the effect of the hBMSCs secretome on the neuronal survival of human neural progenitors in vitro, and characterized the secretome through proteomic-based approaches. This work demonstrates that the injection of hBMSCs secretome potentiated the histological recovery of DA neurons, when compared to transplantation of hBMSCs themselves, a fact that probably explains the improved behavioral performance of secretome-injected animals in the staircase test. Moreover, we observed that hBMSCs secretome induces higher levels of in vitro neuronal differentiation. Finally, the proteomic analysis revealed that hBMSCs secrete a variety of important exosome-related molecules such as those related with the ubiquitin-proteasome and histone systems. Overall, this work provided important insights on the potential use of hBMSCs secretome as a therapeutic tool for PD, and further confirms the importance of the secreted molecules rather than the transplantation of hBMSCs for the observed positive effects. These could be likely through normalization of defective processes in PD, namely proteostasis or altered gene transcription, which lately can lead to neuroprotective effects.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,,"[""TripleTOF 5600""]",,"[""SWATH MS""]",,"Parkinson's diasese, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Secretome, dopamine neurons, Neuroprotection","In order to characterize the hBMSCs secretome we performed a non-targeted proteomic analysis based on a combined mass spectrometry (MS) approach as previously described (Mendes-Pinheiro et al., 2018).

Here, we tested how the oncogenes AKT and MYC affect the ability to shift between respiration and glycolysis. Using immortalized mammary epithelial cellsMCF10A, we discovered constitutively active AKT but not MYC induced cell death in galactose culture, where cells must rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy generation. However, the negative effects of AKT were short-lived, and AKT-expressing cells recommenced growth after ~15 days in galactose culture. To identify the mechanisms regulating AKT-mediated cell death, we first used metabolomics and found that AKT cells dying in galactose culture exhibited upregulated glutathione metabolism. Next, using shotgun proteomics, we discovered AKT cells dying in galactose upregulated proteins related to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a known response to oxidative stress. We therefore measured levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and discovered galactose culture induced ROS only in cells expressing AKT. Additionally, we found thatdiscovered the ROS scavenger catalase rescued AKT-expressing cells from galactose culture-induced cell death. We then demonstrated that breast cancer cell lines with constitutively active AKT signaling also exhibited cell death in galactose culture and rescue by catalase.

Understanding the intrinsic heterogeneities of HCC associated with AFP levels is essential for the molecular mechanism studies of HCC with different AFP levels as well as for the potential early diagnosis and personalized treatment of HCC with AFP negative. Here, an integrated glycoproteomic and proteomic analysis of low and high AFP level of HCC tumors was performed to investigate the intrinsic heterogeneities of site-specific glycosylation associated with different AFP levels of HCC. we identified many commonly altered site-specific glycans from HCC tumors regardless of AFP levels, including decreased modifications by oligo-mannose and sialylated bi-antennary glycans, and increased modifications by bisecting glycans. By relative quantifying the intact glycopeptides between low and high AFP tumor groups, the great heterogeneities of site-specific N-glycans between two groups of HCC tumors were also uncovered. We found that several sialylated but not core fucosylated tri-antennary glycans were uniquely high-regulated in low AFP level of HCC tumors, while many core fucosylated bi-antennary or hybrid glycans as well as bisecting glycans were uniquely increased in high AFP tumors.

Both APOL1 and APOL3 form K+ channels, but only APOL3 exhibited Ca2+-dependent binding to neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), promoting NCS-1/PI4KB interaction that strongly activates PI(4)P  synthesis. APOL1 C-terminal deletion or mutations increased APOL1 binding to APOL3, affecting APOL3 interaction with NCS-1.

Ubiquitin itself is encoded by four different genes, either as single copy of ubiquitin fused to ribosomal proteins, or by polyubiquitin precursors3. Early studies identified several additional genes potentially coding for ubiquitin, but they were considered as pseudogenes due to differences in amino acids, or lack of apparent transcription4-6. Through analysis of large-scale proteomics and RNA sequencing experiments, we found evidence for expression at the mRNA and protein levels of several ubiquitin pseudogenes. Our results show that UBBP4, a pseudogene of the UBB subfamily, produces functional ubiquitin proteins with different amino acids composition compared to the canonical sequence. These ubiquitins variants are covalently conjugated to proteins that are different from ubiquitin, and proteins modified by UBBP4 are not targeted for proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, invalidation of UBBP4 results in slower cell division, and accumulation of lamin A within the nucleolus. This implies that a subset of proteins reported as ubiquitin targets could rather be through these variants arising from wrongly annotated pseudogenes, and that there is a specificity in the modification and differences in the functional consequence of proteins modified by these new ubiquitin variants. The identification of additional ubiquitins thus entails a new layer of complexity in protein ubiquitylation that has been unnoticed until now.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,,"[""Q Exactive""]",,"[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""SILAC""]","Ubiquitin, Pseudogene, Lamin A, Nucleolus","Mass spectrometry and quantification.

Here, we show that E4orf4’s tumoricidal activity correlated with changes in perinuclear actomyosin contractility that are controlled by an interaction with the Par3 polarity protein. Surprisingly, E4orf4 enhanced apical-basal polarity in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. In contrast, in tumorigenic cells, it induced a high incidence of actin-dependent nuclear bleb rupture. This process, which was regulated by the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, promoted nuclear efflux of E4orf4 and the breakdown of the nuclear compartment. Significantly, Par3 also regulated the incidence of transient nuclear envelope rupture due to the reduced nuclear rigidity in cells depleted of lamins, in absence of E4orf4. Thus, using E4orf4 as a probing tool, we uncovered a so far un-appreciated role for Par3 in controlling the actin-dependent forces acting on the nuclear envelope to remodel nuclear shape, which might be a defining feature of tumor cells that is harnessed by E4orf4.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,,"[""TripleTOF 5600"",""QSTAR""]",,"[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics""]","[""Peptide counting""]","E4orf4, polarity proteins, actin, live cell dynamics, nuclear bleb, lamin A/C","We used data from 3 independent AP-MS experiments.

Previous studies have focused on two subgroups of HLA-B*51 peptidome containing Proline (Pro) or Alanine (Ala) at position 2 (P2). Little is known about the unconventional non-Pro/Ala2 HLA-B*51-bound peptides. We aimed to study the features of this novel sub-peptidome, and investigate its regulation by ERAP1. CRISPR-Cas9 was used to generate an HLA-ABC-knockout HeLa cell line (HeLa.ABC-KO), which was subsequently transduced to express HLA-B*51:01 (HeLa.ABC-KO.B51). ERAP1 was silenced using lentiviral shRNA. Peptides bound to HLA-B*51:01 were eluted and analyzed by Mass Spectrometry. The characteristics of non-Pro/Ala2, Pro2 and Ala2 peptides, and their alteration by ERAP1 silencing were investigated. Effects of ERAP1 silencing on cell surface expression of HLA-B*51:01 were studied using flow cytometry. More than 20% of peptides eluted from HLA-B*51:01 lacked Proline or Alanine at P2. This unconventional group of HLA-B*51:01-bound peptides was enriched for 8-mers (with fewer 9-mers) compared to Pro2 and Ala2 sub-peptidomes, and had similar N-terminal and C-terminal residue usages to Ala2 peptides with the exception of the less abundant Leucine at position Ω. Knockdown of ERAP1 increased the percentage of non-Pro/Ala2 to approximately 40%, increased the percentage of longer (10-mer and 11-mer) peptides eluted from HLA-B*51:01 complexes, and abrogated the predominance of Leucine at P1. Interestingly knockdown of ERAP1 altered the length and N-terminal residue usage of non-Ala2&Pro2 and Ala2 but not the Pro2 peptides. Finally, ERAP1 silencing regulated the expression levels of cell surface HLA-B*51 in a cell type - dependent manner. The HLA-B*51:01 peptidome includes a surprisingly high proportion of unconventional non-Pro/Ala2 peptides which are increased by ERAP1 silencing, mimicking the loss-of-function BD risk variant.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion Lumos""]","[""Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)"",""Human Proteome Project"",""Biomedical""]","[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]",,ERAP1; HLA–B*51:01; BEHÇET’S DISEASE,"MS data was analyzed with Peaks 7 (Bioinformatics Solutions) for identification of peptide sequences.

PXD017538,https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD017538,The heme regulatory motifs of heme oxygenase-2 function to transfer heme to the catalytic site for degradation,"Heme regulatory motifs (HRMs) are found in a variety of proteins that are involved in diverse biological functions. In the C-terminal tail region of human heme oxygenase-2 (HO2), there are two HRMs whose cysteines form a disulfide bond; when reduced, these cysteines are available to bind Fe3+-heme. Heme binding to the HRMs is independent of the HO2 catalytic active site in the core of the protein, where heme binds with high affinity and is degraded to biliverdin. Here, we describe the reversible, protein-mediated transfer of heme between the HRMs and the core of HO2. Using HDX-MS to monitor the dynamics of HO2 with and without Fe3+-heme bound to the HRMs and to the core, we detected conformational changes in the catalytic core only in one state of the catalytic cycle – when Fe3+-heme is bound to the HRMs and the core is in the apo state. The conformational changes detected are consistent with transfer of heme between binding sites. Indeed, Fe3+-heme bound to the HRMs is transferred to the apo-core upon either independently expressing the core and a construct spanning the HRM-containing tail or after single turnover of heme at the core. In addition, we observed transfer of heme from the core to the HRMs and equilibration of heme between the core and HRMs. We thus propose a Fe3+-heme transfer model in which heme bound to the HRMs is readily transferred to the catalytic site for degradation to facilitate turnover but can also equilibrate between the sites to maintain heme homeostasis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,,"[""Synapt MS""]",,"[""HDMSE""]",,enzyme mechanisms; enzyme kinetics; protein dynamics; conformational change; hydrogen deuterium exchange; HDXMS,"Peptides were identified using PLGS 3.0.1 (Waters, RRID: SCR_016664, 720001408EN) using three replicates of undeuterated control samples.

We find that 91% of the patients have metastases carrying inactivating events in the tumor suppressor BAP1 and this coincided with somatic alterations in GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2, PLCB4, SF3B1 and/or CDKN2A. Mutational signature analysis revealed a rare subset of tumors with prominent signs of UV damage, associated with outlier mutational burden. We study copy number variations (CNV) and find overrepresented events, some of which were not altered in matched primary eye tumors. A focused siRNA screen identified functionally significant genes of some of the segments recurrently gained. We reintroduced a functional copy of BAP1 into a patient-derived BAP1 deficient tumor cell line and found broad transcriptomic changes of genes associated with subtype distinction and prognosis in primary UM.

NatA, contains NAA10 catalytic and NAA15 auxiliary subunits, and forms a complex with a protein with intrinsic NAA10 inhibitory activity, HYPK. The molecular basis for how the human NAA10 and NAA50 catalytic subunits within NatE complex coordinate function and how HYPK regulates NatE activity is unknown. Here, we characterize the biochemical interplay between the human NAA10 and NAA50 catalytic subunits of NatE and its regulation by HYPK and correlate this to the cryo-EM structures of the human NatE and NatE/HYPK complexes. We show that NAA50 and HYPK exhibit negative cooperative binding to NatA in vitro and in human cells, by inducing NAA15 shifts in opposing directions. NAA50 and HYPK each contributes to NAA10 activity inhibition through structural alteration of the NAA10 substrate binding site. NatE is about 8-fold more active than NAA50, likely due to a reduced entropic cost for substrate binding through NatA tethering, but is inhibited by HYPK through structural alteration of the NatE substrate binding site.

Its general workflow consists of three main steps: sample preparation, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and computational data analysis. Quality assessment of the different steps and components of this workflow is instrumental to identify technical flaws and to avoid loss of precious measurement time and sample material. However, assessment of the extent of sample losses along the sample preparation protocol, in particular after proteolytic digestion, is not yet routinely implemented because of the lack of an accurate and straightforward method to quantify peptides. Here, we report on the use of a microfluidic UV/visible spectrophotometer to quantify MS-ready peptides directly in MS loading solvent, consuming only 2 µl of sample. We compared the performance of the microfluidic spectrophotometer with a standard device and determined the optimal sample amount for LC-MS/MS analysis on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer using a dilution series of a commercial K562 cell digest. Careful evaluation of selected LC and MS parameters allowed us to define 3 µg as an optimal peptide amount to be injected on this particular LC-MS/MS system. Finally, using tryptic digests from human HEK293T cells and showed that injecting equal peptide amounts, rather than approximate ones, results in less variable LC-MS/MS and protein quantification data.

TOP1 is also a major driver of endogenous genome instability, particularly when its catalytic intermediate - a covalent TOP1-DNA adduct known as a TOP1 cleavage complex (TOP1cc) - is stabilised.  TOP1ccs are highly cytotoxic and a failure to resolve them underlies the pathology of neurological disorders but is also exploited in cancer therapy where TOP1ccs are the target of widely used frontline anti-cancer drugs. A critical enzyme for TOP1cc resolution is the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase, TDP1, which hydrolyses the bond that links a tyrosine in the active site of TOP1 to a 3’ phosphate group on a single-stranded (ss)DNA break. However, TDP1 can only process small peptide fragments from ssDNA ends, raising the question of how the ~90 kDa TOP1 protein is processed upstream of TDP1. We find that TEX264 fulfils this role by forming a complex with the p97 ATPase and the SPRTN metalloprotease. We show that TEX264 recognises both unmodified and SUMO1-modifed TOP1 and initiates TOP1cc repair by recruiting p97 and SPRTN.

PXD017425,https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD017425,Transferrin receptor is a specific ferroptosis marker,"Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death driven by the iron-dependent accumulation of oxidized polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-containing phospholipids (PUFA-PLs). Three key molecular features of ferroptosis are peroxidation of PUFA-PLs, accumulation of redox-active ferrous iron, and defective lipid peroxide repair (Dixon and Stockwell, 2019). However, there is currently no reliable way to selectively stain ferroptotic cells in tissue sections to characterize the extent of ferroptosis in animal models of disease and in patient tissue samples. We sought to address this gap by immunizing mice with membranes from lymphoma cells treated with the ferroptosis inducer piperazine erastin (PE), and screening ~4,750 of the resulting monoclonal antibodies generated for their ability to selectively detect cells undergoing ferroptosis. We found that one antibody, termed 3F3 Ferroptotic Membrane Antibody (3F3-FMA), was effective as a selective ferroptosis-staining reagent using immunofluorescence (IF). The antigen of 3F3-FMA was identified by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry as the human transferrin receptor 1 protein (TfR1), which imports iron from the extracellular environment into cells. We validated this finding with several additional anti-TfR1 antibodies, and compared them to other potential ferroptosis-detecting reagents via immunofluorescence staining, using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. We found that anti-TfR1 and anti-malondialdehyde (MDA) adduct antibodies were effective at reliably staining ferroptotic tumor cells in numerous cell culture and tissue contexts. In summary, these findings suggest that anti-TfR1 antibodies can be used to selectively label cells undergoing ferroptosis.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion""]",,"[""Top-down proteomics""]","[""MaxQuant percentage""]","Antigen, Ferroptosis, IP-MSMS","Raw mass spectrometric data were analyzed using MaxQuant v.1.6.1.0 (Cox and Mann, 2008)  (MaxQuant, RRID:SCR_014485) and employed Andromeda for database search(Cox et al., 2011) at default settings with a few modifications.

Periventricular heterotopia (PH) is a rare and heterogeneous disorder in which a subpopulation of new-born projection neurons fails to initiate their radial migration to the cortex, ultimately resulting in bands or nodules of grey matter lining the lateral ventricles underneath a normal cortex. For many years, few genes had been identified that cause this disorder upon disruption, but recently it was shown that PH is genetically a very heterogeneous disease. Here, we study the neurodevelopmental role of endothelin converting enzyme 2 (ECE2), biallelic mutations in which have been identified in two patients with PH. Our results show that manipulation of ECE2 levels or activity in human cerebral organoids and in the developing mouse cortex leads to ectopic localization of neural progenitors and neurons. We uncover the role of ECE2 in neurogenesis and, mechanistically, we identify its involvement in generation and secretion of extracellular matrix and in protein phosphorylation. This strongly suggests ECE2 as a novel candidate gene for PH.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""Q Exactive""]","[""Biomedical""]","[""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""Label free""]","CE2, embryonic development, periventricular heterotopia, cerebral organoids","Raw files were analysed using MaxQuant software (1.6.2.10).

Here, we investigate the RNA binding function of ATRX, a chromatin remodeler with roles in silencing of repetitive regions of the genome and in recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).  We identify ATRX RNA binding regions (RBRs) and discover that the major ATRX RBR lies within the N-terminal region of the protein, distinct from its PHD and helicase domains.  Deletion of this ATRX RBR (ATRXRBR) compromises ATRX interactions with RNAs in vitro and in vivo and alters its chromatin binding properties. Genome-wide studies reveal that loss of RNA interactions results in a redistribution of ATRX on chromatin. Finally, our studies identify a role for ATRX-RNA interactions in regulating PRC2 localization to a subset of polycomb target genes.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]",,,"[""Orbitrap Fusion"",""LTQ Orbitrap Elite""]",,"[""Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]","[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]",RBRID; RNA-protein interactions; RNA-binding,"DDA raw files were processed through the MaxQuant program (Cox and Mann, 2008).

They are involved in complex interactions regulating organelle and cellular metabolism. We have recently reported about the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the three VDAC isoforms purified from rat liver mitochondria (rVDACs), showing for the first time the over-oxidation of the cysteine residues as an exclusive feature of VDACs. Noteworthy, this peculiar PTM is not detectable in other integral membrane mitochondrial proteins, as defined by their elution at low salt concentration by a hydroxyapatite column. In this study, the association of tryptic and chymotryptic proteolysis with UHPLC/High Resolution nESI-MS/MS, allowed us to extend the investigation to the human VDACs. Over-oxidation of the cysteine residues, essentially irreversible in cell conditions, was as certained also in VDAC isoforms from human cells. In human VDAC2 and 3 isoforms the permanently reduced state of a cluster of close cysteines indicates the possibility that disulfide bridges are formed in the proteins. Importantly, the detailed oxidative PTMs found in human VDACs confirm and sustain our previous findings in rat tissues, claiming for a predictable characterization that has to be conveyed in the functional role of VDAC proteins within the cell.","[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]","[""cell culture""]",,"[""Orbitrap Fusion""]",,"[""Shotgun proteomics""]",,Cysteine over-oxidation; mitochondria; Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid; hydroxyapatite; mitochondrial intermembrane space; outer mitochondrial membrane; post-translational modification,"Database Search and protein identification LC–MS/MS data were processed by PEAKS software v. 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada).
