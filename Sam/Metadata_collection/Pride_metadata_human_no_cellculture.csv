Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

Two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) Isolated EVs obtained from activated and apoptozing T-lymphocytes (three normal healthy donors) were lysed in THC buffer supplemented with 1µg/ml Aprotonin, Leupeptin, Pepstatin and 200mM PMSF (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Lysates were sonicated (program: 1s pulse and 5s pulse off, 3min, amplitude: 90%) two times at 4°C and centrifuged at 20’000rpm for 15min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred into a new microfuge tube and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Afterwards each probe was divided into three parts with equal protein amounts of 5µg. Each part was labeled with a specific dye for DIGE preparations (CYDYE DIGE Fluor CY3/CY5, VWR, Darmstadt, Germany). An internal standard was generated through mixing 5µg protein of each probe and labeling with CY2 (CYDYE DIGE Fluor, VWR, Darmstadt, Germany). After labeling, probes were loaded onto pH stripes (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) for the protein separation in the first dimension (isoelectric point). Then proteins were separated in the second dimension (molecular weight, standard SDS-PAGE). The experiments were performed in triplicates. Including the standards, 36 gels were obtained. To identify protein spots, 2D-gels were scanned (IPGphor3, GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) and analyzed by a DIGE DeCyder machine and software (V7.0). 6. Mass spectrometry After the analysis by the DIGE DeCyder machine and software (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) we selected 24 protein spots, for identification of the proteins by mass spectrometry. Selected protein spots were picked out of the SDS-gels using an Ettan spot picker (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) and analyzed by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Mass spectrometry was performed at the Core Facility for Mass Spectrometry in the ZMBH in Heidelberg. Samples were reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin. Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces, concentrated in a speedVac vacuum centrifuge and diluted to a total volume of 30ul with 0.1% TFA. 25ul of the sample was analyzed by a nanoHPLC system (nanoAcquity, Waters) coupled to an ESI LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Sample was loaded on a C18 trapping column and separated on an analytical column (75um x 250mm) with a flow rate of 300nl/min in an acetonitrile-gradient (3%-40% ). One survey scan (res: 60000) was followed by 5 information dependent product ion scans in the ion trap. MS/MS spectra were searched against the Swissprot database (20282 entries) using the Mascot software (Matrix Science). Trypsin was specified as enzyme. Carbamidomethyl was set as fixed modification of cysteine and oxidation (methionine), deamidation (asparagines, glutamine), N-terminal acetylation and phosphorylation (serine, Threonine) as variable modifications. Mass tolerance was set to 10ppm and 0.5 Da for MS and MS/MS, respectively.	2018-02-28	"[[""DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2018.00534"",""PMID:29599781""]]"

CCPs are deglutamylating enzymes, able to catalyze the shortening of polyglutamate side-chains and the gene-encoded C-termini of tubulin, telokin and myosin light chain kinase. The functions of these enzymes are not entirely understood, in part due to lack of information about C-terminal protein processing in the cell and its functional implications. By means of C-terminal COFRADIC, a positional proteomics approach, we searched for cellular substrates targets of CCP1, the most relevant member of this family. We here identified 7 new putative CCP1 protein substrates, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors and high mobility group proteins. 	"[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]"	"[""HEK-293FT cell""]"	"[{""ptm"":""L-methionine (S)-sulfoxide"",""UNIMOD"":""39#C""},{""ptm"":""4x(2)H labeled alpha-dimethylamino N-terminal residue"",""UNIMOD"":""199#N-term""},{""ptm"":""3x(2)H labeled N6-acetyl-L-lysine"",""UNIMOD"":""56#K""},{""ptm"":""2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (Gln)"",""UNIMOD"":""28#Q""},{""ptm"":""N-acetylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""188""},{""ptm"":""acetate labeling reagent (N-term) (heavy form, +3amu)""}]"	"[""LTQ Orbitrap Velos""]"	"[""PRIME-XS Project"",""Biological""]"	"[""Bottom-up proteomics""]"		degradomics C-terminomics carboxypeptidase	LC-MS/MS analysis of 2 μL of the sample mixtures was performed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano LC system (Dionex) in-line connected to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher). Full scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at a target value of 1E6 with a resolution of 60,000. The ten most intense ions were then isolated for fragmentation in the linear ion trap, with a dynamic exclusion of 20 s. Peptides were fragmented after filling the ion trap at a target value of 1E4 ion counts. From the MS/MS data in each LC run, Mascot Generic Files were created using the Mascot Distiller software (version 2.3.2.0, Matrix Science). The generated MS/MS peak lists were then searched (2011_05 UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database containing 20,286 human entries). The following search parameters were set: spectra were searched with semi-ArgC/P enzyme settings, allowing no missed cleavages. Mass tolerance on the precursor ion was set to 10 ppm and on fragment ions to 0.5 Da. In addition, Mascot’s C13 setting was set to 1. The peptide charge was set to 1+, 2+ or 3+ and instrument setting was put on ESI-TRAP.. For the identification of butyrylated peptides, variable modifications were set to pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine and fixed modifications included D3-acetylation at lysines, methionine oxidation to methionine-sulfoxide and butyrylation (12C4 or 13C4) of peptide N-termini. Only peptides that were ranked one and scored above the threshold score, set at 95% confidence, were withheld.	2014-03-17	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:25381060""]]"

Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not in HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80% convergence of protein identifications, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem affect the extent of protein regulation. For example, while a clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon arsenic treatment, such an effect was lacking in HCT116 cells and the latter express drastically higher levels of the involved redox proteins. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anticancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537) by means of functional groups of proteins and mapped their effects according to DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. We were able to characterize the global effects of these metallodrugs on the proteome and generate hypotheses on hitherto unrecognized mechanisms. Significant differences in the two colon cell lines strongly suggest that knowledge of mechanistic hallmarks of anticancer metallodrug action are imperative for the design of clinical studies and that outcome may be enhanced by means of patient stratification strategies according to these hallmarks.

Samples were isolated by the biotin switch  and streptavidin pulldown before being analyzed by MS/MS on an Orbitrap instrument. Database Searching and bioinformatics: Tandem mass spectra were extracted; charge state deconvolution and deisotoping were not performed. All MS/MS samples were analyzed using Sequest (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, version v.27, rev. 11). Sequest was initiated to search the database containing ipi.HUMAN.v3.87, the Global Proteome Machine cRAP v.2012.01.01, and random decoy sequences (183158 entries) assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin. Sequest was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.00 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 10 ppm. Oxidation of methionine, iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine, and n-ethylmaleimide on cysteine were specified in Sequest as variable modifications. Criteria for Protein Identification-PROTEOIQ (V2.6, www.nusep.com) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptides were parsed before analysis with a minimum Xcorr value of 1.5 and a minimum length of 6 amino acids. There were no matches to the concatenated decoy database and therefore a false discovery value is not applicable or ""0"". Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least two identified peptides with 5 spectra per peptide. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony."

Tyrosine nitration is a unique type of post translational modification that occurs in the setting of inflammation and nitrosative stress. To date, the significance and functional implications of tyrosine nitration of complement factor H (CFH), a key complement regulator in the eye has not been explored, and is examined in this study in the context of AMD pathogenesis. Sections of eyes from deceased individuals with AMD (n = 5) demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive nitrotyrosine CFH. We purified nitrated CFH from retinae from 2 AMD patients. Mass spectrometry of CFH isolated from AMD eyes revealed residues in domains critical for binding to heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), lipid peroxidation by-products and complement (C) 3b were nitrated. Functional studies revealed that nitrated CFH did not bind to lipid peroxidation products, nor to the GAG of perlecan nor to C3b. There was loss of cofactor activity for Factor I mediated cleavage of C3b with nitrated CFH compared to non-nitrated CFH. CFH inhibits, but nitrated CFH significantly potentiates, the secretion of the pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokine IL-8 from monocytes that have been stimulated with lipid peroxidation by-products. AMD patients (n = 30) and controls (n = 30) were used to measure plasma nitrated CFH using a novel ELISA. AMD patients had significantly elevated nitrated CFH levels compared to controls (p = 0.0117). These findings strongly suggest that nitrated CFH contributes to AMD progression, and is a target for therapeutic intervention.

11	PXD009252	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009252	A mass spectrometry-based predictive strategy reveals ADAP1 is phosphorylated at Tyrosine 364.	Abstract Rationale The goal of this work was to identify phosphorylation sites within the amino acid sequence of human ADAP1. Using traditional mass spectrometry-based techniques we were unable to produce interpretable spectra demonstrating modification by phosphorylation. This prompted us to employ a strategy in which phosphorylated peptides were first predicted using peptide mapping followed by targeted MS/MS acquisition. Methods ADAP1 was immunoprecipitated from extracts of HEK293 cells stably-transfected with ADAP1 cDNA. Immunoprecipitated ADAP1 was digested with proteolytic enzymes and analyzed by LC-MS in MS1 mode by high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS). Peptide molecular features were extracted using an untargeted data mining algorithm. Extracted peptide neutral masses were matched against the ADAP1 amino acid sequence with phosphorylation included as a predicted modification. Peptides with predicted phosphorylation sites were analyzed by targeted LC-MS2. Acquired MS2 spectra were then analyzed using database search engines to confirm phosphorylation. Spectra of phosphorylated peptides were validated by manual interpretation. Further confirmation was performed by manipulating phospho-peptide abundance using calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) and the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Results Of five predicted phosphopeptides, one, comprised of the sequence AVDRPMLPQEYAVEAHFK, was confirmed to be phosphorylated on a Tyrosine at position 364. Pre-treatment of cells with PMA prior to immunoprecipitation increased the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide as determined by area counts of extracted ion chromatograms (EIC). Addition of CIP to immunoprecipitation reactions eliminated the phosphorylated form.  Conclusions A novel phosphorylation site was identified at Tyrosine 364. Phosphorylation at this site is increased by treatment with PMA. PMA promotes membrane translocation and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), indicating that Tyrosine 364 is phosphorylated by a PKC-dependent mechanism.

The following extraction parameters were used: minimum ion peak height = 1000 counts, ion count threshold = 2 or more ions, allowed ion species = +H and +Na, charge state maximum = 4, chromatographic peak height 3,000 counts, and isotope model = peptide. Peptide sequence matching was performed in BioConfirm software (Agilent Technologies).  Extracted peptide neutral masses were matched against in silico digested ADAP1 amino acid sequence with phosphorylation included as a predicted modification. A match mass error of 10 ppm was allowed. For all matched peptides, m/z and retention time for all detected charge states were exported in a targeted MS/MS inclusion list for targeted MS/MS data acquisition. Database searching. Raw data were extracted and analyzed using Spectrum Mill (Rev A.03.03.038 SR1, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Peak picking was performed within Spectrum Mill using the following parameters: signal-to-noise = 25:1, maximum charge state = 5, and precursors MH+ = 600-6000 Da. For searches the following parameters were applied: Swiss-Prot Human database (release 15.12), carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification, phosphorylation and oxidized methionine as variable modifications, maximum of 1 missed cleavage, precursor mass tolerance +/- 20 ppm, product mass tolerance +/- 40 ppm, sequence tag length > 3, and maximum ambiguous precursor charge = 3. Data were also searched against an in-house database that consisted of the ADAP1 sequence. Data were evaluated and protein identifications were considered significant if the following confidence thresholds were met: minimum of 2 peptides per protein, protein score >20, individual peptide scores > 10, and Scored Percent Intensity (SPI) >70%.	2018-03-19	"[[""DOI:10.1002/rcm.8140"",""PMID:29659066""]]"

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

In summary, pre-concentration of peptides was carried out on a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 100 μm x 2 cm, C18, 5 μm, 100 Å) within 7 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min with 0.1% TFA. Peptides were then transferred onto an analytical column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC, 75 μm x 50 cm, nano Viper, C18, 2 μm, 100 Å). There, peptide separation was achieved with a gradient from 5-40% solvent B over 98 min at 400 nl/min at 60°C (solvent A: 0.1% FA, solvent B: 0.1% FA, 84% acetonitrile). MS/MS spectra were acquired in a data-dependent mode. Full scan mass spectra in the Orbitrap analyzer were acquired in profile mode at a resolution of 60,000 at 400 m/z and within a mass range of 350-2000 m/z. For MS/MS measurements, the twenty most abundant peptide ions were fragmented by CID and measured for tandem mass spectra in the linear ion trap. Protein identification happened via Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The spectra were searched against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (Release 2015_10; 70,075 entries) via Mascot (ver.2.5, Matrix Science). For taxonomy the chosen setting was homo sapiens and for mass tolerance it was 5 ppm for precursor ions and 0.4 Da for fragment ions. Dynamic modifications were considered for methionine (oxidation) and static modifications for cysteine (carbamidomethyl). Calculation of the false discovery rate was performed by Proteome Discoverer’s Percolator function and identifications with an FDR greater than 1 % were rejected. The software Progenesis QI (ver. 2.0.5387.52102, Nonlinear Dynamics) was used for label-free quantification. The obtained .raw files were aligned to a reference run and a master map of common features was applied to all experimental runs for adjustment of retention time differences. Ion charge states of 2+, 3+ and 4+ with minimum three isotope peaks were considered and raw ion abundances were normalized for automatic correction of technical or experimental variations between runs. Quantified features were identified with the obtained Proteome Discoverer identifications. For protein quantification, all non-conflicting peptides were considered. An in-house written R-script was applied to the normalized protein abundances obtained from the software for t-test calculations. Fold changes between groups were determined based on normalized abundances, whereas t-test calculations used arcsinh-transformed data for consistency with the Progenesis QI software. Adjustment of t-test p-values for FDR control happened with the method of Benjamini and Hochberg. Proteins were considered differentially abundant between groups with an absolute fold change ≥ 1.5 and a pFDR≤ 0.05.	2019-08-13	"[[""PMID:30770125"",""DOI:10.1016/j.ajpath.2018.11.018""]]"

The principle of the scanning quadrupole DIA is discussed and the effect of the optimization of analytical instrument characteristics, such as acquisition speed, sample complexity, and scan/integration time in relation to sample complexity for a number of different model proteomes of various complexity and dynamic range, including plasma, human cell lines, and bacteria samples, discussed. In addition, its technological merits from an acquisition neutral perspective are reviewed. The qualitative and semi-quantitative performance of the method is illustrated and contrasted for the analysis of a well-characterised human cell line sample using untargeted and targeted search strategies. The application of the method is demonstrated for the analysis of the calcineurin-dependent proteome of drug treated Aspergillus fumigatus. The design of these experiments afforded assessment of the precision and accuracy of scanning quadrupole data independent acquisition (DIA) method as will be demonstrated by peptide and protein centric analysis of the study pool QC samples of the study. Moreover, novel and specific interactors in response to drug treatment that are indicative of the role of calcineurin role in regulating these effectors have been identified.

Qualitative analysis was performed with Scaffold v4.7.1 (Proteome Software, Portland, OR) or Skyline v3.5 (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) using libraries derived from PQIp and PLGS protein database searches. ISOQuant was applied for the integrated quantitative analysis of data derived from multiple LC-MS runs (http://www.isoquant.net) [35]. Protein and peptides identifications were obtained by searching Homo sapiens UniProt (20,161 reviewed entries, release 2016_10) or Aspergillus fumigates NCBI (9150 RefSeq entries, April 2016) databases. Targeted data analysis/library searches were conducted with development software [36,37] using an in-house developed retention time normalized library representing 25,719 non-modified (variable) peptides (PSM), mapping to 6002 proteins/4994 protein groups, based on the analysis of the HeLa sample using a basic pH multiple fraction concatenation strategy (96 fractions concatenated into 12 samples reanalyzed by acidic pH reversed phase DDA LC-MS) [38,39] of which the qualitative and quantitative results were visualized with open source informatics. The first dimension separation were conducted with I-Class ACQUITY/Fractionation Manager system (Waters Corporation) equipped with a BEH C17 2.1 mm x 100 mm column operated at 0.5 ml/min.

Here, we employ an integrated chemical proteomics and response profiling approach to identify and validate plestatins, based on an organometallic ruthenium(II) scaffold, as selective plectin-targeting agents. Plectin is a giant scaffold protein involved in controlling cytoarchitecture. Subcytotoxic concentrations of plestatins induce drastic morphological phenotypes on the microtubule (MT) network accompanied by a global down-regulation of translational activity. Plestatins possess anti-invasive properties in tumour spheroids and also display tumour-inhibiting effects in vivo after oral administration. The ability of plestatins to alter the MT network via plectin represents a unique mechanism to target MTs and shows promise as an anticancer strategy.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

This study combined nanospray liquid chromatography separation with time of flight mass spectrometry, comprehensive structural libraries and informatics to interrogate milk of three human mothers and the gastric aspirates from their 4–12 day post-partum infants. Milk from the mothers contained almost two hundred distinct peptides, demonstrating enzymatic degradation of milk proteins beginning either during lactation or between milk collection and feeding. In the gastric samples, 649 milk peptides were identified, demonstrating that digestion continues in the infant stomach. The majority of peptides in both the intact milk and gastric samples were derived from β-casein. The numbers of peptides from β-casein, lactoferrin, α-lactalbumin, lactadherin, κ-casein, serum albumin, bile-salt associated lipase and xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase were significantly higher in the gastric samples than the milk samples (p<0.05). Six hundred three peptides were significantly different in abundance between milk and gastric samples (p<0.05). Most of the identified peptides have previously identified biological activity. Gastric proteolysis occurs in the term infant in the first two weeks of life releasing biologically active milk peptides with immunomodulatory, antibacterial, and calcium-binding activity of clinical relevance to the proximal intestinal tract.

Each sample was run in triplicate on the Q-TOF in MS-only mode.  Creation of peptide library. To create a peptide library, these gastric and intact samples for term-delivered infants were run using the same method. Data were exported to Mascot Generic Format (.mgf) and analyzed via the downloadable version of X!Tandem (thegpm.org) against a library of human milk proteins derived from previous human milk proteomes. Briefly, no complete modifications were required, but possible phosphorylations of serine, threonine or tyrosine, deamidation of glutamine or asparagine, and oxidation of methionine or tryptophan were allowed. Error tolerances employed were 20 ppm for precursor masses and 40 ppm for fragment masses.  The results from X!Tandem for all samples were compiled for milk samples and for gastric samples, separately. Peptides with e-values ≤ 0.01 were removed (a 99% confidence level threshold). To isolate only unique peptide sequences, all duplicates of sequence, protein and modifications combined were eliminated with the “remove duplicates” function in Excel. Peptides representing identical amino acid sequences and modifications but modified in different positions were also removed as duplicates. The compiled peptide libraries were then used to make an exclusion list for recursive analysis. Recursive analysis was repeated until the number of new peptides returned for each sample was ≤10. Three rounds of recursive analysis were completed for the milk samples (for a total of four MS/MS runs for each). Five rounds were completed for two of the gastric samples (for a total of six MS/MS runs for each). One gastric sample with retention times repeatedly different than the other two gastric samples was examined alone—and required ten rounds of recursive analysis before the number of new peptides returned was ≤10. Peptides were identified via the above procedure and the results from the recursive analysis were added to the original peptide results. Peptide identification. Compounds were identified from all samples by the “Batch Targeted Feature Extraction” function in Agilent MassHunter Profinder B.06.00. The data were searched against the peptide library based on the molecular formula. One library generated from milk peptide library was used to extract milk sample peptide peak areas and two different libraries were used to extract the gastric peptides (as one sample had consistently different retention times). The milk peptide library could not be applied to the gastric samples because they showed retention time shifts in comparison with the milk peptides, likely due to molecular interactions within the sample matrices. For library searching, the following parameters were employed. The maximum number of matches per formula was 1. Peaks were matched on both mass (within 20 ppm error) and retention time (within 1 min error). A height threshold of 500 ion counts was employed. The charge carrier was protons, and the allowed charge states were 1-7.  The isotope model was “peptides.” Extracted ion chromatogram peaks were smoothed with the Gaussian function and the resulting peaks were integrated via the “agile” algorithm. After compounds were extracted, each peak was manually inspected for peak integration and any incorrect assignments were corrected within the Profinder program.	2014-02-04	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:24699806""]]"

Here we report a novel role for the multifunctional adaptor protein ALG-2-interacting protein X (ALIX) in regulating MS orientation in addition to its well-established role in cytokinesis. We show that ALIX is recruited to the pericentriolar material (PCM) of the centrosomes and promotes correct orientation of the MS in asymmetrically dividing Drosophila stem cells and epithelial cells, and symmetrically dividing Drosophila and human epithelial cells. ALIX-deprived cells display defective formation of astral microtubules (MTs), which results in abnormal MS orientation. Specifically, ALIX is recruited to the PCM via Drosophila Spindle defective 2 (DSpd-2)/Cep192, where ALIX promotes accumulation of g-tubulin and thus facilitates efficient nucleation of astral MTs. In addition, ALIX promotes MT stability by recruiting Microtubule Associated Protein 1S (MAP1S), which stabilizes newly formed MTs. Altogether, our results demonstrate a novel evolutionarily conserved role of ALIX in providing robustness to the orientation of the MS by promoting astral MT formation during asymmetric and symmetric cell division.

Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, and the precursor mass tolerance was set to 1.08 Da (to accommodate incorrect selection of the monoisotopic peak). MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.8 Da. Dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation (Cys), oxidation (Met), deamidation (Asn, Gln) and phosphorylation (Ser, Thr, Tyr). To accurately identify phosphorylation sites, we integrated database search results from both Sequest and Mascot into Scaffold (www.proteomesoftware.com ) and took multiple parameters (SCAFFOLD peptide probability, XCorr, DeltaCN, Mascot ion score, E-value) into consideration. The following limits were used to establish data quality: 80% peptide probability, 10 ppm fragment error, 40 Mascot score, and XCorr for 2+ >2.5, XCorr for 3+ >3, and DeltaCN >0.1. Peptides could be identified by either database search alone as long as the quality metrics were met. Finally, phosphorylation site assignment was manually validated from the raw data.  To quantify the perturbation of pTyr proteome change response to ALK TKI treatment, the integrated peak areas for each pTyr peptide were calculated from extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) using QuanBrowser from Xcalibur 2.0. These values were restricted by m/z (+/-0.02) and retention time (60 s). Other parameters were Genesis peak integration using 9 point smotting, S/N threshold 0.5, and genesis peak detection minimum peak height (S/N) 3.0. The masses and isotopic peak patterns of the target peptides were manually inspected to ensure proper sequence assignment and to verify peak quality. Peak area values of all precursors from all samples were merged to one spreadsheet using PeakAreaSummary software, which was developed in-house (available at http://proteome.moffitt.org/proteomics/). PeakAreaSummary is an Excel add-in using VBA. It first calculates the sum of peak areas for all the precursors in the same sample with the same m/z and retention time (using the same delta values as mentioned above) and then merges the peak area values from all the samples to get one value for any precursor.	2016-09-12	"[[""DOI:10.1126/scisignal.aaf5011"",""PMID:27811184""]]"

Protein N-terminal acetylation and pyroglutamate formation from glutamine were searched as variable modifications for all files. Furthermore, ubiquitylation of lysines and N-termini was searched as variable modifications for all experiments; for trypsin digested peptides this was done in the form of GG-remnants on lysine as well as N-termini, whereas for LysC-digested peptides ubiquitylation was searched as ESTLHLVLRLRGG-remnants on lysine and N-termini. The following extra variable modifications were also considered: deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues. In addition, conjugation of ISG15 (ISGylation) and Nedd8 to lysine residues were searched as additional modifications  to LysC-digested peptides.

However, the physiological effects of statins are diverse and not all are related to LDL-C lowering. We performed a small clinical pilot study to assess the impact of statins on lipoprotein-associated proteins in healthy individuals (n=10) with normal LDL-C (<130 mg/dL), who were treated with rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) for 28 days. Proteomic analysis of size-exclusion chromatography isolated LDL, HDL-L (large) and HDL-S (small) fractions and spectral counting was used to compare relative protein detection before and after statin therapy. Significant protein changes were found in each lipoprotein pool and included both increases and decreases in several proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism, complement regulation and acute phase response. The most dramatic effect of the rosuvastatin treatment was an increase in alpha-1-antirypsin (A1AT) spectral counts associated with HDL-L particles. Quantitative measurement by ELISA confirmed an average 5.7-fold increase in HDL-L associated A1AT. Molecular modeling predictions indicated that the hydrophobic reactive center loop of A1AT, the functional domain responsible for its protease inhibitor activity, is likely involved in its lipid binding and its association with HDL was found to protect A1AT against oxidative inactivation. Cell culture experiments, using J774 macrophages, demonstrated that the association of A1AT with HDL enhances its anti-protease activity, preventing elastase induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha. In conclusion, we show that statins can significantly alter the protein composition of both LDL and HDL and our studies reveal a novel functional relationship between A1AT and HDL. The upregulation of A1AT on HDL enhances its anti-inflammatory functionality, which may contribute to the non-lipid lowering beneficial effects of statins.

31	PXD004626	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD004626	Multi-omics analysis of serum samples demonstrates reprogramming of organ functions via systemic calcium mobilization and platelet activation in metastatic melanoma patients - proteins from serum samples of healthy donors	Pathophysiology of cancer-associated syndroms such as cachexia is poorly understood and no routine biomarkers have been established, yet. Using shotgun proteomics, known marker molecules including PMEL, CRP, SAA and CSPG4 were found deregulated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Targeted analysis of 58 selected proteins with multiple reaction monitoring was applied for independent data verification. In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.

34	PXD009310	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009310	The platelet releasate in healthy population and pregancy	Upon activation, platelets release a multitude of soluble and vesicular signals, collectively termed the ‘platelet releasate’ (PR). This PR plays an important role in haemostasis, wound healing and the inflammatory response. We and others have used qualitative/quantitative proteomic approaches to characterise the PR; however, with reports of marked inter-individual variability, confident and reliable insights have been hindered. Here we aimed to provide a reproducible and quantifiable proteomic analysis and establish a 'core' human PR, as well as to assess its variability in healthy human pregnancy where increased platelet activation is observed. 896 proteins from thrombin-induced PRs were quantified across 32healthy donors, with 277 proteins forming a ‘core’ PR with low variability. All 277 core PR proteins were identified in pregnancy. Furthermore 69 proteins were found differentially released from platelets in healthy human pregnancy. In summary, the PR comprises a ‘core’ set of proteins between healthy individuals. This dynamic proteome significantly changes in physiologic and pathologic conditions. Thus, the PR is a barcode for the health status of an individual at a given time.

In the main Andromeda search precursor mass and fragment mass had an initial mass tolerance of 6ppm and 20ppm, respectively. The search included fixed modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

While the typical methods for the determination of biologically relevant but low-abundant molecular species still relies on the use of specific antibodies, mass spectrometry-based methods are now gaining sufficient sensitivity to cope with such challenges. In the current study we have identified several cytokines and chemokines which were induced by inflammatory activation of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Based on the high-resolution mass spectrometry data obtained with a Q Exactive orbitrap, we built an MRM method to quantify the most relevant molecules selected from the screening experiment. Using nano-flow Chip-HPLC coupled to a 6490 triple-quadrupole MS for MRM analyses we achieved calibration curves covering a linear range of four orders of magnitude and detection limits in the low attomol per microliter concentration range. Carryover was consistently less than 0.005%, the accuracy between 80% and 120% and the median coefficient of variation for LC/MS was only 2.2%. When including the variance introduced by biological replicates and the digestion procedure, the coefficient of variation was less than 20% for most peptides. Selection of appropriate marker molecules allowed us to monitor typical cell culture variations such as different cell densities, proliferative states and the occurrence of cell death. As a result, here we present a robust and efficient MRM-based assay for the accurate and sensitive determination of cytokines and chemokines representative for functional cell states and including comprehensive quality controls.

Besides, it is difficult to integrate it with most quantitative MS-based workflows, except for stable isotopic labelling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). This work describes a fast, flexible and quantitative workflow for the discovery of novel proteinprotein interactions. A cleavable cross-linker, dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] (DSP), is utilized to stabilize protein complexes before immunoprecipitation. Protein complex detachment from the antibody is achieved by limited proteolysis. Finally, protein quantitation is performed via 18O labelling. The workflow has been optimized concerning: (i) DSP concentration and (ii) incubation times for limited proteolysis, using the stem cell-associated transcription co-factor ZNF521 as a model target. The interaction of ZNF521 with the core components of the nuclear remodelling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, already reported in the literature, was confirmed. Additionally, interactions with newly discovered molecular partners of potentially relevant functional role, such as ZNF423, Spt16, Spt5, were discovered and validated by Western blotting.

The following search parameters were used: MS tolerance 15 ppm; MS/MS tolerance 0.02 Da; fixed modifications carbamidomethyl cysteine; enzyme trypsin; max. missed cleavages 1; variable modifications: oxidised methionine, C-terminal 18O labelling. Peptide identifications were validated by Percolator,36 integrated in Proteome Discoverer. Percolator qvalue was set to equal or less than 0.05. Nevertheless, only proteins identified with at least one peptide having a q-value equal or less than 0.01 were considered for further analysis (but for quantification, peptides with a q-value between 0.01 and 0.05 were also utilized). For label-free experiments (optimization of DSP concentration and optimization of on-beads digestion), quantification at the peptide level was achieved within Proteome Discoverer by using the event detector (mass precision 2 ppm) and precursor ion area detector modules to calculate peptide peak areas. The sum of all peptide peak areas assigned to ZNF521 or any other protein was used as a semi-quantitative measure of protein abundance. For the final experiment (discovery of novel ZNF521 interactors), based on 18O labelling, quantification was achieved within Proteome Discoverer by using the event detector (mass precision 2 ppm) and precursor ion area quantifier (full 18O labelling) modules to calculate peptide “heavy:light” (H:L) ratios. Protein H:L ratios were calculated by taking the median value of all peptide H:L ratios assigned to a specific protein hit.	2014-12-15	"[[""DOI:10.1021/pr501288h"",""PMID:25774781""]]"

To understand Treg identity, we compared by proteomics and transcriptomics human naïve (n) and effector (e)Tregs, Tconvs and transitional FOXP3+ cells. Only 12% of 422 differentially expressed proteins was identified as such at the mRNA level, demonstrating the importance of direct proteome measurement. Fifty-one proteins discriminated Tregs from Tconvs. This common Treg protein signature indicates altered signaling by TCR-, TNF receptor-, NFB-, PI3 kinase/mTOR-, NFAT- and STAT pathways, and unique cell biological and metabolic features. Another protein signature uniquely identified eTregs and revealed active cell division, apoptosis sensitivity and suppression of NFB- and STAT signaling. eTreg fate appears consolidated by FOXP3 outnumbering its partner transcription factors. These features explain why eTregs cannot produce inflammatory cytokines, whereas transitional FOXP3+ cells can. Collectively, our data reveal that Treg identity is defined and protected by uniquely “wired” signaling pathways. Associated GEO dataset is available at GSE90600.

Potential contaminants, proteins only identified by site and reverse hits were eliminated using Perseus version 1.5.1.6. To compare proteomes of different cell populations, LFQ values were log2-transformed and the 3-6 biological replicates per experimental condition grouped. For further analysis, only proteins with 3 valid values in at least one of the groups were included. Missing values were imputed by normal distribution (width= 0.3, shift= 1.8). Intergroup differences in protein levels were calculated using ANOVA using Benjamini-Hochberg FDR of 0.05 and S0 0.4. General relatedness of samples was assessed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Perseus’ built-in tool.

CEP192 is a key factors in the initiation process of centrosome duplication and in the control of centrosome microtubule nucleation. However, regulatory means of CEP192 have remained unknown. Here we report that FBXL13, a binding determinant of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-Box)-family E3 ubiquitin ligases, is enriched at centrosomes and interacts with the centrosomal proteins Centrin-2, Centrin-3, CEP152, and CEP192. Among these, CEP192 is specifically targeted for proteasomal degredation by FBXL13. Accordingly, induced FBXL13 expression downregulates centrosomal γ-tubulin, and disrupts centrosomal microtubule arrays. In addition, depletion of FBXL13 induces high levels of CEP192 and γ-tubulin at the centrosomes corresponding to defects in cell motility. Together, we characterize FBXL13 as a novel regulator of microtubule nucleation activity and highlight a role in promoting cell motility with potential tumor-promoting implications.

The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed proteins in the uterosacral ligaments of women with and without pelvic organ prolapse and analyze their relationships to cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of pelvic organ prolapse.   Experimental Design:  Uterosacral ligament connective tissue from four patients with pelvic organ prolapse and four control women underwent iTRAQ analysis followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of differentially expressed proteins.  Differentially expressed proteins were valideated using western blot analysis.   Results:  A total of 1789 unique protein sequences were identified in the uterosacral ligament connective tissues.  88 proteins had expression levels that were significantly different between prolapse and control groups (≥1.2-fold). Ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrated 14 differentially expressed proteins that were associated with ""Connective Tissue Function"". Among them, fibromodulin(FMOD), Collagen alpha-1 (XIV) chain(COL14A1), Calponin-1 (CNN-1), Tenascin (TNC), and Galectin-1(LGALS1 appeared most likely to play a role in the etiology of pelvic organ prolapse.  Conclusions and clinical relevence:  We identified at least 6 proteins not previously associated with the pathogenesis of pelvic organ prolapse with biologic functions that suggest a plausible relationship to the disorder.

Urine is a rich source of polypeptides and protein degradation products, which have been filtered from blood plasma, thus urine has strong potential as a source for novel clinical diagnostics in disease. In this study, we examine the urinary peptidome from normal healthy women during pregnancy, to demonstrate that peptides are readily observed. We utilise the dissociation method, electron transfer dissociation (ETD) to increase the identification rate of the peptides present within these samples, as the polypeptide species observed in these samples are large and highly charged. An increase in the number of peptides whose identities could be ascribed using routine database searching methods was enabled via the use of ETD.

Here, we report that downregulation of SIRT2 and upregulation of SIRT1 is a molecular signature of primed hPSCs and that SIRT2 critically regulates metabolic reprogramming during induced pluripotency by targeting glycolytic enzymes including aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase. Remarkably, knockdown of SIRT2 in human fibroblasts resulted in significantly decreased OXPHOS and increased glycolysis. In addition, we found that miR-200c-5p specifically targets SIRT2, downregulating its expression. Furthermore, SIRT2 overexpression in hPSCs significantly affected energy metabolism, altering stem cell functions such as pluripotent differentiation properties. Taken together, our results identify the miR-200c-SIRT2 axis as a key regulator of metabolic reprogramming (Warburg-like effect), via regulation of glycolytic enzymes, during human induced pluripotency and pluripotent stem cell function. To address our hypothesis that acetylation affects the metabolic switch, we compared protein acetylation in hESCs and hDFs by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/ MS) analyses following immunoprecipitation with acetyl-Lys antibody.

49	PXD010787	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010787	Project Name: Functional proteomics of midostaurin in lung cancer cells: Chemical Proteomics	Lung cancer is associated with high prevalence and mortality, and despite significant successes with targeted drugs in genomically defined subsets of lung cancer and immunotherapy, the majority of patients currently does not benefit from these therapies. Through a targeted drug screen, we found the recently approved multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin to have potent activity in several lung cancer cells independent of its intended target, PKC, or a specific genomic marker. To determine the underlying mechanism of action we applied a layered functional proteomics approach and a new data integration method. Using chemical proteomics, we identified multiple midostaurin kinase targets in these cells. Network-based integration of these targets with quantitative tyrosine and global phosphoproteomics data using protein-protein interactions from the STRING database suggested multiple targets are relevant for the mode of action of midostaurin. Subsequent functional validation using RNA interference and selective small molecule probes showed that simultaneous inhibition of TBK1, PDK1 and AURKA was required to elicit midostaurin’s cellular effects. Immunoblot analysis of downstream signaling nodes showed that combined inhibition of these targets altered PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathways that in part converged on PLK1. Furthermore, rational combination of midostaurin with the more potent PLK1 inhibitor BI2536, which is in advanced clinical trials, elicited strong synergy. Our results demonstrate that combination of complementary functional proteomics approaches and subsequent network-based data integration can reveal novel insight into the complex mode of action of multi-kinase inhibitors, actionable targets for drug discovery and cancer vulnerabilities. Finally, we illustrate how this knowledge can be utilized for the rational design of synergistic drug combinations with high potential for clinical translation.

Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not in HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80% convergence of protein identifications, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem affect the extent of protein regulation. For example, while a clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon arsenic treatment, such an effect was lacking in HCT116 cells and the latter express drastically higher levels of the involved redox proteins. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anticancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537) by means of functional groups of proteins and mapped their effects according to DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. We were able to characterize the global effects of these metallodrugs on the proteome and generate hypotheses on hitherto unrecognized mechanisms. Significant differences in the two colon cell lines strongly suggest that knowledge of mechanistic hallmarks of anticancer metallodrug action are imperative for the design of clinical studies and that outcome may be enhanced by means of patient stratification strategies according to these hallmarks.

In the United States, approximately 12% of all births are preterm.1 Despite decades of research, there has been little progress in developing effective interventions to prevent preterm birth. In fact, the rate of preterm birth has increased slightly over the last several decades.2 The ultimate goal of the Genomic and Proteomic Network for Preterm Birth Research (GPN-PBR) is to identify possible biomarkers that could predict the susceptibility to spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) as well as to shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in its etiologies. Understanding those mechanisms will help us predict SPTB and may facilitate the introduction of more effective prevention and treatment strategies.

The MS/MS spectra were searched against an indexed human RefSeq database (version updated November 2007; 33,439 entries) with TurboSEQUEST (version 27.12; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Mascot (version 2.2.03; Matrix Science, Boston, MA).

The SEQUEST (Thermo Scientific) and Mascot (Matrix Science) output files were integrated into Scaffold (version 2.01; Proteome Software, Portland, OR) for validating MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Assignment of peptide sequences was performed using the PeptideProphet algorithm.17 PeptideProphet accounts for the distribution of scores over an entire data set to calculate the probability of a correct assignment for every peptide. PeptideProphet calculates false-positive error rates at specific probability score cutoff values for each data set.18 A minimum PeptideProphet probability score of ≥0.5 was used to remove low probability peptides. At this cutoff, the estimated false-positive error rate was 10.8%. Protein identifications were accepted with a minimum ProteinProphet probability score of ≥0.8 and at least 2 identified unique peptides.19 For this dataset, a ProteinProphet probability score of ≥0.8 corresponded to a false-positive error rate of 4%. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.	2014-08-26	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.ajog.2014.06.035"",""PMID:24954659""]]"

69	PXD001353	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001353	Truncated Tau -  Role of the Tau N-terminal region in microtubule stabilization revealed by new endogenous truncated forms	Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that ensures neuronal shape and function. Besides, Tau is a central player in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related Tauopathies where it is found aggregated in degenerating neurons. Mechanisms leading to Tau pathology and its progression are far from being elucidated. Among Tau species found in AD brains, several yet unidentified truncated Tau fragments are showed. A major step forward in the understanding of the role of Tau truncation would be to identify the precise cleavage sites of Tau species. This key step is mandatory to generate appropriate experimental tools in order to investigate the impact of each identified truncated-species on Tau function/dysfunction. Here, we achieved an optimized proteomics approach and succeed in identifying a number of new N-terminally truncated-Tau species from human brain. As N-terminal residues of these fragments are located broadly across Tau sequence, one could expect to have different effects on Tau. We initiated cell-based functional studies by analyzing biochemical characteristics of two N-terminally truncated Tau species starting at residues Met11 and Gln124 (accordingly to the longest Tau isoform) regarding Tau microtubule function. Our results surprisingly showed that the ability of Tau to bind and stabilize microtubules was greater when the first 123 residues are truncated, suggesting that Tau N-terminus would have a role in regulation of microtubule stabilization. Overall, future studies based on our new N-terminally truncated-Tau species will provide new knowledge on the role of truncation in Tau biology as well as in AD pathological process.

Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not in HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80% convergence of protein identifications, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem affect the extent of protein regulation. For example, while a clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon arsenic treatment, such an effect was lacking in HCT116 cells and the latter express drastically higher levels of the involved redox proteins. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anticancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537) by means of functional groups of proteins and mapped their effects according to DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. We were able to characterize the global effects of these metallodrugs on the proteome and generate hypotheses on hitherto unrecognized mechanisms. Significant differences in the two colon cell lines strongly suggest that knowledge of mechanistic hallmarks of anticancer metallodrug action are imperative for the design of clinical studies and that outcome may be enhanced by means of patient stratification strategies according to these hallmarks.

Sample collection included blood and urine at baseline (control and DN-basal) and, in DN patients, after 3 months of losartan treatment (DN-treated).  Urinary proteome analysis identified 166 differentially abundant proteins between controls and DN patients, 27 comparing DN-treated and DN-basal patients, and 182 between DN-treated patients and controls. Mathematical modeling analysis identified 80 key proteins involved in DN pathophysiology, 15 in losartan effect and 7 of these 95 are essential in both processes. VCAM-1 and neprilysin are the only ones that are differentially expressed in the urinary proteome. We observed an increase of VCAM-1 urine levels in DN-basal patients compared to diabetic controls and an increase of urinary neprilysin in DN-treated patients with persistent albuminuria, the latter confirmed by ELISA .

Increased expression of USP9X is observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is correlated with poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanism for USP9X regulating tumor cell survival and tumorigenesis in NSCLC is less defined. In this study, chemical labeling quantitative proteomic screening was applied to analyze A549 cells with or without USP9X RNA interference, and the resulting data suggested that TTK is a potential substrate of USP9X. Further experimental evidences confirmed that USP9X stabilized TTK via direct interaction and deubiquitination of TTK. Moreover, knockdown of USP9X or TTK inhibited cell proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis, and the immunohistochemical analysis of clinical NSCLC samples showed that the protein expression levels of USP9X and TTK were significantly elevated and positively correlated in tumor tissues. In summary, our data demonstrated that the USP9X-TTK axis may play a critical role in NSCLC, and could be considered as the potential therapeutic target.

We found the majority of MPs were distributed in low molecular weight (LMW) ranges, especially in 0-40 kDa. The identification of LMW proteins is challenging owing to their low length, low abundancy, and hydrophobicity. Even worse, many sequences from Trypsin digestion are unlikely to yield detectable peptides or composed less number of observable peptides in MS detection. Therefore, we focused on small MPs by combining LMW protein enrichment and mirror-protease strategy on human testis samples. The in-depth testis LMW protein profiling documented 4,063 proteins from which 2,565 proteins were belong to LMW proteins and 1,130 proteins had mirror peptides. This provided mass spectral evidence for small MPs further verification, and two MPs were verified in seven identified MPs. For Q8N688, confident peptides were verified from Trypsin and LysargiNase digestions, and continuous b/y-ion peptide was obtained by mirror-spectrum matching. Two verified peptides of Q86WR6 were from gel-separation and gel-elution dataset, respectively. And the other 5 MPs cannot be distinguished sufficiently as PE1, but need more verification information.

We improved the precision and accuracy of peptide-ion intensity based quantification in order to enable accurate determination of protein turnover in non-dividing cells using dynamic-SILAC. This enabled precise and accurate protein half-life determination ranging from 10 to more than 1000 hours. We achieve good proteomic coverage ranging from four to six thousand proteins in several types of non-dividing cells, corresponding to a total of 9699 unique proteins over the entire dataset. Good agreement was observed in half-lives between B-cells, natural killer cells and monocytes, while hepatocytes and mouse embryonic neurons showed substantial differences.  Our comprehensive dataset enabled extension and statistical validation of the previous observation that subunits of protein complexes tend to have coherent turnover. Furthermore, we observed complex architecture dependent turnover within complexes of the proteasome and the nuclear pore complex.

The proliferation of these LMW peptides coincides with the earliest stages of cataract formation, suggesting that the protein cleavages involved may contribute to the aggregation and insolubilisation of crystallins – these being hall marks of cataractogenesis. This study reports the identification of 238 endogenous LMW crystallin peptides from the cortical extracts of human lenses aged 16, 44, 75 and 83 years. Analysis of the peptide terminal amino acids showed that Lys and Arg were situated at the C-terminus with significantly higher frequency compared to other residues, suggesting that trypsin-like proteolysis may be active in the lens cortical fibre cells. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) analysis of a prominent αA-crystallin peptide (αA57-65) showed that the concentration of this peptide in the human lens increased gradually to middle age, after which the rate of αA57-65 formation escalated significantly. Using 2-D gel electrophoresis and nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS, 13 protein complexes of 40-150 kDa consisting of multiple crystallin components were characterised from the water soluble cortical extracts of an adult human lens. The detection of these protein complexes suggested the possibility of crystallin cross-linking, with these complexes potentially acting to stabilise degraded crystallins by sequestration into water soluble complexes.

Understanding mechanisms of resistance and identifying effective therapeutic alternatives is one of the most important scientific challenges in melanoma. Using proteomics, we want to specifically gain insight into the pathophysiological process of cerebral metastases. Methods Cerebral metastases from melanoma patients were prepared for MS analysis by tryptic digestion. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a QExactive HF hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer, equipped with a nanospray ion source, coupled with a nano HPLC system.  Results In this pilot study, we were able to identify 5,977 proteins by LC-MS analysis. Samples were classified into good and poor responders based on PFS. By evaluating these proteomic profiles according to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG pathways and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we could characterize differences between the two distinct groups. We further detected an EMT signature, V-type proton ATPases, calcium ion binding proteins, eukaryotic translation initiation factors, cell adhesion proteins and several transporter and exchanger proteins to be significantly up-regulated in poor responding patients, whereas good responders showed an immune-activation and involvement of extracellular matrix structural constituents, among other features. Subsequently we identified the most class-discriminating proteins based on nearest shrunken centroids. Conclusions Using proteomics helped to identify already known extra-cerebral resistance mechanisms in the cerebral metastases and further discovered possible brain specific mechanisms of drug efflux, which might serve as interesting targets, especially for treatment of these types of metastases or as predictive marker.

Neuromelanin pigment is stored in granules including a protein matrix and lipid droplets. Neuromelanin granules are yet only partially characterised regarding their structure and function. To clarify the exact function of neuromelanin granules in humans, their enrichment and in-depth characterization from human substantia nigra is necessary. Previously published global proteome studies of neuromelanin granules in human substantia nigra required high tissue amounts. Due to the limited availability of human brain tissue we established a new method based on laser microdissection combined with mass spectrometry for the isolation and analysis of neuromelanin granules. With this method it is possible for the first time to isolate a sufficient amount of neuromelanin granules for global proteomics analysis from ten 10 µm tissue sections. In total 1,000 proteins were identified associated with neuromelanin granules. More than 68% of those proteins were also identified in previously performed studies. Our results confirm and further extend previously described findings, supporting the connection of neuromelanin granules to iron homeostasis and lysosomes, respectively endosomes. Hence, this method is suitable for the donor specific enrichment and proteomic analysis of neuromelanin granules.

However, the relationships between the AS and classic oncogenes/tumor suppressors are largely unknown. Here we show that the deletion of tumor suppressor PTEN alters pre-mRNA splicing in its phosphatase-independent manner, and identify262 PTEN-regulated AS events in 293T cells by RNA sequencing, which are associated with significant worse outcome of cancer patients. Based on these findings, we report that nuclear PTEN interacts with the splicing machinery, spliceosome, to regulate its assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. Especially, the exon-2b exclusion of GOLGA2 contributes to PTEN knockdown-induced tumorigenesis by promoting dramatic Golgi extension and secretion, and PTEN depletion significantly sensitizes cancer cells to secretion inhibitors, Brefeldin A and Golgicide A. Given that many cancers lack PTEN expression, our results suggest that Golgi secretion inhibitors alone or in combination with PI3K/Akt kinase inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for PTEN-deficient cancers.

The aim of this study was to identify the serum proteomic profile in patients with SUI and to replicate findings from a preceding study in which a significant difference in the urinary proteome was identified.  Serum samples were collected from 38 patients (19 SUI; 19 matched, continent controls). Sample preparation included serum albumin depletion, in-solution enzymatic digestion of proteins applying a combination of Gluc-C and trypsin and peptide separation using nano High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Label-free quantitation of peptides and proteins was performed after triplicate measurements using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peptide identification was achieved by searching the Human SwissProt Database using Mascot and X!Tandem. Main outcome measure was the relative abundance of each detected protein in serum.

Data search was performed using Mascot v. 2.51 (http://www.matrixscience.com/). For the database search trypsin and Glu-C were selected as enzymes with carbamidomethyl on Cys as fixed modification and oxidation on Met, phosphorylation on Ser, Thr,  and Tyr as variable modifications. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 50 ppm, MS/MS tolerance to 0.05 Da, and the search was performed in a decoy database with a false discovery rate set to 1%. The ion-score cut-off in Mascot was set to 15 and two peptides per protein were required for automatic detection.  The main outcome measure was the relative concentration of identified proteins in serum. Protein abundance was estimated by using peptide counts normalized to counts per million (cpm). Log2-fold change was estimated based on variance stabilized average log2 cpm values using the package edgeR. Resulting p values were corrected for multiple testing according to Storey et al. A q value of <0.25 was considered statistically significant. Proteins were defined as “not detected” if they were present in <20% of samples per group. Proteins were defined as “detected” if they were present in >80% of the samples. If proteins were detected in SUI but not detected in controls, they were declared as “induced”. If proteins were detected in controls, but not in SUI samples, they were declared as “depleted”.

Abnormal vitreous traction is involved in the formation of macular holes. Both glial cells and hyalocytes contribute to epiretinal membrane formation in IMH. In order to gain further insight into the pathophysiology of IMH, we conducted a discovery phase investigation of the vitreous proteome in four patients with macular holes and six controls using one-dimensional gel fractionation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. Of a total of 5912 vitreous proteins, 32 proteins had increased and 39 proteins had decreased expression in IMH compared with controls, using a false discovery rate approach with p-value <0.001 and q value <0.05. IMH was associated with increased expression of proteins in the complement pathway, α-2-macroglobulin, a major inducer of Müller glial cell migration, fibrinogen, and extracellular matrix proteins, and decreased expression of proteins involved in protein folding and actin filament binding. A proteomic approach revealed proteins and biological pathways that may be involved in the pathogenesis of IMH and could be targeted for future studies.

Parameters allowed for 2 missed tryptic cleavages, a fragment ion mass error of 1 Da, and potential protein modifications for carbamidomethylation, oxidation, phosphorylation, deamidation, and carbamylation. Peptide identifications were accepted if they were established at >95.0% probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm with Scaffold Δ-mass correction. Protein identifications were accepted if they were established at >99.0% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides (minimum length of 7 amino acids). Protein Prophet algorithm was used to assign protein probabilities using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.5% for peptides and 1% for proteins against the target-decoy database. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters. Scaffold 4 (Proteome Software) was used for FDR filtering and to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. PANTHER analysis was used to classify protein function and to conduct pathway analyses. Relative quantification was performed using weighted spectral counting. Data log (2) transformed values were normalized based on total spectral counts per sample and compared using the tools described below.  Bioinformatics Analysis  An R package, DEGseq15 was used to identify the differentially expressed proteins between samples from IMH and controls. P-values and q-values were calculated using a FDR approach as described by Benjamini16 and Storey.17 An MA plot was used for visualization of proteomic data in significance analyses.18 Using a p-value < 0.001 and a cutoff of q-value < 0.05, 71 differentially expressed proteins were identified.

To enable the in-depth analysis of protein interactions in chromatin-associated protein complexes, we have previously developed a method termed RIME (Rapid Immunoprecipitation Mass spectrometry of Endogenous proteins). Here, we present a quantitative multiplexed method (qPLEX-RIME), which integrates RIME with isobaric labelling and tribrid mass spectrometry for the study of protein interactome dynamics in a quantitative fashion with increased sensitivity. Using the qPLEX-RIME method, we delineated the temporal changes of the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) interactome in breast cancer cells treated with 4-hydrotamoxifen and we successfully identified endogenous ERα-associated proteins in human Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) tumours and in primary human breast cancer clinical tissue.

Checkpoint systems allow the accurate execution of each cell cycle phase.  The precise regulation of the levels of cyclin proteins is fundamental to coordinate cell division with checkpoints, avoiding genome instability.  Cyclin F has important functions in regulating the cell cycle during the G2 checkpoint; however, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of cyclin F are poorly understood.  Here, we observe that cyclin F is regulated by proteolysis through β-TrCP.  β-TrCP recognizes cyclin F through a non-canonical degron site (TSGXXS) after its phosphorylation by Casein Kinase II.  The degradation of cyclin F mediated by β-TrCP occurs at the G2/M transition and this event is required to promote mitotic progression and favours the activation of a transcriptional programme required for mitosis.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation. The search result files were loaded into Pinnacle version 1.0.26.0, and the spectral library threshold settings included a Percolator q-value less than 0.05, XCorr scores above 1.5/2.0/2.2 for singly/doubly/triply charged peptides, and a Mascot Ion score > 29. Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).	2016-07-29	"[[""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201600300"",""PMID:28195392""]]"

MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

Surprisingly, the complete established mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide was observed by protein regulations in SW480, but not in HCT116 cells. Comparing the basal protein expression in the two cell lines revealed an 80% convergence of protein identifications, but with significant expression differences, which in turn seem affect the extent of protein regulation. For example, while a clear-cut redox response was observed in SW480 cells upon arsenic treatment, such an effect was lacking in HCT116 cells and the latter express drastically higher levels of the involved redox proteins. Response profiling was then used to investigate four anticancer metallodrugs (KP46, KP772, KP1339 and KP1537) by means of functional groups of proteins and mapped their effects according to DNA repair, endocytosis, protection from oxidative stress, protection from endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress, cell adhesion and mitochondrial function. We were able to characterize the global effects of these metallodrugs on the proteome and generate hypotheses on hitherto unrecognized mechanisms. Significant differences in the two colon cell lines strongly suggest that knowledge of mechanistic hallmarks of anticancer metallodrug action are imperative for the design of clinical studies and that outcome may be enhanced by means of patient stratification strategies according to these hallmarks.

118	PXD009345	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009345	Human holo-transferrin glycation	Understanding the effect of glycation on the function of transferrin, the systemic iron transporter, is fundamental to fully grasp the mechanisms leading to the loss of iron homeostasis observed in diabetes mellitus (DM). The spontaneous reaction with protein amino groups is one of the main causes of glucose toxicity, but the site specificity of this reaction is still poorly understood.  Unbalance of iron metabolism has long been described in DM patients, and one of the main features is the occurrence of non-transferrin-bound iron in the blood serum. The presence of these toxic iron species is observed, despite low transferrin saturation levels. Here in, an in vitro approach was used to study human holo-transferrin glycation in detail. Holo-transferrin was incubated with increasing concentration of glucose (10; 20; 100 and 500 mM) and glycation sites were identified using nano-reverse phase – liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (nLC-MS).  Overall 21 glycation hotspots were identified with lysine residues 103, 312 and 380 proving to be the most reactive sites. Glycation specificity was found to be remarkably different from that described for apo-transferrin.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

The melanoma-specific oncogene MITF resides at the epicenter of this amplicon1 . However, whether other loci present in this amplicon also contribute to melanomagenesis is unknown. Here we show that the recently annotated long non-coding RNA gene LINC01212 is consistently cogained with MITF. In addition to being amplified, LINC01212 is a target of the lineage-specific transcription factor SOX10 and, consequently, it is expressed in more than 90% of human melanomas, but not in normal adult tissues. Whereas exogenous LINC01212 functions in trans to increase melanoma clonogenic potential, LINC01212 knock-down drastically decreases the viability of melanoma cells irrespective of their transcriptional cell state, BRAF, NRAS or TP53 status and increases their sensitivity to MAPK-targeting therapeutics both in vitro and in Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) models. Mechanistically, LINC01212 interacts with p32, a master regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism, to increase its mitochondrial targeting and pro-oncogenic function. Our results indicate that targeting the lineage addiction oncogene LINC01212, especially in combination with BRAFV600Einhibitors, disrupts vital mitochondrial functions in a cancer-cell specific manner and is therefore expected to deliver highly effective and tissuerestricted anti-melanoma therapeutic responses.

BSCR is also associated with endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP)2, an enzyme involved in processing HLA class I ligands. We analyzed the relationship between both risk factors, to address the basis for their joint association with BSCR. Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry was used to characterize the effects of ERAP2 on the A*29:02-bound peptidome. An ERAP2-negative cell line was transduced with lentiviral constructs containing GFP or GFP-ERAP2, and the A*29:02 peptidomes from mock- and ERAP2-transduced cells were compared. A similar analysis was performed with two A*29:02-positive, ERAP1-concordant, cell lines differing in their expression or not of ERAP2. In both comparisons the presence of ERAP2 affected the following features of the A*29:02 peptidome: 1) Length, with increased amounts of peptides >9-mers, and 2) N-terminal residues, with less ERAP2-susceptible and more hydrophobic ones. The paradoxical effects on peptide length suggest that unproductive binding to ERAP2 might protect some peptides from over-trimming. The influence on N-terminal residues is consistent with a double effect of ERAP2: a direct one on peptide trimming and improved processing in concert with ERAP1. The alterations in the A*29:02 peptidome suggest that the association of ERAP2 with BSCR is through its effects on peptide processing.  These differ from those on the ankylosing spondylitis-associated HLA-B*27. Thus, ERAP2 alters the peptidome of distinct HLA molecules as a function of their specific binding preferences, influencing different pathological outcomes in an allele-dependent way.

Here, we identify  the molecular features in the protein and in heparin required for binding and their effects on the potentiation of TGF-ß1’s activity on hMSCs. Using a proteomics “Protect and Label” approach, lysines K291, K304, K309, K315, K338, K373, K375 and K388 were  identified as being directly involved in binding heparin. Competition assays in an optical biosensor demonstrated that TGF-ß1 does require N- and 6-O-sulfate groups for binding but that 2-O-sulfate groups are unlikely to underpin the interaction. Heparin-derived  oligosaccharides as short as degree of polymerization (dp) 4 have a weak ability to compete for TGF-ß1 binding to heparin, which increases with the length of the oligosaccharide to reach a maximum between dp18 and dp24. In cell-based assays, heparin, 2-O-,  6-O- and N-desulfated re-N-acetylated heparin and oligosaccharides 14–24 saccharides (dp14–24) in length all increased the  phosphorylation of SMAD2 after 6 h of stimulation with TGF-ß1. The results provide the structural basis for a model of  heparin/heparan sulfate binding to TGF-ß1 and demonstrate that the features in the polysaccharide required for binding are not  identical to those required for sustaining the signaling by TGF-ß1 in hMSCs.

Many techniques have been developed to study phosphorylation dynamics, including several mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods. Over the last few decades, substantial developments have been made in MS techniques for the large-scale identification of proteins and their post-translational modifications. Nevertheless, all of the current MS-based techniques for quantifying protein phosphorylation dynamics rely on the measurement of changes in peptide abundance levels and many methods suffer from low confidence in phosphopeptide identification due to poor fragmentation. Here we have optimized an approach for the Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids by Phosphate (SILAP) using [-18O4]ATP in nucleo to determine global site-specific phosphorylation rates. The advantages of this metabolic labeling technique are: increased confidence in phosphorylated peptide identification, direct labeling of phosphorylation sites, measurement phosphorylation rates, and the identification of actively phosphorylated sites in a cell-like environment. In this study we calculated approximate rate constants for over 500 phosphorylation sites based on labeling progress curves. We measured a wide range of phosphorylation rate constants from 0.34 min-1 to 0.001 min-1.  Finally, we applied SILAP to determine sites that have different phosphorylation kinetics during G1/S and M phase. We found that most sites have very similar phosphorylation rates under both conditions; however a small subset of sites on proteins involved in the mitotic spindle were more actively phosphorylated during M phase, while proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription were more actively phosphorylated during G1/S phase.

Serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation, methionine oxidation, and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications and cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification. Up to two missed cleavages were allowed for a trypsin digest search. Scaffold (version 4.0.5, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, Or) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. All search results were loaded into Scaffold in a Mud-Pit type setup. Peptide identifications were accepted at over 95% probability and protein identifications were accepted at over 99% probability according to the PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet algorithms. The filtered peptide identifications from Mascot and X!Tandem were loaded into an in-house software program, which uses a nave Bayes model of co-eluting peptides identified in each run to predict retention times of peptides that were not identified in all runs. This is especially important for time course analysis because it fills in time point measurements from runs containing essentially the same peptides, but different sets of MS2 identifications. Phosphorylated peptides from the database searches and our in-house developed software were used to model the isotope distribution for each peptide based on its chemical formula in order to calculate the expected intensity distributions for relevant isotopic labeling states. Isotopic labeling states were defined based on their shared isotopic perturbation, i.e. light phosphorylated peptides with no incorporated 18O, versus heavy phosphorylated peptides with between one and three incorporated 18O. The signal intensities of the raw isotopologue peaks was partitioned between the isotopic labeling states using linear regression. Finally, we determined phosphorylation site localization scores using AScore and used a score cutoff of 20 for assigning confident phosphorylation sites. We used the maximum phosphorylation site localization score to filter peptides identified by more than one MS2 spectrum.  Processed and raw data is made available by deposition in the Chorus repository (https://chorusproject.org/pages/index.html).   A signal to noise cutoff of 10 (where the signal was the fitted intensity for the light isotopic labeling state, and the noise was the standard error of the fitted intensity) was used to filter unlabeled phosphopeptides for analysis. This ensured that the signal was high enough to confidently measure the ratio of unlabeled to labeled phosphopeptide. Phosphorylation progress curves (increase in heavy label/light labeled phosphopeptide over time) were fit using the non-linear least squares SSAsympOrig function in the R 2.15.0 environment.	2014-01-10	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.O113.036145"",""PMID:24532841""]]"

However, we currently lack a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for target recruitment and selectivity, which is critically required to enable rational design of degraders. Here we utilize comprehensive characterization of the ligand dependent CRBN/BRD4 interaction to demonstrate that binding between proteins that have not evolved to interact is plastic. Multiple X-ray crystal structures show that plasticity results in several distinct low energy binding conformations, which are selectively bound by ligands. We demonstrate that computational protein-protein docking can reveal the underlying inter-protein contacts and inform the design of the first BRD4 selective degrader that can discriminate between highly homologous BET bromodomains. Our findings that plastic inter-protein contacts confer selectivity for ligand-induced protein dimerization provide a conceptual framework for the development of heterobifunctional ligands.

While the isolation of MHC I-associated peptides (MIPs) typically used mild acid elution (MAE) or immunoprecipitation (IP), limited information currently exists regarding their respective analytical merits. Here, we present a comparison of these approaches for the isolation of two different B-cell lymphoblasts cell models, and report on the recovery, reproducibility, scalability and complementarity of identification from each method. Both approaches yielded reproducible datasets for peptide extracts obtained from 2 to 100 million cells, with 2016 to 5093 MIPs, respectively. The IP typically provides up to 6.4 fold increase in MIPs compared to the MAE. We extended the comprehensiveness of these immunopeptidome analyses using personalized genomic database of B-cell lymphoblasts, and discovered that 0.4 % of their respective MIP repertoire harbored non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (also known as minor histocompatibility antigens, MiHAs).

Exosomes were enriched with high purity using differential centrifugation from pooled cerebrospinal fluids.  The sample pooling strategy included pre-classification by cytokine level, which improved target molecule identification by providing enhanced fold change ratios and lower p-values when the subsets with high-cytokines were compared to each other.  In addition to the spectral counts and label-free quantification, orthogonal quantitative validation was performed using tandem mass spectrometry analysis via UPLC and Orbitrap or Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap instrumentation.  The proteomic datasets with 442 significant exosomal proteins detected putative disease specific biomarkers, glial fibrillary acidic protein and fibronectin for neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis, respectively.  Additional investigation of expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein and fibronectin revealed their presence in intact exosomes as detected by flow cytometry.  ELISA measurement of glial fibrillary acidic protein within individual samples demonstrated diagnostic applicability by appropriately clustering disease groups.  Expression levels of target molecules from label-free quantification were in good agreement with those from Western blotting.  Finally, MetaCore pathway analysis of identified proteins supported the involvement of these proteins in disease progression via neurological pathway involvement.

We aimed to identify a reliable panel of biological predictors, present in synovial fluid, which can be used in the preoperative setting to optimise patient selection and therapy efficacy. The-long term aim is to reduce the number of patients who progress to end-stage OA and require knee replacement by making earlier, less invasive treatments more effective. In this first stage, we have taken synovial fluid aspirates from patients undergoing autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) at our centre in Oswestry, UK.

However, to obtain substantive results in biomarker discovery studies large patient cohorts necessarily need to be analyzed. Consequently, this would lead to an unmanageable number samples to be measured if sample preparation protocols with extensive fractionation methods are applied. Hence, the performance of simple workflows allowing for ""one sample, one shot"" experiments have been evaluated in this study. In detail, sixteen different protocols implying modifications at the stages of desalting, delipidation, deglycosylation and tryptic digestion have been tested. Each method has been individually evaluated regarding various performance criteria and comparative analyses have been conducted to uncover possible complementarities. Here, the best performance in terms of proteome coverage has been assessed for a combination of acetone precipitation with in-gel digestion. Finally, a mapping of all obtained protein identifications with putative biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) revealed several proteins easily detectable in bile fluid. These results can build the basis for future studies with large and well-defined patient cohorts in a more disease-related context, instead of a technical one as reported here."

Serum samples were trypsin-digested and fractionated by SCX chromatography prior to SRM and PRM measurements. PRM data obtained by high-resolution mass spectrometry correlated better with ELISA measurements than SRM data measured on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. While all three methods (SRM, PRM, ELISA) were able to quantify HSP90 alpha in serum at the ng/mL level, the use of PRM on a high-resolution mass spectrometer reduced variation. To rule out that the observed differences in SRM and PRM are due to different mass spectrometry systems, the SCX fractions were measured on the same high-resolution instrument (Orbitrap) in the ion trap mode (IT-PRM); such measurements showed that intense co-eluting signals were present in the SRM method, but these interfering peaks were eliminated in the high-resolution PRM mode. Thus, this report shows that it is possible to measure ng/mL levels of HSP90 alpha in a reproducible, selective and sensitive way using PRM. This opens up the possibility to quantify low levels of multiple proteins in complex samples based on a fractionation strategy on tryptic peptides followed by SRM and PRM.

To determine the variability (CV%) of the y-transitions (endogenous and SIL) relating to YIDQEELNK and DQVANSAFVER in each serum sample, the percentage of each y-ion transition was calculated by the ratio of its peak area to the total peak area for all 43 sera measured. Considering that the intensities of the relevant transitions differ, the weighted CV (expressed in percentages) was calculated from the CV for each y-transition by multiplying the CV with the averaged ratio transition/total peak area measured in 43 serum samples. Additionally, the statistical significance (unpaired t-test) was determined of the weighted CVs between YIDQEELNK and DQVANSAFVER (endogenous and SIL).	2017-05-29	"[[""DOI:10.1002/prca.201700107"",""PMID:28975736""]]"

Because of their small size, peptides overcome cell membranes and epithelial barriers more freely than proteins. Among the peptides found in blood, there are both fragments of proteins secreted by various tissues and performing their function in plasma, as well as receptor ligands: hormones, cytokines, mediators of the cellular response. In addition, in minor amounts, there are disease peptide markers (for example, oncomarkers) and even foreign peptides related to pathogenic organisms and infection agents. To characterize the normal peptidome LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out of blood serum and plasma samples taken from 20 healthy donors on TripleTOF 5600+ mass-spectrometer.

Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (HFS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene CMG2. Patients develop subcutaneous nodules and painful joint contracture. CMG2 is a transmembrane protein of poorly understood physiological function. To understand better the pathogenesis of HFS and the role of CMG2 in this disease, we compared by mass-spectrometry the composition of nodular and matching non-nodular tissues. Two tissue pairs were analyzed, both obtained after surgical resection of nodules from a HFS patient. Our shotgun proteomics analysis showed that nodules were enriched in serum protein, which correlated with previous descriptions of blood vessel leakage in these tissues. Importantly, we also observed a clear accumulation of collagen VI in nodules. Collagen VI accumulation was caused by CMG2 loss-of-function and is the main cause of the nodule formation.

Initial biological evaluation of this compound reveals in vitro and in vivo anticancer ac-tivities. We performed a shotgun proteomic analysis using Orbitrap liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to investigate the changes in the protein profiles in cancer cells upon DHE treatment. DHE affected cancer-associated signaling pathways, including NF-B, β-catenin and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Through quantitative pathway and key-node analysis of the proteomics data, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and c-Jun kinase (JNK) were found to be the key components in DHE’s modulated biological pathways. Furthermore, based on the pathway analysis as well as chemical similarity, DHE is predicted to be a phytoestrogen. Our predictions derived from proteomic, bio-informatic and chemoinformatic analyses were validated with individual cell-based experiments.

In this current study, detailed peptidomic analysis of 26 ovarian cancer and 15 non-cancer samples of biological fluids (ascites and sera) were performed using TripleTOF 5600+ mass-spectrometer.

For this procedure, we ran ProteinPilot in identification mode with the following parameters: no specific digestion, TripleTOF 5600 instrument, thorough ID search with detected protein threshold 95.0% against the UniProt human protein knowledgebase. For thorough protein identification, the generated peak lists were searched with the MASCOT (version 2.5.1, Matrix Science Ltd, UK) and X! Tandem (VENGEANCE, 2015.12.15, The Global Proteome Machine Organization) search engines against the UniProt human protein knowledgebase. The precursor and fragment mass tolerance were set at 20 ppm and 50 ppm, respectively. Database-searching parameters included the following: no specific digestion. For X! Tandem we also selected parameters that allowed quick check for protein N-terminal residue acetylation, peptide N-terminal glutamine ammonia loss or peptide N-terminal glutamic acid water loss. Resulting files were submitted to the Scaffold 4 software (version 4.2.1, Proteome Software, Inc, USA) for validation and further analysis. We used the local false discovery rate scoring algorithm with standard experiment-wide protein grouping. For the evaluation of peptide hits, a false discovery rate less than 1% was selected for peptides only. False positive identifications were based on reverse database analysis.	2018-04-03	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.dib.2018.12.056"",""PMID:30627607""]]"

Although a large number of the observed mutations is believed to be not causally linked with cancer, the functional effects of many rare mutations but also of combinations of driver mutations are often unknown. Here, we perform a systems analysis of a model of EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer resistant to targeted therapy that integrates whole exome sequencing, global time-course discovery phosphoproteomics and computational modeling to identify functionally relevant molecular alterations. Our approach allows for a complexity reduction from over 2,000 genetic events potentially involved in mediating resistance to only 44 phosphoproteins and 35 topologically close genetic alterations. We perform single- and combination-drug testing against the predicted phosphoproteins and discovered that targeting of HSPB1, DBNL and AKT1 showed potent anti-proliferative effects overcoming resistance against EGFR-inhibitory therapy. Our approach may therefore be used to complement mutational profiling to identify functionally relevant molecular aberrations and propose combination therapies across cancers.

Many of the RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that aggregate in neurodegenerative diseases, including TDP-43 and FUS, self-assemble into RNA granules through disordered low complexity (LC) domains. We report here that a LC domain within U1-70K, that is comprised of tandem arrays of basic (R/K) and acidic (D/E) residues, shares many of the same properties of the Q/N-rich prion-like LC domains found in TDP-43 and FUS. These properties include the ability to self-assemble into oligomers, and to form nuclear granules in cells. To analyze the functional roles of the U1-70K LC domains, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of recombinant U1-70K and deletions lacking the C-terminal LC domain(s) followed by quantitative proteomics. Using a network-driven approach, functional classes of U1-70K interacting proteins were identified that showed a varying dependency on the U1-70K LC domain(s) for their interaction. We characterize a family of structurally homologous RBPs containing U1-70K LC1-like domains including LUC7L3 and RBM25, which require their respective LC1-like domains for reciprocal interactions with U1-70K and for participation in nuclear RNA granules. Finally, we also show that the LC1 domain of U1-70K can interact with Tau from AD brain supporting a hypothesis that mixed charge structural motifs on U1-70K and other RBPs could mediate cooperative interactions with pathological tau isoforms	"[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]"		"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]"	"[""Q Exactive""]"	"[""Biological""]"	"[""Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry proteomics"",""Shotgun proteomics""]"	"[""MS1 intensity based label-free quantification method""]"	U1-70K	Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Tryptic peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS essentially as described (28). Peptides were resuspended in loading buffer (0.1% formic acid, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, 1% acetonitrile) and separated on a self-packed C18 (1.9 um Dr. Maisch, Germany) fused silica column (20 cm x 75 μM internal diameter; New Objective, Woburn, MA) by a NanoAcquity UHPLC (Waters, Milford, FA) and monitored on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Elution was performed over a 140-minute gradient at a rate of 300 nL/min with buffer B ranging from 3% to 80% (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid and 5% DMSO in water, buffer B: 0.1 % formic and 5% DMSO in acetonitrile). The mass spectrometer cycle was programmed to collect one full MS scan followed by 10 data dependent MS/MS scans. The MS scans (300-1800 m/z range, 1,000,000 AGC, 100 ms maximum ion time) were collected at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200 in profile mode and the MS/MS spectra (2 m/z isolation width, 28 normalized collision energy (NCE), 50,000 AGC target, 50 ms maximum ion time) were acquired at a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200. Dynamic exclusion was set to exclude previous sequenced precursor ions for 30 seconds. Precursor ions with +1, and +6 or higher charge states were excluded from sequencing.  All raw files have been uploaded to the Proteome Xchange consortium. Protein Database Search. Raw data files were analyzed using MaxQuant v1.5.2.8 with Thermo Foundation 2.0 for RAW file reading capability (29). The search engine Andromeda was used to build and search a concatenated target-decoy UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) containing both Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL human reference protein sequences (90,411 target sequences downloaded April 21, 2015), plus 245 contaminant proteins included as a parameter for Andromeda search within MaxQuant (30). Methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da), asparagine and glutamine deamidation (+0.9840 Da), and protein N-terminal acetylation (+42.0106 Da) were variable modifications (up to 5 allowed per peptide); cysteine was assigned a fixed carbamidomethyl modification (+57.0215 Da). Only fully tryptic peptides were considered with up to 2 miscleavages in the database search. A precursor mass tolerance of ±20 ppm was applied prior to mass accuracy calibration and ±4.5 ppm after internal MaxQuant calibration. Other search settings included a maximum peptide mass of 6,000 Da, a minimum peptide length of 6 residues, 0.05 Da tolerance for high resolution MS/MS scans. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide spectral matches, proteins, and site decoy fraction were all set to 1%. The label free quantitation (LFQ) algorithm in MaxQuant (31,32) was used for protein quantitation. All MaxQuant files are provided  Protein co-expression network analysis. The R package WGCNA was used to construct a co-enrichment networks using the source code found here (33). Threshold power Beta for reduction of false positive correlations (i.e. the beneficial effect of enforcing scale free topology) was sampled in increments of 0.5, and as the target scale free topology R² was approached, 0.1. The power selected was the lowest power at which scale free topology R² was approximately 0.80, or in the case of not reaching 0.80, the power at which a horizontal asymptote (plateau) was nearly approached before further increasing the power had a negative effect on scale free topology R².  Other parameters were selected as previously optimized for protein abundance networks (28). Thus, for the signed network build on protein LFQ abundances obtained from IP-LC-MS/MS, parameters were input into the WGCNA::blockwiseModules() function as follows: Beta 10.9, mergeCutHeight 0.07, pamStage TRUE, pamRespectsDendro TRUE, reassignThreshold p<0.05, deepSplit 4, minModuleSize 15, corType bicor, and maxBlockSize greater than the total number of proteins.T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) analysis was performed as follows (34). Proteins with WGCNA intramodular kME>=0.50 were retained, and all duplicated values removed, as well asproteins with any missing values for the 16 non-IgG measurements. Then Rtsne R package Barnes-Hut-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) Rtsne function was run on the LFQ expression matrix to reduce dimensionality from 16 to 2. The remaining points or proteins (n=375) are colored according to WGCNA module membership.

RNA-binding proteins play central roles in RNA regulation, including translation and turnover. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 is highly expressed in hESCs to maintain their undifferentiated state and prevent default neural fate. Notably, loss of CSDE1 accelerates neural differentiation and potentiates neurogenesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of CSDE1 impairs neural differentiation. We find that CSDE1 post-transcriptionally modulates core components of multiple regulatory nodes of hESC identity, neuroectoderm commitment and neurogenesis. Among these key pro-neural/neuronal factors, CSDE1 binds fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) and vimentin (VIM) mRNAs as well as transcripts involved in neuron projection development regulating their stability and translation. Thus, our results uncover CSDE1 as a central post-transcriptional regulator of hESC identity and neurogenesis.

Despite its important role, chemical tools for profiling the composition and dynamics of ER proteins remain very limited because of the labile nature of these proteins. Here, we developed ER-localizable reactive molecules (called ERMs) as tools for ER-focused chemical proteomics. ERMs can spontaneously localize in the ER of living cells and selectively label ER-associated proteins with a combined affinity and imaging tag, enabling tag-mediated ER protein enrichment and identification with liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The ERM probes could be used simultaneously with the nucleus- and mitochondria-localizable reactive molecules previously developed by our group, which enabled orthogonal organellar chemoproteomics in a single biological sample. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes in ER-associated proteins in response to tunicamycin-induced ER stress was performed by combining ER-specific labeling with SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based quantitative MS technology. Our results demonstrated that ERM-based chemical proteomics provides a powerful tool for labeling and profiling ER-related proteins in living cells.

Serum samples were trypsin-digested and fractionated by SCX chromatography prior to SRM and PRM measurements. PRM data obtained by high-resolution mass spectrometry correlated better with ELISA measurements than SRM data measured on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. While all three methods (SRM, PRM, ELISA) were able to quantify HSP90 alpha in serum at the ng/mL level, the use of PRM on a high-resolution mass spectrometer reduced variation. To rule out that the observed differences in SRM and PRM are due to different mass spectrometry systems, the SCX fractions were measured on the same high-resolution instrument (Orbitrap) in the ion trap mode (IT-PRM); such measurements showed that intense co-eluting signals were present in the SRM method, but these interfering peaks were eliminated in the high-resolution PRM mode. Thus, this report shows that it is possible to measure ng/mL levels of HSP90 alpha in a reproducible, selective and sensitive way using PRM. This opens up the possibility to quantify low levels of multiple proteins in complex samples based on a fractionation strategy on tryptic peptides followed by PRM.

In the field of neuroproteomics the most popular mass spectrometry-based strategy for biomarker discovery studies is data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. In this study we evaluate the use of DIA for native CSF analytics with particular focus on spectral library generation for data analysis, DIA data reproducibility and identification of brain specific proteins.

Trypsin was selected as digestion enzyme with two maximum missed cleavage sites. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm and fragment mass tolerance to 20 mmu. Oxidation at methionine was set as dynamic modification, carbamidomethylation as static modification at cysteine. Using the target decoy PSM validator decoy database search was performed with target FDR of 1%). For analysis with Spectronaut different spectral libraries were generated by using Spectronaut 9.0 (Biognosys). Therefore, different .MSF files from PD were uploaded to the “Prepare” perspective of Spectronaut and treated with the following settings: for identification only peptides with high confidence level (equals a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%) were considered and protein inference was performed by Spectronaut. Spectral Library Filters were set to no missed cleavage filters, no peptide charge filters, number of best fragment ions between 3 and 6 in a mass range of 300 – 1800 m/z. The first library (library A) consisted of five .MSF files of untreated CSF samples. The second library (library B) was generated by using library A plus 5 .MSF files of analyzed whole blood. The third library (library C) contained library A and additional 54 .MSF files originating from human substantia nigra analyses. The fourth library (library D) combined library B. These Libraries were used to analyze native CSF measured in data-independent (DIA) mode, subdividing a mass range of 400 – 1000 m/z into 30 isolation windows with an equal width of 20 m/z and one full scan with a loop cycle of 10. The full MS was performed with a resolution of 30,000 at 200 m/z (AGC 3e6, 80 ms maximum injection time). DIA analysis was operated with a resolution of 15,000 at 200 m/z (AGC 1e6, auto maximum injection time, default charge state 2). This ended up in a cycle time of approx. 2.2 s. The .RAW files were converted into .HTRMS files by using the Raw to HTRMS Converter Professional provided by Biognosys. Those .HTRMS files were analyzed via Spectronaut 9.0 in the “Review” perspective by applying the four different libraries in single experiments. The following settings were applied: dynamic XIC RT Extraction Window, enabled Interference Correction, enabled Cross Run Normalization, quantitation on MS2 level, automatic Protein Inference Workflow and p-value normal distribution estimator. All results were filtered by a Q value of 0.01 at peptide and protein level.	2018-04-27	"[[""DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00308"",""PMID:30207155""]]"

Peptide quantification was performed in Progenesis QI software with “Relative quantification using Hi-N” where the 3 (n=3) abundant peptides for each protein are averaged for quantification. For minimum threshold for data quantification, Progenesis Q1 defaults were used. Searches were performed in Mascot v2.4.0 (Matrix Science); peptide identity search was performed using Mascot v2.4.0 against the UniProtKB/SwissProt database (356786 entries at the time of search) restricting taxonomy to Human (Genus), Bacteria (Kingdom), Candida (Genus), Trichomonas (Genus). For the present study, only proteins restricted to Human taxonomy were analyzed. Enzyme specificity was set to “Trypsin” and 2 missed cleavages were allowed. A fixed modification was carbamidomethyl (C) of cysteine, and a variable modification was set to oxidation (O) of methionine. Mass tolerance for precursor ions was 10 ppm and 0.5 Da mass tolerance for fragment ions. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm. The peptides identified were further confirmed using Scaffold (version 4.4.1) with the following criteria: ≤0.1% false discovery rate (FDR) peptide identification, ≤1% FDR protein identification and ≥2 unique peptides/protein. When proteins could not be differentiated based on the MS analysis because they contain similar peptides, proteins were grouped parsimoniously.	2018-05-09	"[[""PMID:30504243"",""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra118.000757""]]"

187	PXD009751	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009751	LC-MSMS of the 12H018 MHC class I immunopeptidome	MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.

The obtained peptide mixtures were introduced into an LC-MS/MS system, the Ultimate 3000 (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in-line connected to an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Samples were first loaded on a trapping column (made in-house, 100 um internal diameter (I.D.) x 20 mm, 5 um beads C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch). After back-flushing from the trapping column, the sample was loaded on a reverse-phase column (made in-house, 75 um I.D. x 150 mm, 5 um beads C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch). Peptides were loaded with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile), and were separated with a linear gradient from 2% solvent A' (0.05% formic acid) to 55% solvent B' (0.05% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min followed by a wash reaching 100% solvent B'. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS acquisition for the six most abundant peaks in a given MS spectrum. Full scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at a target value of 1E6 with a resolution of 60,000. The six most intense ions were then isolated for fragmentation in the linear ion trap, with a dynamic exclusion of 60 s. Peptides were fragmented after filling the ion trap at a target value of 1E4 ion counts. From the MS/MS data in each LC run, Mascot Generic Files were created using the Mascot Distiller software (version 2.3.01, Matrix Science). While generating these peak lists, grouping of spectra was allowed with a maximum intermediate retention time of 30 s and a maximum intermediate scan count of 5 was used where possible. Grouping was done with 0.005 Da precursor tolerance. A peak list was only generated when the MS/MS spectrum contained more than 10 peaks. There was no de-isotoping and the relative signal to noise limit was set at 2. These peak lists were then searched with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) using the Mascot Daemon interface (version 2.3, Matrix Science).   Spectra were searched against the human (H. sapiens) Swiss-Prot database. 13C2D3-acetylation of lysine side-chains, carbamidomethylation of cysteine and methionine oxidation to methionine-sulfoxide were set as fixed modifications for the N-terminal COFRADIC analyses. Variable modifications were 13C2D3-acetylation and acetylation of protein N-termini. Pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine was additionally set as a variable modification. Mass tolerance on precursor ions was set to 10 ppm (with Mascot's C13 option set to 1) and on fragment ions to 0.5 Da. Endoproteinase semi-Arg-C/P (Arg-C specificity with arginine-proline cleavage allowed) was set as enzyme allowing no missed cleavages. The peptide charge was set to 1+, 2+, 3+ and instrument setting was put to ESI-TRAP. Only peptides that were ranked one and scored above the threshold score, set at 99% confidence, were withheld. Quantification of the degree of Nt-Acetylation was performed as described previously (1). All data management was done in ms_lims (2).

Exploring human ciliopathy genes, including monogenic obesity syndrome genes, has been a rich source of critical ciliary mechanisms. Using AP-MS purification of interactors of the CEP19 monogenic obesity gene, we identify factors and the first known mechanism for triggering ciliary entry of IFT complexes. CEP19 binds the CEP350 and FOP centriolar components and the highly conserved RABL2 GTPase. We discovered that the CEP19-RABL2 complex is first recruited by the centriolar CEP350/FOP complex, concurrently activates nucleotide exchange to capture and release intraflagellar transport B holocomplexes from a large centriolar pool to intraflagellar transport. The CEP19 network of interacting proteins regulates ciliary entry and ciliation, providing a new example of ciliary mechanisms deficient in monogenic obesity syndromes.

Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, whereas oxidation of methionine, protein N-terminal acetylation, pyro-glutamination for N-terminal glutamine, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine, and stable isotopes of arginine (13C6 and 15N4) and lysine (13C6 and 15N2) were set as variable modifications. Trypsin was defined as a proteolytic enzyme and a maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed. The mass tolerance was set to 3 parts per million (ppm) for peptide masses and 0.8 Da for MS/MS peaks. In the process of peptide identification, we conducted decoy database searching by Mascot and applied a filter to satisfy a false positive rate lower than 1%. The ratio of heavy/light for each spectrum was calculated by the quantitation node and the probability of phosphorylation for each Ser/Thr/Tyr site on the peptide sequence was calculated by the PhosphoRS node in Proteome Discoverer ver. 1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Phosphorylation sites with a site probability above 75% were regarded as confidently localized. After selecting the data supported by at least two peptide matches, the heavy/light ratios of phosphopeptides with confidently localized phosphorylation sites were log2-transformed and normalized based on the median according to the previous report. The phosphopeptides exhibiting more than 2-fold changes were considered as regulated for further computational analyses.	2015-08-14	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:26670566""]]"

Dependent on Thr668 phosphorylation in APP, which influences amyloidogenic APP processing, FE65 undergoes nuclear translocation, thereby transmitting a signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus. As this translocation may be relevant in Alzheimer disease (AD) and as FE65 consists of three protein-protein interaction domains able to bind and affect a variety of other proteins and down-stream signaling pathways, the identification of the FE65 interactome is of central interest in AD research. In this study, we identified 121 proteins as new potential FE65 interacting proteins in a pulldown/mass spectrometry approach using human post-mortem brain samples as protein pools for recombinantly expressed FE65. Co-immunoprecipitation assays further validated the interaction of FE65 with the candidates SV2A and SERCA2. In parallel, we investigated the whole cell proteome of primary hippocampal neurons from FE65/FE65L1 double knockout mice.

Using shotgun proteomics, known marker molecules including PMEL, CRP, SAA and CSPG4 were found deregulated in patients with metastatic melanoma. Targeted analysis of 58 selected proteins with multiple reaction monitoring was applied for independent data verification. In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.

To identify substrates of ubiquitin ligases, we have recently devised a method based on proximity-dependent biotin labeling. In this method, an E3 ubiquitin ligase of interest is expressed as a fusion to Escherichia coli biotin ligase BirA together with a biotin acceptor peptide (AP)-tagged ubiquitin. The BirA-directed biotin labeling of AP depends on the proximity of the two fusion proteins in the cell, which leads to preferential labeling of ubiquitinated E3 substrates. In this study, we applied this procedure to RNF8 and identified its substrates.

However tools able to discriminate unanchored polyubiquitin chains of different isopeptide linkages have not been described. We describe the design of a linker-optimised ubiquitin-binding domain hybrid (t-UBD) containing two UBDs, a ZnF-UBP domain in tandem with a linkage-selective UBA domain, which exploits avidity effects to afford selective recognition of unanchored Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains. Utilising native MS to quantitatively probe binding affinities we confirm cooperative binding of the UBDs within the synthetic protein, and desired binding specificity for Lys48-linked ubiquitin dimers. Furthermore MS/MS analyses indicate that the t-UBD, when applied as an affinity enrichment reagent, can be used to favour the purification of endogenous unanchored Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains from mammalian cell extracts. Our study indicates that strategies for the rational design and engineering of polyubiquitin chain-selective binding in non-biological polymers are possible, paving the way for the generation of reagents to probe unanchored polyubiquitin chains of different linkages and more broadly the ‘ubiquitome’.

205	PXD009752	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009752	LC-MSMS of the lc2 MHC class I immunopeptidome	MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.

Taking advantage of the distinctive binding affinity of Ga3+ and Fe3+ towards phosphopeptides, we designed a tip-based metal-directed immobilized metal ion affinity (MD-IMAC) chromatography for sequential enrichment of phosphopeptides. On the analysis of Raji B cell, this sequential Ga3+-Fe3+-IMAC strategy demonstrated 1.5-3.5 fold superior phosphoproteomic coverage compared to the single IMAC (Fe3+, Ti4+, Ga3+ and Al3+). In addition, as high as 92% among the 6283 phosphopeptides was uniquely enriched by either 1st Ga3+-IMAC fraction (41%) or 2nd Fe3+-IMAC fraction (51%).  The complementary property of Ga3+ and Fe3+ was further shown on the exclusively superior efficiency to enriched almost all the 1214 multiply phosphorylated peptides (99.4%) by 1st Ga3+-IMAC, while as low as 10% of 5069 monophosphorylated phosphopeptides was commonly enriched by both fractions. Application of our sequential Ga3+-Fe3+-IMAC approach to a human lung cancer tissue allowed the identification of 2560 unique phosphopeptides with only 8% overlapping. The fractionation ability was shown not only on the mono phosphopeptides and multiply phosphopeptides but also on the basic and acidic phosphopeptides; acidiphilic phosphorylation sites were predominately present in 1st Ga3+-IMAC (72%) and 85% Pro-directed and 79% basophilic phosphorylation sites were enriched by 2nd Fe3+-IMAC. Most interestingly, this strategy complementarily mapped different kinase substrate on the protein as well as site levels in multiple cellular pathways related to cancer invasion and metastasis of lung cancer ., Given the demonstrated fractionation ability, reproducibility, sensitivity and ease of tip preparation, we hope that this Ga3+-Fe3+-IMAC allow more comprehensive characterization of phosphoproteome in vitro and in vivo.  Database search: The raw MS/MS data obtained by TripleTOF 5600 were processed using AB_SCIEX MS Data Converter with default parameters. All MS/MS files were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.3) against the SwissPort database (version 57.8) with the following constraints: an allowance for tryptic peptides of up to two missed cleavage sites, a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.05 Da, and a parent ion tolerance of 10 ppm. Phosphorylation (S, T, Y) and oxidation (M) were selected as variable modifications. Searching on a randomized decoy database created by Mascot was required to evaluate the false discovery rate associated with protein identification. The false discovery rates with a Mascot score (p< 0.05) ranged between 0% and 1% in this study.

In three patients, two of which suffered from cachexia, a tissue damage signature was determined, consisting on nine proteins, PLTP, CD14, TIMP1, S10A8, S10A9, GP1BA, PTPRJ, CD44 and CO4A, as well as increased levels of glycine and asparagine, and decreased levels of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine concentrations, as determined by targeted metabolomics. Remarkably, these molecules are known to be involved in key processes of cancer cachexia. Based on these results, we propose a model how metastatic melanoma may lead to reprogramming of organ functions via formation of platelet activating factors from long-chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines under oxidative conditions and via systemic induction of intracellular calcium mobilization. Calcium mobilization in platelets was demonstrated to regulate several of these marker molecules. Additionally, platelets from melanoma patients proved to be in a rather exhausted state, and platelet-derived eicosanoids implicated in tumor growth were found massively increased in blood from three melanoma patients. Platelets were thus identified as important source of serum protein and lipid alterations in late stage melanoma patients. As a result, the proposed model describes the crosstalk between lipolysis of fat tissue and muscle wasting mediated by oxidative stress, resulting in the metabolic deregulations characteristic for cachexia.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation. The search result files were loaded into Pinnacle version 1.0.26.0, and the spectral library threshold settings included a Percolator q-value less than 0.05, XCorr scores above 1.5/2.0/2.2 for singly/doubly/triply charged peptides, and a Mascot Ion score > 29. Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).	2016-07-29	"[[""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201600300"",""PMID:28195392""]]"

Here we show the role the ion channel subunit Piezo1 (FAM38A). Disruption of mouse Piezo1 gene disturbed vascular development and was embryonic lethal within days of the heart beating to cause blood flow. Importance of Piezo channels as sensors of blood flow was indicated by Piezo1 dependence of shear stress-evoked ionic current and calcium influx in endothelial cells and the ability of exogenous Piezo1 to confer shear stress sensitivity on cells that otherwise lacked. Downstream of this calcium influx was proteoase activity and spatial organization of endothelial cells to the polarity of the applied force. Without Piezo1, normal endothelial cell organization was lacking. The data suggest Piezo1 channels as pivotal integrators of vascular architacture with physiological mechanical force.

One of the hallmarks of AIDP pathogenesis is a significantly elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level in comparison with the peptidome/proteome profile of a representative number of CSF samples obtained from AIDP and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and control patients. In total, 2355 peptide fragments related to 795 proteins were found in CSF samples from AIDP patients, 1066 peptide fragments of 253 proteins in samples from MS patients, and 774 peptide fragments of 220 proteins from control patients. Proteomic studies detected 1103 proteins in the control cohort and 1402 proteins in the AIDP cohort. Our dataset suggests that the proteome of the CSF from AIDP and control patients overlaps by as much as 67%, whereas the peptidome is only 21.5% identical. Comparison of the peptidomic and proteomic data revealed that 80% of the peptides in the CSF of AIDP patients correspond to proteins that are not present in proteomic dataset. Importantly, a considerable number of differentially represented peptides are related to the proteins involved in the arrangement of the axonal domains. The observed peptidomic dataset indicates that specific proteins, which participate in the arrangement of the myelin sheath in the nodes of Ranvier, are degraded in the course of AIDP.  Here, we show that the proteins that are overrepresented in the CSF of AIDP patients are partially linked with defensive responses to bacteria and viruses. These observations are in line with the upregulation of CSF cytokines associated with innate immunity, which in turn surprisingly suggests that the destruction of axons is not accompanied by any indications of a distinct adaptive autoimmune process. We believe that the presented proteomic and peptidomic dataset of the CSF from AIDP patients will provide useful information regarding the mechanisms of AIDP pathogenesis in comparison with MS, which is the prolonged but incurable autoimmune degradation of the central nervous system.

Here, we present a robust proteomic workflow for the analysis of clinically relevant human cancer tissues, which allows quantitation of thousands of tumor proteins in several hours of measuring time and a total turnaround of a few days. We applied it to a chemorefractory metastatic case of the extremely rare urachal carcinoma. Quantitative comparison of lung metastases and surrounding tissue revealed several significantly upregulated proteins, among them lysine specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A). LSD1 is an epigenetic regulator and is the target of active development efforts in oncology. This demonstrates that clinical cancer proteomics can rapidly and efficiently identify actionable therapeutic options. While currently described for a single case study, we envision that it can be applied broadly to other patients in a similar condition.

Their structure and size, in addition to various transport mechanisms, allow them to remain stable within various biological fluids, surviving in extremely adverse conditions, including low pH, boiling, and freezing. The presence of miRNAs in reproductive fluids, such as follicular, uterine and seminal fluid, indicate potential roles in the reproductive system. These extracellular miRNAs can be transported by lipoproteins (both HDL and LDL) or other proteins, including Argonaute2 (AGO2)  and nucleophosmin1 (NPM1). Another transport system is mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as apoptotic bodies, microvesicles (MVs) and/or exosome-like vesicles. EVs protect miRNAs from degradation and contribute to their stability within biological fluids. Furthermore, EVs can transport a wide range of components packaged in a selective way. For instance, Squadrito et al. (2014), used macrophages and endothelial cells to demonstrate that the sorting of miRNAs into EVs for heterotrophic cell communication is altered by both, the presence of target transcripts and the self-presence of the respectively miRNA. In addition, the signature of miRNAs found in the exosomes significantly differed for those detected in the parent cells. To date, mechanisms controlling the specific loading of miRNAs into exosomes remain unclear. Indeed, several mechanisms may govern exosome sorting of specific subsets of miRNAs. MiRNA sorting appears to be influenced by different pathways and molecules in different cell types and tissues, and miRNAs contain well defined motifs (i.e., EXOmotifs), that direct the miRNA allocation into exosomes before delivery into recipient cells. A recent study showed that this RNA sequence can be recognized by the sumoylated form of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1). Moreover, a terminal 30 nucleotide addition in miRNAs affects their selective sorting in B cells. Another hypothesis suggests that RNAs are selectively sorted depending on the differential affinity of RNA motifs towards the raft-like region of the cytoplasmic surface of microvesicular body (MVB) limiting membranes. Current data indicate that cells can communicate with each other through the transfer of miRNA-loaded exosomes. For example, monocyte-derived exosomes deliver miR-150 to endothelial cells and enhance endothelial cell migration by reducing c-myb expression. The miRNA content of exosomes plays a critical role in such cell-to-cell communication and determines the fate of recipient cells. Thus, exosomes derived from the bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells of myeloma patients promote tumor growth depending on the content of miR-15a in exosomes.  Our group has described a novel cell-to-cell communication mechanism involving the delivery of endometrial miRNAs from the maternal endometrium to the trophectoderm cells of preimplantation embryos. Specifically, in B6C3 derived mouse embryos, we found EV-associated and free miR-30d to cause  overexpression of genes involved in embryonic adhesion processes, including Itb3, Itga7 and Cdh5. Furthermore, supplementing murine embryos with miR-30d significantly improved embryo adhesion, suggesting that external miRNAs may have a functional role as transcriptomic modifiers of preimplantation embryos. Based on profiling of miRNAs in endometrial fluid, maternally-derived miRNAs are present within EVs in the uterine microenvironment. The internalization of maternally-derived exosomes has been visualized, but the mechanism by which miR-30d becomes incorporated into exosomes remains unknown. The present study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of hsa-miR-30d transfer from human endometrial epithelial cells (hEECs) to the interior of exosomes and eventually to early-stage blastocysts, using a mir-30d knockout murine mode.

In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators. The present data suggest that successful pharmacological abrogation of the formation of lipid inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts may not suffice to suppress the release of several other powerful inflammatory mediators which we thus understand to be capable of establishing chronic inflammation states.

236	PXD007153	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007153	Systematic and quantitative assessment of hydrogen peroxide reactivity with cysteines across human proteomes	Protein cysteinyl residues are the mediators of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-dependent redox signaling. However, site-specific mapping of the selectivity and dynamics of these redox reactions in cells poses a major analytical challenge. Here we describe a chemoproteomic platform to systematically and quantitatively analyze the reactivity of thousands of cysteines toward H2O2 in human cells. We identified >900 H2O2-sensitive cysteines, which are defined as the H2O2-dependent redoxome. Although redox sites associated with antioxidative and metabolic functions are consistent, most of the H2O2-dependent redoxome varies dramatically between different cells. Structural analyses reveal that H2O2-sensitive cysteines are less conserved than their redox-insensitive counterparts and display distinct sequence motifs, structural features, and potential for crosstalk with lysine modifications. Notably, our chemoproteomic platform also provides an opportunity to predict oxidation-triggered protein conformational changes. The data are freely accessible as a resource at http://redox.ncpsb.org/OXID/.

The mzML files were searched against a decoy protein database consisting of forward and reversed human RefSeq version 54 database (Sep 25, 2012; 34,590 entries) using MS-GF+ (version 9979)(Kim and Pevzner, 2014). Precursor ion mass tolerance and fragmentation tolerance were both set as 10 ppm for the database search. The maximum number of modiﬁcations and missed cleavages allowed per peptide was three and two, respectively. Different modifications of + 15.9949 Da (methionine oxidation), + 57.0214 Da (iodoacetamide alkylation), +252.1222 (light and heavy IPM-triazohexanoic acid), and + 258.1424 (heavy IPM-triazohexanoic acid) were searched as variable modifications. Spectral identification mzID files generated from the MS-GF+ search were converted to idpXML files for protein assembly using IDPicker 3 (version 3.1.10199.0)(Holman et al., 2012). The maximum Q value of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) was set as 0.5% and each peptide should be identified by at least three spectra in CTRP experiments for each cell line. These stringent filters result in a final false-positive rate below 1% for peptides and their corresponding proteins groups. Peptide quantifications were performed with Skyline software as previously described(Schilling et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015a). Spectral libraries were imported from the mzID files. A subset FASTA database containing all the identifications (with and/or without IPM modification) exported from the IDPicker files was then imported into Skyline (version 3.1). The peptide list was refined in Skyline by removing all unmodified peptides. To further reduce the final false-positive rate of identification and enable reliable quantification of the remaining IPM-modified peptides in the list, all the automatically annotated spectra in the Skyline libraries were manually evaluated as previously described(Tabb et al., 2006). Moreover, the modified peptides whose matched spectra did not contain the major diagnostic fragment ions (m/z 311.12 and 317.14 for light and heavy peptides, respectively, which are generated by fragmentations analogous to those reported for cysteine conjugates(Levsen et al., 2005)) were excluded. After refining the peptide list, Raw files were directly imported into Skyline for automatic peak picking and MS1 filtering using the following criteria. First, the retention time of the PSM-identified peptide was used to position a retention time window (± 2.0 min) across the run lacking the same peptide identification. Second, the resolution for extracting the MS1 filtering chromatogram of the target precursor ions with both light and heavy labeled peptides was set to 60,000 at 400 Th. Following data extraction, graphical displays of chromatographic traces for the top three isotopic peaks were manually inspected for proper peak picking of MS1 filtered peptides and those with isotopic dot product scores lower than 0.8 were rejected. Several additional criteria were used to further ensure the high accuracy and precision of quantification: (1) signal to noise threshold of all the detected peptides was set to 3.0; (2) baseline separation was required between the isotopic peaks of a quantifiable peptide and unknown isobaric interference; (3) manual integration was applied if necessary. The ratios of peptide areas of light peptides to their heavy isotopes (RL:H) were calculated automatically. Quantitation results were obtained from three biological replicates.	2017-07-31	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra117.000108"",""PMID:28827280""]]"

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.

In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators. The present data suggest that successful pharmacological abrogation of the formation of lipid inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts may not suffice to suppress the release of several other powerful inflammatory mediators which we thus understand to be capable of establishing chronic inflammation states.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

The cell surface proteases Lys-gingipain (Kgp) and Arg-gingipains (RgpA and RgpB) are major virulence factors and their proteolytic activity is enhanced by small peptides such as glycylglycine (GlyGly). The reaction kinetics suggested that GlyGly may function as an acceptor molecule for gingipain-catalysed transpeptidation. Purified gingipains and P. gingivalis whole cells were used to digest selected substrates including human haemoglobin in the presence or absence of peptide acceptors. Mass spectrometric analysis of the substrates digested with gingipains in the presence of GlyGly showed that transpeptidation outcompeted hydrolysis while the trypsin-digested controls exhibited predominantly hydrolysis activity. The transpeptidation levels increased with increasing concentration of GlyGly. Purified gingipains and whole cells exhibited extensive transpeptidation activities on human haemoglobin. All haemoglobin cleavage sites were found to be suitable for GlyGly transpeptidation and this transpeptidation enhanced haemoglobin digestion. The transpeptidation products were often more abundant than the corresponding hydrolysis products. In the absence of GlyGly, haemoglobin peptides produced during digestion were utilised as acceptors leading to the detection of up to 116 different transpeptidation products in a single reaction. P. gingivalis cells were able to digest haemoglobin faster when acceptor peptides derived from human serum albumin were included in the reaction suggesting that gingipain-catalysed transpeptidation may be relevant for substrates encountered in vivo. The transpeptidation of host proteins in vivo may potentially lead to the breakdown of immunological tolerance culminating in autoimmune reactions.

Despite intense decades of research, the molecular details in many aspects of their function remain to be fully characterized. To unravel the details of how these viruses operate a thorough understanding of the relationships between the viral protein components is key. Here, we have created HVint, a novel protein-protein intra-viral interaction database for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which integrates data from five external sources. The coverage of the initial interactome was enlarged using evolutionary information, which integrates computational predictions for potential novel interactions in HSV-1. As an experimental validation for these predicted interactions, affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) was performed for the HSV-1 capsid protein, VP26. The VP26 interaction data provided experimental evidence supporting the interactions with pUL31 and pUL40, which were computationally predicted as direct partners. Other indirect interactions within the predicted network, such as pUL32 and pUL21, were also present in the AP-MS experiment. For access to the complete HVint network, we have developed a user-friendly and interactive web interface. Our approach demonstrates the power of computational predictions to assist in the design of targeted experiments for the discovery of novel protein-protein interactions.

Through a targeted drug screen, we found the recently approved multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin to have potent activity in several lung cancer cells independent of its intended target, PKC, or a specific genomic marker. To determine the underlying mechanism of action we applied a layered functional proteomics approach and a new data integration method. Using chemical proteomics, we identified multiple midostaurin kinase targets in these cells. Network-based integration of these targets with quantitative tyrosine and global phosphoproteomics data using protein-protein interactions from the STRING database and NetworKIN substrate prediction suggested multiple targets are relevant for the mode of action of midostaurin. Subsequent functional validation using RNA interference and selective small molecule probes showed that simultaneous inhibition of TBK1, PDK1 and AURKA was required to elicit midostaurin’s cellular effects. Immunoblot analysis of downstream signaling nodes showed that combined inhibition of these targets altered PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathways that in part converged on PLK1. Furthermore, rational combination of midostaurin with the more potent PLK1 inhibitor BI2536, which is in advanced clinical trials, elicited strong synergy. Our results demonstrate that combination of complementary functional proteomics approaches and subsequent network-based data integration can reveal novel insight into the complex mode of action of multi-kinase inhibitors, actionable targets for drug discovery and cancer vulnerabilities. Finally, we illustrate how this knowledge can be utilized for the rational design of synergistic drug combinations with high potential for clinical translation.

In this study, human dermal fibroblasts were inflammatory stimulated with interleukin-1beta and comprehensively analysed with respect to proteins, eicosanoids and metabolites. For eicosadomics, we have established a data-dependent shotgun analysis method capable of identifying inflammation-regulated lipids of yet unknown function. Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators. The present data suggest that successful pharmacological abrogation of the formation of lipid inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts may not suffice to suppress the release of several other powerful inflammatory mediators which we thus understand to be capable of establishing chronic inflammation states.

Cholesteatoma is a serious and destructive growth of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear, with a poorly understood etiopathogenesis. The large scale proteomics approach used in this study highly expands our molecular knowledge of cholesteatoma and implicates several biological functions in its pathology. Human samples of cholesteatoma, neck of cholesteatoma, tympanic membrane, external auditory canal skin, and middle ear mucosa were analyzed. Approximately two thousand unique proteins were identified by label-free nanoLC-MS/MS proteomics.        The protein and peptide identification data were obtained by Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific, version 1.3.0.339) processing of LTQ Orbitrap raw files using the Mascot algorithm (Matrix Sciences, version 2.4.0). To yield comprehensive proteome data the tissue biopsy was separated into ten protein fractions, which were MS analysed separately, and the resulting MS files were subsequently merged in the database analysis. Precursor mass tolerance was 5 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was 0.5 Da. Dynamic Modification was Oxidation (M) and Static Modification was Carbamidomethyl (C); annotated in the PRIDE files as mass deviations (e g for double charged peptides m/z deviation of approximately 8.00 and 28.51 for modification of Met and Cys, respectively). FASTA file was SwissProt_2012_03.fasta (containing 20,255 Homo sapiens sequences). MudPit scoring was applied, and up to two missed trypsin cleavages were accepted.

255	PXD001249	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001249	SNW1 is required for sister chromatid cohesion	Although splicing is essential for the expression of most eukaryotic genes, inactivation of splicing factors causes specific defects in mitosis. The molecular cause of this defect is unknown. Here we show that the spliceosome subunits SNW1 and PRPF8 are essential for sister chromatid cohesion in human cells. A transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that SNW1 or PRPF8 depletion affects the splicing of specific introns in a subset of pre-mRNAs, including pre-mRNAs encoding the cohesion protein sororin and the APC/C subunit APC2. SNW1 depletion causes cohesion defects predominantly by reducing sororin levels, which causes destabilisation of cohesin on DNA. SNW1 depletion also reduces APC/C activity and contributes to cohesion defects indirectly by delaying mitosis and causing ‘cohesion fatigue’. Simultaneous expression of sororin and APC2 from intron-less cDNAs restores cohesion in SNW1 depleted cells. These results indicate that the spliceosome is required for mitosis because it enables expression of genes essential for cohesion. Our transcriptome-wide identification of retained introns in SNW1 and PRPF8 depleted cells may help to understand the aetiology of diseases associated with splicing defects, such as retinosa pigmentosum and cancer.

Here, we report the establishment of an unbiased, multistep ADP-ribosylome data analysis workflow that led to the identification of tyrosine as a novel ARTD1/PARP1 dependent in vivo ADPr-acceptor. MS analyses of in vitro ADP-ribosylated proteins confirmed tyrosine as an ADPr-acceptor amino acid in RPS3A (Y155) and HPF1 (Y238) and demonstrated that trans modification of RPS3A is dependent on HPF1.

Homo Sapiens taxonomy was specified for database searching. The parent ion tolerance was set to 20 ppm. Variable amino acid modifications were oxidized methionine. Trypsin was selected as the enzyme, with two potential missed cleavages, and the normal cleavage mode was used. Only one search round was used with selection of “turbo” scoring. The peptide p value was 1 E-2 for LTQ-OT data. False-positive ratios were estimated using a reverse decoy database. All datasets where searched once in the forward and once in the reverse database. Separate searches were used to keep the database size constant. Protein and peptide score were then set up to maintain the false positive peptide ratio below 1%. Briefly, intensities of reporter tags of the peptides were corrected in term of isotopic distribution of each tag and normalized according to the total signal of each tag to correct any difference in the amount of each tagged sample. Finally, relative intensity of each reporter was calculated by dividing it by each peptide tags sum. Indeed, the different peptides of a single protein show variable intensities depending on the physic-chemical properties. This normalization allows thus making comparable all the peptides of a given protein each other.

Unfortunately, efforts toward a high-resolution structure of full-length apoA-I have not been fruitful, though there have been successes with deletion mutants. Recently, a C-terminal truncation (apoA-IΔ185-243) was crystallized as a dimer. The structure showed two helical bundles connected by a long, curved pair of swapped helical domains. To compare this structure to that existing under solution conditions, we applied small angle X-ray scattering and isotope-assisted chemical cross-linking to apoA-IΔ185-243 in its dimeric and monomeric forms. For the dimer, we found evidence for the shared domains and aspects of the N-terminal bundles, but not the molecular curvature seen in the crystal. We also found that the N-terminal bundles equilibrate between open and closed states. Interestingly, this movement is one of the transitions proposed during lipid binding. The monomer was consistent with a model in which the long shared helix doubles back onto the helical bundle. Combined with the crystal structure, these data offer an important starting point to understand the molecular details of HDL biogenesis.

As a single incorrect cross-link identification may lead to an erroneous model, a manual post-validation of the search engine results, at the MS/MS level, was independently performed by two experienced analysts.	2017-05-26	"[[""DOI:10.1074/jbc.M115.706093"",""PMID:26755744""]]"

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) can contribute to this equilibrium of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and thereby antagonize the oncogenic activities of tyrosine kinases, therefore, PTPs are prominently considered to act as tumor suppressors. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the protein-protein interaction network for this PTP family, we isolated the ~ 70 PTP-associated protein complexes from HEK293T cells and provided a systematically proteomic analysis for this tumor suppressor family.

Principal component analysis clearly distinguished adenomas from normal mucosal samples, and cancer cell lines from HCEC cells. Two hundred twelve (212) proteins displayed significant expression changes in adenomatous tissues in comparison with normal mucosa samples (q-value < 0.02, mean fold change vs. normal mucosa  +/-1.4). These proteomic data showed correlation (r=0.7) with transcriptomic data from our previous studies. One-fourth of these proteins (51) had similar expression changes in colorectal cancer cells (vs. HCEC cells) and were therefore confidently attributed to the epithelial component of adenomas. Although benign, adenomas already displayed cancer-associated proteomic changes since the vast majority (91%) of the 76 upregulated proteins in these lesions have been previously reported in cancer. Validation studies were performed on one of the most significantly upregulated proteins, sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD), a key enzyme in the polyol pathway. SORD concentrations and activity were dramatically increased in adenomas and cancer cell lines, where important changes were also noted in the expression of other enzymes in the same (AKR1B1) and related (KHK) pathways. Dysregulation of the polyol pathway may represent a novel aspect/facet of the metabolome remodelling associated with tumorigenesis.	2014-04-03	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:24567419""]]"

As many archaeological sites before Mongolia's Iron Age suffer from a dearth of occupational materials, looking to biomolecular markers of dietary intake can open new investigational avenues into ancient economies. In this case, we use a previously established method of extracting proteins from calculus to explore the consumption of dairy products at LBA Khirigsuur sites in northern Mongolia's Hovsgol Aimag. Seven of nine individual's calculus contained peptides from the whey protein Beta-lactoglobulin from Ovis, Capra hircus, Bos, and general Bovidae species.  Aside from proteomics, these and 16 other individuals from the site were analysed for aDNA. We found that 18 of the 20 were primarily from one genetic ancestral group, and Ancient North Eurasian (ANE). One of the outliers represents a combination of ANE and Western Steppe Herder (WSH), with the other a combination of ANE and Eastern Asian (EE). This finding, while important in its own right, evidences the earliest known dairy consumption in Mongolia, and supports a widely held assumption that pastoralism was a primary subsistence strategy in the ancient Eastern Steppes. The combined proteomic and DNA evidence suggest that Western Steppe dairy animals and technology entered Mongolia before genetic admixture.

Not only does the technology allow for the simultaneous quantification of multiple samples in a single MS injection, but its seamless compatibility with extensive sample pre-fractionation methods allow for comprehensive study of complex proteomes. However, reporter ion based quantification has often been criticized for limited quantification accuracy due to interference from co-eluting peptides and peptide fragments. In this study, we investigate the extent of this problem and propose an effective and easy-to-implement remedy relying on spiking a 6-protein calibration mixture to the samples subject to relative quantification. Our ratio adjustment approach was evaluated on a large scale TMT 10-plex dataset derived from cancer cell lines with chromosome instability. Furthermore, we analyzed a complex 2-proteome artificial sample mixture and investigated the precision of TMT and precursor ion intensity based Label Free Quantification. Comparing the two methods we observed that the isobaric tag based quantification workflow, due to its superior precision, was able to confirm more and smaller protein abundance changes, at a fixed False Positive Rate.

The mgf files were searched, using Mascot (Matrix Science, Version 2.4.0), against a concatenated target-decoy database including forward and reversed sequences of the protein entries included in the of the following databases; Homo sapiens (SwissProt, www.uniprot.org, release date 30/10/2014, 20625 target sequences), Bartonella henselae (SwissProt, www.uniprot.org, release date 1/06/2013, 1466 target sequences), a custom made database containing the six Calibration-mix Proteins (uniprot accession numbers: P00489,  P02789,  P01012,  P02666,  P00722,  B6V3I5, www.uniprot.org downloaded 22/10/2014) and a set of commonly observed contaminants (381 target sequences provided by the MaxQuant software suit, version 1.0.13.13). The Mascot search criteria were set as follows: 10 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance, 0.02 Da fragment ion mass tolerance, full tryptic specificity required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues unless followed by proline), maximum 2 missed cleavages, fixed modifications: carbamidomethylation (C) and TMT6plex (K and peptide n-terminus), variable modification: oxidation (M). The database search results were post-processed using the Scaffold Q+ software (version 4.3.2, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR). Here, protein scores were calculated using the Protein Prophet algorithm {Nesvizhskii:2003kr}. Next, peptide and protein level identifications were filtered to achieve a maximum False Discovery Rate of 1%, on both levels. The FDR was determined using the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters.  TMT reporter ion intensities were extracted using Scaffold Q+. Protein relative quantification was performed using our in-house developed SafeQuant R package {Glatter:2012ki}. This analysis included multiple steps; adjustment of reporter ion intensities for isotopic impurities according to the manufacturer’s instructions, global data normalization by equalizing the total reporter ion intensity across all channels, summation of reporter ion intensities per protein and channel, calculation of protein abundance ratios and testing for differential abundance using empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics{Smyth:2004cf}. Note that when analyzing the 2-proteome mix dataset global normalization factors were derived from the H.sapiens data subset.	2015-12-15	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:27345528""]]"

Due to their histologic and morphologic similarity, differential diagnosis between CCC and metastasis of PDAC located in the liver frequently proves an unsolvable issue for pathologists. Biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity for the differentiation of these tumour types would therefore be a valuable tool, but so far none are available. Here, we address this problem by comparing microdissected CCC and PDAC tumour cells in a label-free proteomics approach. The novel biomarker candidates were subsequently verified by immunohistochemical staining of primary and secondary tumour tissue.

285	PXD008311	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008311	The impact of oncogenic EGFRvIII on the proteome of extracellular vesicles (exosomes) released from glioblastoma cells	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous form of primary brain tumors, driven by a complex repertoire of oncogenic alterations, including the constitutively active epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII). EGFRvIII impacts both cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous aspects of GBM progression, including cell invasion, angiogenesis and modulation of the tumor microenvoiront, this is, at least in part, attributable to the release and intercellular trafficking of extracellular vesicles (EVs), heterogeneous membrane structures containing multiple bioactive macromolecules. Here we analyzed the impact of EGFRvIII on the profile of glioma EVs using a series of isogenic tumor cell lines, in which this oncogene exhibits a strong transforming activity. Thus, we observed that EGFRvIII expression alters several properties of glioma EVs, including their output and global protein composition. Using mass spectrometry, quantitative proteomic analysis and Gene Ontology terms filters, we observed that EVs released by EGFRVIII-transformed cells were enriched for extracellular exosome and focal adhesion related proteins. Among them, we validated the association of pro-invasive proteins (CD44, BSG, CD151) with EVs of EGFRvIII expressing cells, and down-regulation of exosomal markers (CD81 and CD82) in EVs of their indolent counterparts. Nano-flow cytometry revealed that the EV output from individual glioma cell lines was highly heterogeneous, such that only a fraction of EVs contained specific proteins such as EGFR, CD9, or others. Notably, cells expressing EGFRvIII released ample EVs double positive for CD44/BSG, and these proteins also co-localized in cellular filopodia. We also detected the expression of homophilic adhesion molecules and increased homologous EV uptake by EGFRvIII-positive glioma cells. These results suggest that oncogenic EGFRvIII reprograms the proteome of GBM-related EVs, a notion with considerable implications for their biological activity and properties relevant for development of EV-based cancer biomarkers.

We improved the precision and accuracy of peptide-ion intensity based quantification in order to enable accurate determination of protein turnover in non-dividing cells using dynamic-SILAC. This enabled precise and accurate protein half-life determination ranging from 10 to more than 1000 hours. We achieve good proteomic coverage ranging from four to six thousand proteins in several types of non-dividing cells, corresponding to a total of 9699 unique proteins over the entire dataset. Good agreement was observed in half-lives between B-cells, natural killer cells and monocytes, while hepatocytes and mouse embryonic neurons showed substantial differences.  Our comprehensive dataset enabled extension and statistical validation of the previous observation that subunits of protein complexes tend to have coherent turnover. Furthermore, we observed complex architecture dependent turnover within complexes of the proteasome and the nuclear pore complex. Our method is broadly applicable and might be used to investigate protein turnover in various cell types.

However, the corresponding selection is often not based on a fit-for-purpose evaluation. Here we report a comparison of in-gel (IGD), in-solution (ISD), on-filter (OFD), and on-pellet digestion (OPD) workflows on the basis of targeted (QconCAT-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method for mitochondrial proteins) and discovery proteomics (data dependent acquisition, DDA) analyses using three different human head and neck tissues (i.e. nasal polyps, parotid gland, and palatine tonsils). Our study reveals differences between the sample preparation methods, for example with respect to protein and peptide losses, quantification variability, protocol-induced methionine oxidation and asparagine/glutamine deamidation as well as identification of cysteine containing peptides. Moreover, none of the methods performed best for all types of tissues, which seemingly argues against the existence of a universal sample preparation method for proteome analysis.

Raw data for the targeted proteomics analyses were processed using the Skyline software (version 3.5), and were furthermore analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2013 (more details on processing of targeted proteomics data have been published previously21). Shotgun proteomics data were processed using PEAKS Studio software (version 8.0)32, and peak lists were searched against the UniProtKB homo sapiens ‘UP000005640’ reference proteome (canonical; 70956 entries; downloaded on December 15, 2016) with trypsin selected as proteinase (≤ 3 missed cleavages), cysteine carbamidomethylation as fixed modification, methionine oxidation as variable oxidation, and allowing ≤ 6 modifications per peptide, ≤ 10.0 ppm precursor mass deviation (using monoisotopic mass), ≤ 0.2 Da fragment ion deviation, and ≤ 1.0% false discovery rates (FDR) for peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), proteins and peptides for the principal analyses. For evaluation of cysteine carbamidomethylation efficiency, this modification was set to variable; for assessment of protocol-induced asparagine and glutamine deamidation, the corresponding modification was added as variable modification; and any further modification assessment was based on PEAKS PTM (including all 485 built-in modifications) and SPIDER searches on spectra with de novo ALC (Average Local Confidence) scores greater than 15%. Label-free quantification using ion counts was performed on the basis of the results of the principal PEAKS search, as described above, followed by further filtering and processing of the data using an in-house developed script in R (version 3.4.0) and R Studio (version 1.0.143). With respect to peptide quantification, peptide areas were summed for peptides with corresponding primary amino acid sequence thus including all PTMs and charge states. For protein quantification, areas of peptides belonging to the same protein group were summed, yet only if they were unique for the corresponding protein group. For both peptide and protein quantification, DDA data was scaled by median scale normalization. Bioinformatics analysis. Data analysis was performed using R, R studio, Microsoft Excel, and GraphPad Prism (version 5.00). For assessment of (relative) recovery and precision, peptides and proteins that were measured in all 20 samples originating from the same tissue (four sample preparation approaches, five replicates per approach) were included, and average levels as well as coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for every approach, of which the latter values were used for evaluating the precision of the sample preparation method. For every peptide/protein, the highest average quantity was set to 100% and the other three average quantities were related to this maximum value thereby obtaining relative peptide/protein levels which were used for evaluation of the recovery of the sample preparation approaches. Assessment of the discovery potential for each of the sample preparation methods was based on comparing the amounts of proteins and peptides identified (in three out of five, four out of five, and five out of five replicates) per method as well as based on comparisons of the trypsin cleavage efficiencies, the fractions of cysteine-containing peptides (relative to the total number of peptides), methionine oxidized peptides (relative to the total number of methionine containing peptides), and asparagine and/or glutamine deamidated peptides (relative to the total number of asparagine and/or glutamine containing peptides) for each method. Furthermore, relevant modifications as pointed out by the PEAKS PTM and SPIDER searches were included as well. Comparisons of the selected physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight (MW), isoelectric point (pI), and hydrophobicity, expressed as grand average of hydropathy (GRAVY) scores calculated using the method of Kyte & Doolittle27) of the proteins and peptides identified in at least three out of five replicates per sample preparation method were enabled by using the R “Peptides” package (version 2.2, 2017-06-05). For visualization of the corresponding data, density plots were obtained using the R “ggplot2” package (version 2.2.1.9000, 2016-12-30).	2017-12-19	"[[""DOI:10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00600"",""PMID:29608294""]]"

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.

Search parameters allowed trypsin to cleave after Lysine and Arginine and have 2 missed cleavages.  Precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 15 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance was 20 mmu.  The dynamic modification of methionine (oxidation = 15.995 Da) and lysine (13C6 = 6.020 Da), in addition to the static modification of cysteine (carbamidomethylation = 57.021 Da) was accepted on up to 4 residues per peptide.  Within the Proteome Discoverer Software, SILAC pairs were identified using the �2 plex� workflow node, and all peptides were rescored using the Percolator algorithm node.  Finally, peptides were filtered at 1% false discovery rate (FDR).

While transcriptomic experiments enable the detection of many alternatively spliced transcripts, it is not known if these transcripts have protein-coding potential. We recently published the PG Nexus pipeline, which facilitates high confidence validation of exons and exon-exon junctions of spliced transcripts by integrating transcriptomics and proteomics data. Using the PG Nexus, we analyzed undifferentiated human mesenchymal stem cells and compared the number of protein isoforms validated using different protein sequence database, including public online databases and RNA-seq derived databases. With significant overlaps with other databases, we identified 8,011 exons and 3,824 splice junctions with the Ensembl database. Both exonic and junction peptides were important for protein isoform validation. The Ensembl database consistently outperformed the other data sources, but predicted open reading frames from RNA-seq derived transcripts were comparable, with only 6 less splice junctions validated. Using proteotypic and isoform-specific peptides, we validated 462 protein isoforms. This number increases to 1,083 if multiple proteotypic peptides per protein are included. Multiplexing proteotypic peptides in SRM assays or similar experiments will increase the confidence and coverage of protein isoform validation experiments.

MS and MS/MS were performed using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) hybrid linear ion trap and Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Survey scans m/z 350–2000 were acquired in the Orbitrap (resolution = 30 000 at m/z 400, with an initial accumulation target value of 1,000,000 ions in the linear ion trap; lock mass applied to polycyclodimethylsiloxane background ions of exact m/z 445.1200 and 429.0887). MS/MS was performed via collision induced dissociation (CID) with an activation q = 0.25, an activation time of 30 ms, normalized collision energy of 30% and at a target value of 10 000 ions; fragment ions were mass analyzed in the linear ion trap. To increase the depth of proteome coverage, each proteolytic peptide sample was subjected to 5 rounds of LC-MS/MS. In the first round, up to the 15 most abundant ions (>5000 counts) with charge states of >+2 were sequentially isolated and fragmented via CID. The 4 subsequent rounds were performed using MS/MS exclusion lists, in conjunction with the data-dependent acquisition parameters employed in the first round. Specifically for each sample analysed in rounds 2 to 5 of LC-MS/MS, m/z values and retention times associated with ions selected for MS/MS in any previous round were incorporated into an MS/MS exclusion list; these ions were excluded from further MS/MS analysis using mass and retention time tolerances of ±10 ppm and ±1.5 min respectively. Day-to-day fluctuations in retention times were determined using a peptide standard mixture, and when necessary, these data were used to apply retention time corrections to exclusion lists.	2014-10-31	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:25961807""]]"

The cancer sectretome, the collection of all macromolecules secreted by a tumor cell, alters its composition compared to normal tissue, and this change plays an important role in the observation of cancer progression. The collection and accurate analysis of cancer secretomes could lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers, thus improving outcomes of cancer treatment. We unexpectedly discovered that enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA) of a D-peptide hydrogelator results in nanonets/hydrogel around cancer cells that overexpress ectophosphatases. Here we show that these nanonets are able to rapidly collect proteins in the pericellular space (i.e., near the surface) of cancer cells. Because the secretory substances are at their highest concentration near the cell surface, the use of pericellular nanonets to collect the cancer secretome maximizes the yield and quality of samples, reduces pre-analytical variations, and allows the dynamic profiling of secretome samples. Thus, this new approach has great potential in identifying the heterotypic signaling in tumor microenvironments thereby improving the understanding of tumor microenvironments and accelerating the discovery of potential biomarkers in cancer biology.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

In order to assess whether insulin resistance affects the proteins involved in lipid metabolism, we used two mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics techniques to compare the intestinal proteome of 14 IR patients to that of 16 insulin sensitive (IS) control patients matched for age and waist circumference. A total of 3896 proteins were identified by the iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) mass spectrometry approach and 2311 by the SWATH-MS strategy (Serial Window Acquisition of Theoretical Spectra). Using these two methods, 208 common proteins were identified with a confidence corresponding to FDR < 1%, and quantified with p-value < 0.05. The quantification of those 208 proteins has a Pearson correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.728 across the two techniques. Gene Ontology analyses of the differentially expressed proteins revealed that annotations related to lipid metabolic process and oxidation reduction process are overly represented in the set of under-expressed proteins in IR subjects. Furthermore, both methods quantified proteins of relevance to IR. These data also showed that SWATH-MS is a promising and compelling alternative to iTRAQ for protein quantitation of complex mixtures.

While the transcriptional network of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has been extensively studied, relatively little is known about how post-transcriptional modulations determine hESC function. RNA-binding proteins play central roles in RNA regulation, including translation and turnover. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 is highly expressed in hESCs to maintain their undifferentiated state and prevent default neural fate. Notably, loss of CSDE1 accelerates neural differentiation and potentiates neurogenesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of CSDE1 impairs neural differentiation. We find that CSDE1 post-transcriptionally modulates core components of multiple regulatory nodes of hESC identity, neuroectoderm commitment and neurogenesis. Among these key pro-neural/neuronal factors, CSDE1 binds fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) and vimentin (VIM) mRNAs as well as transcripts involved in neuron projection development regulating their stability and translation. Thus, our results uncover CSDE1 as a central post-transcriptional regulator of hESC identity and neurogenesis.

As a result, complete and accurate characterization of human bone proteome is yet to be performed, and as a result, several bone-related diseases such as craniosynostosis and osteosarcoma are still poorly understood. We sought to develop a reproducible method for extracting whole proteins of varying molecular weights from human cranial bone. Whole protein was extracted from human cranial suture by mechanically processing samples using a method that minimized heat introduction to proteins to limit degradation. Western blotting suggests the presence of whole protein while mass spectrometry was used to sequence peptides and identify isolated proteins. Molecular weights of extracted protein ranged from 9.4-629 kDa and contained proteins of both intra- and extra-cellular origin. High correlation scores among suture protein spectral counts suggest the reproducibility of the method. Ontology analytics revealed proteins of myriad functions including mediators of metabolic processes and cell organelles. These results suggest a reproducible method for isolation of whole protein representing a large range of molecular weights, origins and functions.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.

Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).	2017-01-17	"[[""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201600300"",""PMID:28195392""]]"

We developed a discovery-validation mass-spectrometry based pipeline to identify a set of proteins that are regulated in serum of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and squamous cell cervical cancer using isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ®), label-free shotgun and targeted mass-spectrometric quantification. At the discovery stage we used a “pooling” strategy for the comparative analysis of immunodepleted serum from patients with early-(CES) and late-stage (CLS) cervical cancer versus healthy controls that revealed 15 up- and 26 down-regulated proteins. The analysis of a new of non-depleted serum samples from patients with CIN, CES, CLS, and healthy controls showed significant changes in abundance of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1, alpha-1-antitrypsin, serotransferrin, haptoglobin, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein and vitamin D-binding protein. To further validate our findings we developed a fast UPLC/MRM method for the simultaneous targeted quantification of these proteins in a new set of 48 CIN, 50 CES, 34 CLS and 48 healthy controls as well as 49 serum samples from patients with ovarian cancer. The panel of six proteins showed 62% sensitivity and 82 % specificity for discrimination of patients with CIN grade 2 or worse from healthy controls, a stage of the disease where current protein-based biomarkers fail to show any discrimination.

All MS/MS data were analyzed using Phenyx (GeneBio, Geneva, Switzerland) and X!Tandem (The GPM, thegpm.org; version CYCLONE (2010.12.01.1)). Phenyx was setup to search the uniprot swissprot database (selected for Homo sapiens, Release 2012_08 of 05-Sep-12, 20231 sequences) setting the digestion enzyme to trypsin. A fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.30 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 50 ppm were selected for a database search. Iodoacetamide derivatization of cysteine and 4-plex iTRAQ derivatization  of lysine and the N-terminus were specified as fixed modifications; oxidation of methionine was specified in Phenyx as a variable modification. X!Tandem database search was performed in the Scaffold 3.6.2 (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) environment on the subsequent protein database (proteins identified with Phenyx database search) to extend the search space by taking the following variable modifications into account: amidation of the C-terminus, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of histidine, methionine and tryptophan, acetylation of lysine and the N-terminus and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine.  Scaffold 3.6.2 was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they had a probability of greater than 95.0 % as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they had a probability of greater than 95.0 %. as specified by the Protein Prophet algorithm. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony (a minimum set of proteins that accounts for all detected peptides is reported).	2014-06-09	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:25232869""]]"

However, challenges to achieve similar response in patients harboring solid tumour are still considerable. To achieve anti-tumor efficacy, these cells must survive, expand and persist after infusion into patients. An important lesson has been derived from clinical trials using CAR technologies: the relevance of the CAR design to enhance signaling and sustain T cell proliferation and survival.  Here, we prove that third generation CARs specific for GD2 antigen incorporating CD28.4-1BB costimulatory domains improves T cell immunotherapy in a neuroblastoma (NB) pre-clinical model, as compared to a CAR with the same specificity but including CD28.OX40 costimulation. Indeed, we test the anti-tumor activity of polyclonal T cells genetically modified with third generation CAR.GD2 incorporating either CD28.4-1BB or CD28.OX40 in frame with the safety switch inducible Caspase 9 (iC9). We prove a significant in vitro and in vivo amelioration of the approach by the presence of 4.1BB signaling in terms of: 1) less T cell exhaustion, 2) lower basal T cell activation, 3) higher in vivo tumor control and 4) T cell persistence. In addition, the fine tuning of T cell culture conditions with the use of IL7 and IL15 show to be synergic with the third generation CAR.GD2 design to optimize CAR T immunotherapy for NB. Our results provide a proof-of-concept for the need to optimize not only CAR construct design but also T cell culture conditions in order to boost T cell activity in vivo.

We compared the cervicovaginal proteome as characterised by mass-spectrometry of four groups of African female sex workers (total N=50) grouped by microbiome composition as characterised by 16S rDNA microarray.  Group 1 had a Lactobacillus crispatus-dominated microbiome, group 2 a L. iners-dominated microbiome, and groups 3 and 4 had a microbiome containing multiple genera of anaerobic bacteria, with group 3 representing transition to or from dysbiosis and group 4 full dysbiosis. 82 human proteins were differentially abundant among the groups, either showing an increasing or decreasing trend from microbiome groups 1 to 4. Proteins that increased included proteasome subunits and other proteins involved in catabolic metabolism, actin organising proteins and proteins involved in the immune response. Proteins that decreased included antiproteases, keratins, and cornified envelope proteins. We also compared the abundance of pre-defined proteins of interest among microbiome groups: markers of cell type, inflammation, and cell death, and mucins. The dysbiotic groups had increased abundance of proteins unique to lymphocytes and macrophages, pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell death markers, and MUC5B. We conclude that the cervicovaginal human proteome is associated with the cervicovaginal microbiome in a dose-response manner. The changes are likely caused by a pro-inflammatory influx of immune cells and an increase of cell death in dysbiosis. Dysbiosis-associated immune activation, breaches in epithelial integrity, altered mucin balance, and altered protease-antiprotease balance may all contribute to the increased risk of HIV transmission when cervicovaginal dysbiosis is present.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

315	PXD001174	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001174	Un-conditioned commercial embryo culture media contain a large variety of non-declared proteins: a comprehensive proteomics analysis	Study question: Which non-declared proteins (proteins not listed on the composition list of the product data sheet) are present in unconditioned commercial embryo culture media?  Summary answer: A total of 110 non-declared proteins were identified in unconditioned media and between 6 and 8 of these were quantifiable.   What is known already: There are no data in the literature on what non-declared proteins are present in un-conditioned (fresh media in which no embryos have been cultured) commercial embryo media.  Study design, size, duration: The following eight commercial embryo culture media were included in this study: G-1 PLUS and G-2 PLUS G5 Series from Vitrolife, Sydney IVF Cleavage Medium and Sydney IVF Blastocyst Medium from Cook Medical and EmbryoAssist, BlastAssist, Sequential Cleav and Sequential Blast from ORIGIO. Two batches were analysed for each of the Sydney IVF media and one batch from each of the other media. All embryo culture media are supplemented by the manufacturers with purified human serum albumin (HSA 5 mg/ml). The purified HSA (HSA-solution from Vitrolife) and the recombinant human albumin supplement (G-MM from Vitrolife) were also analysed.   Participants/materials, setting, methods: For protein quantification, media samples were in-solution digested with trypsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For in-depth protein identification, media were albumin depleted, dialyzed and concentrated before sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was cut into 14 slices followed by in-gel trypsin digestion, and analysis by LC-MS/MS. Proteins were further investigated using gene ontology (GO) terms analysis.  Main results and the role of chance: Using advanced mass spectrometry and high confidence criteria for accepting proteins (p< 0.01), a total of 110 proteins other than HSA were identified. The average serum albumin content was found to be 94% (92% - 97%) of total protein. Other individual proteins accounted for up to 4.7% of the total protein. Analysis of purified HSA strongly suggests that these non-declared proteins are introduced to the media when the albumin is added. GO analysis showed that many of these proteins have roles in defence pathways, for example 18 were associated with the innate immune response and 17 with inflammatory responses. Eight proteins have been reported previously as secreted embryo proteins.  Limitations, reasons for caution: For six of the commercial embryo culture media only one batch was analyzed. However, this does not affect the overall conclusions.  Wider implications of the findings: The results showed that the HSA added to IVF media contained many other proteins and that the amount varies from batch to batch. These variations in protein profiles are problematic when attempting to identify proteins derived from the embryos. Therefore, when studying the embryo secretome and analysing conditioned media with the aim of finding potential biomarkers that can distinguish normal and abnormal embryo development, it is important that the medium used in the experimental and control groups is from the same batch. Furthermore, the proteins present in un-conditioned media could potentially influence embryonic development, gestation age, birthweight and perhaps have subsequent effects on health of the offspring.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

Several classical inflammatory agonists were found induced, including PGA2, PGB2, PGE2 and TXB2, but also modulators such as PGA3 and PGE3, while 8-HETE and several HODE family members remained unaffected. Using targeted metabolomics, several acylcarnithins, phosphatitylcholins and sphingomyelins were found significantly downregulated. Proteome profiling with orbitrap-MS demonstrated the strong induction of several chemokines, metalloproteinases and other effector molecules. Treatment of stimulated fibroblasts with dexamethasone almost completely abrogated the formation of all inflammation-induced eicosanoids and restored levels of acylcarnithins back to normal. As expected, the secretion of IL-6, MMP1, MMP3, CXCL2 and CXCL3 was strongly down-regulated. However, instead of counter-regulating, dexamethasone further enhanced consequences of inflammatory stimulation with respect to CXCL1, CXCL6, complement C3 as well as sphingomyelins. Shotgun secretome data were confirmed by targeted analysis with triple-quadrupol-MS. These molecules have been described to be involved in chronic inflammation. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, actually dexamethasone successfully downregulated the formation of all detectable inflammation mediators. The present data suggest that successful pharmacological abrogation of the formation of lipid inflammatory mediators in fibroblasts may not suffice to suppress the release of several other powerful inflammatory mediators which we thus understand to be capable of establishing chronic inflammation states.

319	PXD008440	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008440	The response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to 5-fluorouracil in locally advanced colorectal cancer patients: a predictive proteomic signature.	Background: Colorectal cancer is the third most common and the fourth most lethal cancer in the world. In the majority of cases, patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage or even metastatic, thus explaining the high mortality. The standard protocol for treating patients with locally advanced non-metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy (NRCT) with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), but the resistance rate to this treatment remains high with approximately 30% of non-responders. The lack of evidence available in clinical practice to predict NRCT resistance to 5-FU and to guide clinical practice therefore encourages the search for biomarkers of this resistance. Methods: From twenty-three formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies performed before NRCT with 5-FU of locally advanced non-metastatic CRC patients, we extracted and analysed the tumor proteome of these patients. From clinical data, we were able to classify the twenty-two patients in our cohort into three treatment response groups: non-responders (NR), partial responders (PR) and total responders (TR), and to compare the proteomes of these different groups.  Results: We have highlighted 384 differentially expressed proteins between NR and PR, 248 between NR and TR and 417 between PR and TR. Among these proteins, we have identified many differentially expressed proteins identified as having a role in cancer (IFIT1, FASTKD2, PIP4K2B, ARID1B, SLC25A33: overexpressed in TR; CALD1, CPA3, B3GALT5, CD177, RIPK1: overexpressed in NR). We have also identified that DPYD, the main degradation enzyme of 5-FU, was overexpressed in NR, as well as several ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins also overexpressed in NR.  Conclusions: From these retrospective study, we implemented a protein extraction protocol from FFPE biopsy to highlight protein differences between different response groups to RCTN with 5-FU in patients with locally advanced non-metastatic CRC. These results will pave the way for a larger cohort for better sensitivity and specificity of the signature to guide decisions in the choice of treatment.

Data were processed, searched and quantified using the MaxQuant software package employing the Human Uniprot database [15]. The following settings were used for the MaxQuant analysis: 2 miscleavages allowed; fixed modification was carbamidomethylation on cysteine; enzyme was trypsin (K/R not before P); variable modifications included in the analysis were methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation; mass tolerance of 7 ppm for precursor ions and 20 ppm for fragment ions. The analysis of mass spectrometry data were next carried out with the Perseus software [16] and subjected to a normalization (z-score) and an ANOVA statistical test (comparison of the three groups) or Student’s T-test (comparison of two groups), both corrected with a p-value of 0.05.  Statistical analysis.  The different groups of patients were first compared according to clinicopathological parameters. Due to a small number of patients per group, Fisher's exact test was done with the R software [17]. When the p-value was less than 0.05, the result was considered to have statistical significance.	2017-12-13	"[[""DOI:10.1186/s12014-018-9192-2"",""PMID:29681787""]]"

Spectral matches were filtered to contain less than 1% FDR at the peptide level based on the target-decoy method. Finally, only tryptic matches were reported and spectral matches were manually examined. When peptides matched to multiple proteins, the peptide was assigned so that only the most logical protein was included (Occam’s razor). However, when comparing the results from WT and KO cells, the shared peptides were considered into all possible proteins. This same principle was used for isoforms when present in the database. The PD output files were further processed by Scaffold 4.6.1 to ensure the protein FDR is less than 1%.	2016-10-06	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.M116.064543"",""PMID:28174230""]]"

To understand Treg identity, we compared by proteomics and transcriptomics human naïve (n) and effector (e)Tregs, Tconvs and transitional FOXP3+ cells. Only 12% of 422 differentially expressed proteins was identified as such at the mRNA level, demonstrating the importance of direct proteome measurement. Fifty-one proteins discriminated Tregs from Tconvs. This common Treg protein signature indicates altered signaling by TCR-, TNF receptor-, NFB-, PI3 kinase/mTOR-, NFAT- and STAT pathways, and unique cell biological and metabolic features. Another protein signature uniquely identified eTregs and revealed active cell division, apoptosis sensitivity and suppression of NFB- and STAT signaling. eTreg fate appears consolidated by FOXP3 outnumbering its partner transcription factors. These features explain why eTregs cannot produce inflammatory cytokines, whereas transitional FOXP3+ cells can. Collectively, our data reveal that Treg identity is defined and protected by uniquely “wired” signaling pathways.

Peptides were identified using the Andromeda search engine by querying the human Uniprot database (2015-02, 89796 entries) with a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off both at peptide and protein level. Potential contaminants and reverse hits were eliminated using Perseus version 1.5.0.31. To compare proteomes of different cell populations, LFQ values were log2-transformed and the 3 technical replicates per experimental condition grouped. For further analysis, only proteins with 3 valid values in at least one of the groups were included. Missing values were imputed by normal distribution (width= 0.3, shift= 1.8). Intergroup differences in protein levels were calculated using ANOVA using Benjamini Hochberg FDR of 0.05 and S0 0. General relatedness of samples was assessed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Perseus’ built-in tool. Calculation of Pearson’s correlations was assessed using Gitools (version 2.2.3)(Perez-Llamas and Lopez-Bigas, 2011). Clusters of proteins with specific expression patterns were identified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on K-means and Euclidian distance after z-score normalization. Cell type specific clusters were further analyzed for enrichment of functional and biological categories, using STRING and DAVID bioinformatics tools. Pathway diagrams were generated through the use of Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®, QIAGEN). GO biological processes redundancy was removed using REVIGO (Supek et al., 2011).  Absolute protein abundance was estimated using the proteomic ruler approach using a plug-in built in Perseus as described by the authors (Wiśniewski et al., 2014). The abundances were expressed as protein copy numbers and the values were log10 transformed and presented in graphs using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).  Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the geneset collection C3 from the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB v4.0) that contains information about curated-, motif-, transcription factor targets gene sets. The genes that share a transcription factor binding site are defined and annotated by TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2006) (version 7.4).   Protein and RNA comparison The comparison of protein and transcript abundances across cell types was performed as published before (Wilhelm et al., 2014). Briefly, absolute transcript abundances (expressed as fragment per kilobase per million, FPKM) were extracted from the RNA-Seq data. Absolute protein abundance was estimated using the intensity based absolute protein quantification (iBAQ)(Schwanhäusser et al., 2011) approach with few modifications described elsewhere (Wilhelm et al., 2014). Briefly, peptide intensities were summed up and divided by the number of observable peptides per protein. The iBAQ values were then normalized based on the total sum of all protein intensities in order to be able to compare abundances across samples. Proteins were mapped to transcripts using the Uniprot.ws package (Bioconductor) resulting in 4,782 transcripts/proteins with expression data. For the comparison of protein and mRNA abundances, protein and transcript expression of 409 differentially expressed proteins/RNAs was z-score-transformed. All the analyses were performed using R (v 3.2.0).	2017-09-15	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.immuni.2018.04.008"",""PMID:29752063""]]"

In this method, an mRP-C18 column was used to fractionate the proteins from a whole cell lysate of a breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, into 38 fractions. Each fraction was subjected to tryptic digestion, sequential phosphopeptide enrichment by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), followed by capillary RPLC-MS/MS analysis. For comparison, the conventional method of using strong cation exchange (SCX)-RPLC separation of peptides combined with MS/MS was also used for analyzing the phosphoproteome. Replicate experiments by the mRP-RPLC method identified 1585 distinct phosphoproteins with 4519 phosphopeptides, compared to 1585 phosphoproteins with 4297 phosphopeptides by SCX-RPLC, with a total of 1947 phosphoproteins and 6278 phosphopeptides identified from the combined results. While the two methods have similar ability in the identification of the phosphoproteome, they produce complementary information. The phosphoproteins identified in this study, including 67 novel phosphorylation sites from 56 breast cancer related proteins, can serve as the entry point for future validation with biological implications in breast cancer.

One of the hallmarks of AIDP pathogenesis is a significantly elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level in comparison with the peptidome/proteome profile of a representative number of CSF samples obtained from AIDP and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and control patients. In total, 2355 peptide fragments related to 795 proteins were found in CSF samples from AIDP patients, 1066 peptide fragments of 253 proteins in samples from MS patients, and 774 peptide fragments of 220 proteins from control patients. Proteomic studies detected 1103 proteins in the control cohort and 1402 proteins in the AIDP cohort. Our dataset suggests that the proteome of the CSF from AIDP and control patients overlaps by as much as 67%, whereas the peptidome is only 21.5% identical. Comparison of the peptidomic and proteomic data revealed that 80% of the peptides in the CSF of AIDP patients correspond to proteins that are not present in proteomic dataset. Importantly, a considerable number of differentially represented peptides are related to the proteins involved in the arrangement of the axonal domains. The observed peptidomic dataset indicates that specific proteins, which participate in the arrangement of the myelin sheath in the nodes of Ranvier, are degraded in the course of AIDP.  Here, we show that the proteins that are overrepresented in the CSF of AIDP patients are partially linked with defensive responses to bacteria and viruses. These observations are in line with the upregulation of CSF cytokines associated with innate immunity, which in turn surprisingly suggests that the destruction of axons is not accompanied by any indications of a distinct adaptive autoimmune process. We believe that the presented proteomic and peptidomic dataset of the CSF from AIDP patients will provide useful information regarding the mechanisms of AIDP pathogenesis in comparison with MS, which is the prolonged but incurable autoimmune degradation of the central nervous system.

Prior to the log2 transformation, iBAQ values of 0 were replaced with the smallest iBAQ value from the corresponding sample in dCas9-mCherry-APEX2/sgTelo (+BP, -H2O2) (“S2”) or dCas9-mCherry-APEX2/sgNS (+BP, +H2O2) (“S3”) to avoid generation of infinite ratios. Moderated t-test with a paired design was used to compare the log2 transformed iBAQ values between S1 and S3, S1 and S2, and S2 and S3 using limma package. To adjust for multiple comparisons, p values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. Proteins were selected for subsequent analysis if they were (i) significantly enriched in both S1 vs. S3 and S1 vs. S2, (ii) not enriched in S2 vs. S3, and (iii) if S1/S3 and S1/S2 ratios were greater than 2.  Similarly, SILAC datasets were filtered to exclude proteins with H/M ratios detected in only one of the biological replicates. Detection in a biological replicate required identification in at least two of the three technical replicates that were done for each biological replicate; median values from the technical replicates were used for subsequent analyses. Proteins with BH-adjusted p values less than 0.01 (moderated t-test described above) are considered statistically significant. Proteins (with BH-adjusted p values < 0.01 and log2 fold change ≥ 2.5) were selected for subsequent GO (David Bioinformatics) and overlap analysis.

The potential benefits of tissue-specific scaffolds consisting of naturally-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) have been demonstrated using a wide variety of animal and human tissue sources. However, so far, testis scaffolds have never been considered for constructive remodelling purposes. We have therefore developed a protocol for the preparation of cell-free extracellular matrix and characterized the material extensively using a combination of proteomics, immunohistochemsitry, and cell population assays. To prepare cell-free matrix, human cadaveric testicular tissue was exposed for 24 h or 48 h to 1% Triton X-100 and/or 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The extent of decellularization was evaluated by histology. Confirmation of cell removal in DTM was done by a DNA quantification technique. The protein composition was analysed by LC-MS/MS. The retention of testicular tissue-specific characteristics was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, Alcian blue staining and scanning electron microscopy. Soluble toxicity and testicular cell attachment was assessed to check the cytocompatibility of DTM scaffolds.  Histological analysis showed that DTM could be obtained by mechanical agitation in 1% SDS for 24 h. The resulting DTM was found to be clear of cells while retaining the typical three-dimensional structure. Proteomics analysis revelaed the presence of  the major components of the native tissue scaffold, including collagen type I and IV, fibronectin, laminin and glycosaminoglycans. In addition, numerous additional ECM proteins in DTM were detected, indicating its complex nature. Importantly, we demonstrated that DTM scaffolds are not cytotoxic, as evidenced by MTT assay showing a normal fibroblast proliferation activity after indirect exposure, and support testicular cell attachment and infiltration.

Serum has also been employed widely. Only a few studies have assessed the difference and relevance of the proteome profiles obtained from plasma samples, such as EDTA-plasma or lithium-heparin-plasma, and serum. A complete evaluation of the use of EDTA-plasma, heparin-plasma, and serum would greatly expand the comprehensiveness of shotgun proteomics of blood samples. In this study, we evaluated the use of heparin-plasma with respect to EDTA-plasma and serum to profile blood proteomes using a scalable automated proteomic pipeline (ASAP2). The use of plasma and serum for mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics was tested with commercial pooled samples. The proteome coverage consistency and the quantitative performance were compared.

335	PXD006176	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006176	Syntaxin-3 is a Weibel-Palade body localized SNARE protein that regulates Von Willebrand factor secretion from endothelial cells	Endothelial cells store von Willebrand factor (VWF) in rod-shaped secretory organelles, called Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). WPB exocytosis is coordinated by a complex network of Rab GTPases, Rab-effectors and SNARE proteins. We have previously identified STXBP1 as the link between the Rab27A-Slp4-a complex on WPBs and the SNARE proteins syntaxin-2 and -3. In this study we investigate the function of syntaxin-3 in VWF secretion. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) from healthy controls endogenous syntaxin-3 immunolocalized to WPBs. A detailed analysis of BOECs isolated from a patient with variant microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), carrying a homozygous mutation in STX3 (STX3-/-), showed a loss of syntaxin-3 protein and absence of WPB-associated syntaxin-3 immunoreactivity. Ultrastructural analysis revealed no detectable differences in morphology or prevalence of immature or mature WPBs in control versus STX3-/- BOECs. VWF multimer analysis showed normal patterns in plasma of the MVID patient, and media from STX3-/- BOECs, together indicating WPB formation and maturation are unaffected by absence of syntaxin-3. However, a clear defect in Ca2+ and cAMP-mediated VWF secretion was found in the STX3-/- BOECs. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that syntaxin-3 associates with the WPB SNAREs SNAP23 and VAMP8. Our data reveal syntaxin-3 as a novel WPB-associated SNARE controlling VWF secretion and highlight the complex regulation of WPB exocytosis by multiple SNARE complexes.

Samples were grouped per BOEC donor (STX3-/- patient, 4 healthy controls) (5 groups, 3 samples per group) and proteins were filtered for at least 3 valid values in at least one of the 5 groups. Missing values were imputed by normal distribution (width = 0.3, shift = 1.8), assuming these proteins were close to the detection limit. Global changes in protein levels were assessed employing four separate volcano plots where the syntaxin-3 patient BOECs were pair wise compared with the healthy control BOECs (FDR 0.05, S0: 0.4). Proteins with a significantly changed level were defined as proteins with a significantly changed expression in all four pair wise comparisons. References 3.

336	PXD000534	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000534	Identification of novel biomarker candidates for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of cholangiocellular carcinoma - LC-MS Part	The aim of this study was the identification of biomarkers for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC). CCC is a primary cancer which arises from the epithelial cells of the bile ducts and is characterised by high mortality rates due to its late clinical presentation and limited treatment options. Tumorous tissue and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue from eight CCC patients were analysed by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and by mass spectrometry-based label-free proteomics. After data analysis and statistical evaluation of the proteins which were found to be differentially regulated between the two experimental groups (fold change ≥ 1.5; p-value ≤ 0.05), 15 candidate proteins were chosen for verification by immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of 14 patients. This confirmed the significant up-regulation of chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC1), gelsolin (GSN), pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (PKM2), serpin H1, 14-3-3 protein sigma (SFN), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) and tax1-binding protein 3 (Tax1BP3) in tumorous cholangiocytes when compared to normal hepatocytes, whereas fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1) and Betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1 (BHMT) were significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, STIP1 and SFN were able to differentiate between CCC tumour cells and non-tumorous cholangiocytes with a sensitivity of 100% and 86%, respectively and a specificity of 100% in both cases. We therefore conclude that these proteins should be considered as potential diagnostic biomarkers for CCC in an immunohistochemical application. Additional experiments addressing the validation of these novel biomarker candidates are being performed.

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.

In the past decades, the pathogenesis for SAVM was still not elucidated. Here we compared the specimens of four sAVM obtained from surgery and control samples from donations using TMT labeled proteomic study. In our proteomic study, we identified a total of 3101 proteins and 654-proteins were changed in SAVM compares with control, among which 96 proteins were upregulated and 358 proteins were downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that extracellular matrix organization in biological process and integrin binding proteins in molecular function were the most enriched items. Four significant changed proteins (PLG, MPZ, MMP9 and RPL23a) were verified by Western blot. The pathway analysis revealed that the changed proteins in pathways of angiogenesis, focal adhesion and cytoplasmic ribosome likely contributed to SAVM. The protein profile changes identified by our proteomic studies provide a comprehensive understanding of sAVM for us.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

Biomarkers that predict disease outcome at the time of initial diagnosis would aid management of the disease.  Experimental design: Proteins extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embeddded sections were identified either using LC-MALDI MS/MS of tryptic digests or after separation by one- or two-dimensional electrophoresis. A list of potential biomarker candidates, based on proposed associations with prostate cancer, was derived from the 320 identified proteins.  Results: Four of the candidates: annexin A2, peroxiredoxin-1, prostate-specific antigen and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, were examined by Western blotting of extracts of biopsies from men whom there was 10-year disease outcome data. Multiplexed Western blotting using cocktails of antibodies and fluor-labeled detection reagents showed that annexin A2 provided the best prediction of risk of metastatic disease.  Conclusions and clinical relevance:  This pilot study indicates that tumour expression of ANXA2 in diagnostic biopsies of a prostate cancer is predictive for the metastatic potential of that cancer. The potential of protein profiling of each cancer is to lead to an overall reduction in mortality from metastatic prostate cancer as well as reduced treatment associated morbidity.

Here, we demonstrate the adsorption of plasma protein onto BP nanomaterials and the subsequent immune perturbation effect on macrophages. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we discovered that BP nanosheets (BPNSs) were able to bind 23.3 percent of immune proteins from plasma, while BP quantum dots (BPQDs) bound 41.8 percent of immune proteins. In particular, the protein corona dramatically reshaped BP nanomaterial-corona complexes, influenced cellular uptake, activated the NF-κB pathway and even increased cytokine secretion by 2-5-fold. BP nanomaterials induced immunotoxicity and immune perturbation in macrophages in the presence of a plasma corona. These findings offer important insights into the development of safe and effective BP nanomaterial-based therapies.

348	PXD000930	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000930	Naa30 is critically involved in maintaining mitochondrial and Golgi integrity	N-terminal acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes, with emerging roles in regulating protein quality and stoichiometry and targeting and complex formation. The NatC complex is one of the three major N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). Here, we partially defined the in vivo human NatC Nt-acetylome by combining siNAA30 mediated knockdown with positional proteomics. We identified 51 human NatC substrates and expanded our current knowledge on the substrate repertoire of NatC which now includes proteins harboring Met-Leu, Met-Ile, Met-Phe, Met-Trp, Met-Tyr, Met-Trp, Met-Met, Met-His and Met-Lys N-termini. Next to cytosolic proteins, several organellar proteins were identified as NatC substrates. Interestingly, upon Naa30 depletion, the levels of several organellar proteins were reduced, in particular those of mitochondrial proteins. Further, knockdown of Naa30 induced the loss of membrane potential, clearing and fragmentation of mitochondria. Naa30 depletion also led to disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. However, Naa30 depletion did not affect ER morphology, endosome or peroxisome distribution or microtubule and actin cytoskeletal architecture, suggesting that the observed mitochondrial fragmentation and clearance and Golgi scattering are not due to general disruption of organelles or microtubules. In conclusion, NatC Nt-acetylates a large variety of cytosolic and organellar proteins and is essential for cis-Golgi integrity and mitochondrial function.

LC-MS/MS analyses were performed and quantification of the degree of Nt-Ac was performed as described in (3). 13C2D3-acetylation of lysine side-chains, carbamidomethylation of cysteine and methionine oxidation to methionine-sulfoxide were set as fixed modifications for the N-terminal COFRADIC analyses. Variable modifications were 13C2D3-acetylation and acetylation of protein N-termini. Pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine was additionally set as a variable modification. Mass tolerance on precursor ions was set to 10 ppm (with Mascot’s C13 option set to 1) and on fragment ions to 0.5 Da. Endoproteinase semi-Arg-C/P (Arg-C specificity with arginine-proline cleavage allowed) was set as enzyme allowing no missed cleavages. The peptide charge was set to 1+, 2+, 3+ and instrument setting was put to ESI-TRAP. Only peptides that were ranked one, have a minimum amino acid length of seven and scored above the threshold score, set at 99% confidence, were withheld. All quantifications [12C6 L-arginine versus 13C615N4 L-arginine) were carried out using the Mascot Distiller Quantitation Tool (version 2.2.1). Ratios for all peptides were calculated by comparing the XIC peak areas of all matched light versus heavy peptides and all ratios were verified by visual inspection of MS spectra. A distribution of all individual peptide ratios was determined followed robust statistics. Peptides displaying a ratio that was significantly up- or down-regulated (95% confidence interval) were considered affected by the NAA30 knockdown.

We improved the precision and accuracy of peptide-ion intensity based quantification in order to enable accurate determination of protein turnover in non-dividing cells using dynamic-SILAC. This enabled precise and accurate protein half-life determination ranging from 10 to more than 1000 hours. We achieve good proteomic coverage ranging from four to six thousand proteins in several types of non-dividing cells, corresponding to a total of 9699 unique proteins over the entire dataset. Good agreement was observed in half-lives between B-cells, natural killer cells and monocytes, while hepatocytes and mouse embryonic neurons showed substantial differences.  Our comprehensive dataset enabled extension and statistical validation of the previous observation that subunits of protein complexes tend to have coherent turnover. Furthermore, we observed complex architecture dependent turnover within complexes of the proteasome and the nuclear pore complex. Our method is broadly applicable and might be used to investigate protein turnover in various cell types.

In this study, further exploration of the paramagnetic bead-based approach, Single-Pot Solid-Phase-Enhanced Sample Preparation (SP3), is carried out. The SP3 approach was tested in a wide range of experimental scenarios, including: 1. Binding solvents (acetonitrile, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone); 2. Binding pH (acidic vs. neutral/basic); 3. Solvent/lysate ratios (50% - 200%, v/v); 4. Mixing and rinsing conditions (on-rack vs. off-rack rinsing); 5. Enrichment of non-denatured proteins; 6. Enrichment of individual proteins from non-complex mixtures. These results highlight the robust handling of proteins in a broad set of scenarios, while also enabling development of a modified SP3 workflow that offers extended functionality. The modified SP3 approach is used in quantitative in-depth proteome analyses to compare it with commercial paramagnetic bead-based HILIC methods (MagReSyn) and across multiple binding conditions (e.g. pH and solvent during binding). Together, these data reveal the extensive quantitative coverage of the proteome possible with SP3 independent of the binding approach utilized. The results further establish the utility of SP3 for the unbiased handling of peptides and proteins for proteomic applications.

The protein extraction protocol is based on the addition of calcium phosphate to non-adjusted pH human milk. The combination of calcium ions with phosphate results in an effective co-precipitation of caseins. To assess the suitability of this fractionation protocol, the protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, LC-MS/MS and CE analysis. The results evidence a significant decrease in contamination of casein fraction with whey proteins and vice versa compared with the conventional isoelectric precipitation of caseins. In addition, CE fraction collection coupled to LC-MS/MS (off-line coupling) has been successfully applied to the identification of minor proteins in this complex matrix. The methodology presented here constitutes a promising tool to enlarge the knowledge of human milk proteome.

Through a targeted drug screen, we found the recently approved multi-kinase inhibitor midostaurin to have potent activity in several lung cancer cells independent of its intended target, PKC, or a specific genomic marker. To determine the underlying mechanism of action we applied a layered functional proteomics approach and a new data integration method. Using chemical proteomics, we identified multiple midostaurin kinase targets in these cells. Network-based integration of these targets with quantitative tyrosine and global phosphoproteomics data using protein-protein interactions from the STRING database suggested multiple targets are relevant for the mode of action of midostaurin. Subsequent functional validation using RNA interference and selective small molecule probes showed that simultaneous inhibition of TBK1, PDK1 and AURKA was required to elicit midostaurin’s cellular effects. Immunoblot analysis of downstream signaling nodes showed that combined inhibition of these targets altered PI3K/AKT and cell cycle signaling pathways that in part converged on PLK1. Furthermore, rational combination of midostaurin with the more potent PLK1 inhibitor BI2536, which is in advanced clinical trials, elicited strong synergy. Our results demonstrate that combination of complementary functional proteomics approaches and subsequent network-based data integration can reveal novel insight into the complex mode of action of multi-kinase inhibitors, actionable targets for drug discovery and cancer vulnerabilities. Finally, we illustrate how this knowledge can be utilized for the rational design of synergistic drug combinations with high potential for clinical translation.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

The use of biomarkers in stroke might have a major impact in patients’ management, both in the diagnosis and the prognosis. Thus, the analysis of the brain proteome is a straightforward approach for the identification of specific biomarkers and for the detection of potential new therapeutic targets for neuroprotection or recovery strategies.  In this study, post-mortem brain slices from ischemic stroke patients were obtained corresponding to infarcted (IC) and contralateral (CL) areas. By means of laser microdissection, neurons and blood brain barrier structures (BBB) were isolated and analyzed in a label-free manner on a LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro MS following a gas phase fractionation approach for precursor ion selection. Ninety one proteins were identified only in neurons, 261 proteins only in BBB and 260 proteins in both cell types (peptides≥2). Gene ontology analyses revealed the alteration of metabolic processes after brain ischemia and also changes regarding catalytic activity and binding. Antioxidant activity and enzyme regulator activity appeared as cell-specific altered molecular functions. A total of 25 proteins showing p<0.05 and fold-change>|2| between IC and CL areas were considered significant in this study: 11 in neurons, 11 in BBB and 3 in both cell types. Twelve of these proteins were selected as candidates and analyzed by immunohistochemistry in independent brains. The MS findings were verified for neuronal SAHH2 and SRSF1 and for EAA2 in both cell types.

In this study, neurons and BBB samples were considered as independent experiments and were analyzed separately. Each GPF range was analyzed independently and all MS runs were automatically aligned to an automatically selected reference sample with manual supervision and were automatically normalized to all features. Label-free protein abundance quantification was based on the sum of the peak areas within the isotope boundaries found in MS of unique peptides for that particular protein. Only non-conflicting features within 400 to 1,500 m/z range, 20 to 80 min retention time and with positive charges between 2 to 7 were considered for quantification. The complete peak list of each GPF range was exported for peptide searching by using Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, UK). Protein identification was done using SwissProt-human database (January 2014), setting precursor mass tolerance to 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance to 0.6 Da. Oxidized methionine was considered as variable amino acid modification together with carbamidomethylation of cysteines as fixed modification. Trypsin was selected as the enzyme allowing up to one missed cleavage. Significant threshold for protein identification was set to p<0.05, with a minimum ion score of 17 and at least 2 hits.  Finally, the 4 GPF ranges were combined into one single Progenesis experiment to perform a paired statistical analysis, comparing IC and CL areas in both neurons and BBB experiments. Only those proteins quantified and identified with at least 2 unique peptides and with an Anova p-value <0.05 and a fold-change >|2| were considered significant. Fold-change was calculated dividing the highest mean normalized protein abundance by the lowest mean normalized protein abundance. We added a minus sign (-) when the highest abundance was found in CL area to indicate that protein levels were lower in IC area.	2017-12-01	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra117.000419"",""PMID:29133510""]]"

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.

Identification of high grade CIN lesions by population-based screening programs and their subsequent treatment has led to a significant reduction of the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. Cytology-based testing of cervical smears is the most widely used cervical cancer screening method, but is not ideal, as the sensitivity for detection of CIN2 and higher (CIN2+) is only ~55%. Therefore, more sensitive and specific biomarkers for cervical cancer and its precancerous stages are needed.

Our goal is to develop new predictive tools of nephropathy starting from urine, which can be easily obtained using noninvasive procedures and it is directly related to kidney. In this study, urine from children with recent diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was subjected to proteomic analysis in comparison to age-matched controls. Targeted confirmation was performed on children with a longer history of diabetes using Western Blotting and applying a urinary lipidomic approach. To definitively understand whether the observed alterations could be related to diabetic nephropathy, urine from diabetic adults with or without albuminuria, which is an indication of nephropathy, was also examined.

However, the molecular interactions between ONE and complex proteomes and their dynamics in situ remain largely unknown. Here we de-scribe a quantitative chemoproteomic analysis of protein adduction by ONE in cells, in which the cellular target profile of ONE is mimicked by its alkynyl surrogate. The analysis reveals four types of ONE-derived modifications in cells, including ketoamide and Schiff-base adducts to lysine, Michael adducts to cysteine, and a novel pyrrole adducts to cysteine. ONE-derived adducts co-localize and crosstalk with many histone marks and redox sensitive sites. All four types of modifications derived from ONE can be reversed site-specifically in cells. In summary, our study provides much-needed mechanistic insights into the cellular signaling and potential toxicities associated with this important lipid derived electrophile.

In this respect, biomechanical stimulation can trigger significant physiological cascades that can potentially modulate or interact with toxicity. Deoxynivalenol (DON, vomitoxin) is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins produced by Fusarium spp. and it was used to explore the delicate interaction between biomechanical stimulation and cytotoxic processes in A431 cells. In fact, in addition of being a well-known food contaminant, DON is becoming a relevant toxin also for other organ systems. The combination between biomechanical stimulation and the mycotoxin revealed how DON can impair crucial functions like cellular morphology and lysosome trafficking at concentrations far below those known to be cytotoxic in routine toxicity studies. Moreover, sub-toxic concentrations of DON (0.1-1 μM) impaired the capability of A431 cells to respond to a biomechanical stimulation that normally sustains trophic effects in this cell line. Ultimately, the effects of DON (0.1-10 μM) were partially modulated by the application of uniaxial stretching (0.5Hz, 24h, 15% deformation) suggesting a deep cross-talk between the cytotoxic potential of the mycotoxin and the biomechanical stimulation.

An insufficient understanding of mechanisms underlying tumor cell responses to chemotherapy contributes significantly to the lack of effective treatment regimens. Here, paclitaxel, a first-line chemotherapeutic agent, was observed to interact synergistically with birinapant, a Second Mitochondrial-derived Activator of Caspases mimetic. Therefore, we investigated molecular-level drug interaction mechanisms using comprehensive, reproducible, and well-controlled ion-current-based MS1 quantification (IonStar). In a set of 40 biological samples, we compared temporal proteomic responses of PDAC cells treated with birinapant and paclitaxel, alone and combined. Using stringent criteria (e.g. strict false-discovery-rate FDR control, 2 peptides/protein), we quantified 4069 unique proteins confidently (99.8% without any missing data), and 541 proteins were significantly altered in the three treatment groups with a FDR of <1%. Interestingly, most of these proteins were altered only by combined birinapant/paclitaxel, and these predominantly represented three biological processes: mitochondrial function, cell growth and apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. Proteins responsible for activation of oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid β-oxidation, and inactivation of aerobic glycolysis were altered largely by combined birinapant/paclitaxel compared to single drugs, suggesting that the Warburg effect, which is employed by PDAC cells for survival and proliferation, was alleviated by the combination treatment. Metabolic profiling confirmed substantially greater suppression of the Warburg effect by the combined agents compared to either drug alone. Western blot analysis confirmed changes in apoptosis/survival signaling pathways, such as inhibition of PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and MAPK/ERK signal transduction, as well as induction of G2/M arrest, and the drug combination induced much more apoptosis than did single agents. Overall, this in-depth, large-scale proteomics study provided novel insights into molecular mechanisms underlying synergy of combined birinapant/paclitaxel, and describes a proteomics/informatics pipeline that can be applied broadly to the development of cancer drug combination regimens.

A total of 4061 proteins was identified. The search parameters were set to 20 ppm tolerance for precursor ion mass and 0.02 Da for fragment ion mass. Two missed cleavages were permitted for fully tryptic peptides. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a static modification, and a dynamic modification was defined as oxidation at methionine and acetylation at the N-terminal. The FDR of identification was estimated using a target-decoy search strategy that was dependent on a concatenated database of forward and reversed sequences. At least two distinct peptides were required for each identified protein. The FDR for peptide and protein identification was set to 0.1% and 1% respectively. Quantitative analysis was operated with the locally-developed IonStar pipeline(29). It incorporates SIEVE (v2.2, Thermo Scientific) for chromatographic alignment using the ChromAlign algorithm(30), extraction and procurement of peptide peak areas, and a locally-developed R package (available at https://github.com/shxm725/IonStarstat) for data quality control, aggregation, normalization, removing outliers and summarization. The ion-current area under the curve (AUC) of same peptide was integrated into the same frame according to the following criteria: m/z width = 10 ppm; frame time width = 2.5 min. The merged feature intensity file was further processed using the IonStar data processing pipeline for proper data normalization (i.e. total ion-current normalization) and summarization (i.e. sum of intensities). Peptides shared by different proteins were excluded in order to quantify only the unique peptides of each protein. The relative expression ratios of proteins in two groups were calculated by comparing average ion current intensities of replicates in each group, and the statistical significance was evaluated with ANOVA. The cut-off for altered proteins and false-positive altered protein discovery rate were established using an Experimental Null method(27) (below).	2017-12-18	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra117.000519"",""PMID:29358341""]]"

First, cell lysates were pre-treated with DMSO vehicle, dasatinib, or erlotinib prior to addition of the ATP probe for ABPP to compare the differences in kinase labeling associated with examples of kinase inhibitors that vary in target selectivity.  Then, to examine changes in cellular signaling, H1993 cells were treated with vehicle controls, BEX-235 (PI3K inhibitor), or Crizotinib.  LC-MS/MS using data dependent acquisition, data-independent acquisition (pSMART), parallel reaction monitoring, and selected reaction monitoring (or multiple reaction monitoring) mass spectrometry were used to detect and relatively quantify the desthiobiotinylated kinase peptides.

Enzyme specificity was set to fully tryptic peptides with up to 3 missed cleavages (due to the lysine desthiobiotinylation); the fragmentation model was selected as ESI-QUAD.  Variable modifications included carbamidomethyl-cysteine, desthiobiotinyl-lysine, and oxidized methionine.  Peptide mass tolerance was set to +/-15 ppm; fragment ion tolerance was set to +/-0.05 Th. The spectral library used for DIA analysis was generated using DDA files from many lung cancer cell lines. DIA data files were analyzed using Pinnacle software (OPTYS). DDA LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out using Andromeda and MaxQuant for peptide identification and quantification searching data against human entries in UniProt (Version or date of download) with the following dynamic modifications: methionine oxidation, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and lysine desthiobiotinylation (+196.121178 Da).  Spiked PRTC peptides were assessed for internal QC metrics: retention time stability and ion signal consistency. Peptides lacking peaks in the control samples (DMSO) were removed from the dataset.  Statistical Analysis: Raw peak area values for DDA and DIA datasets were processed to remove minor variability using iterative rank order normalization (IRON), implemented in Galaxy. Statistical analysis and data visualization was performed using R programming in R Studio. The following R packages were used for data processing and visualization: ggplot243, dplyr44, reshape245, LSD46, VennDiagram47, and stringr.  In DIA and DDA datasets, all peptides with less than 3 values across the dataset (n = 18) or that were not seen in the control (DMSO) sample were removed. Peptides with a score less than 3 from the Pinncle software, meaning inadequate MS/MS data for identification or poor MS1 ion signal that was not sufficient for quantification, were removed from DIA datasets. Retention time correlations were also used to remove outliers from the datasets. Concordance across quantitative analysis methods was assessed between peak areas for each data point (protein, peptide, treatment) computing Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R).   Relative quantification (without stable-isotope labeled standards) was performed by log2 transforming the peak areas and the calculating fold changes of inhibitor treat-ment compared to DMSO vehicle controls. If a DMSO peak area was missing or deviated by more than 4x the average peak area across the control replicates, the DMSO peak area for a different technical replicate was used to calculate the fold change (5-15% of peptides, depending on the dataset). Standard error (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and boxplot statistics were calculated for each drug treatment MRM, PRM, and DIA datasets. Significance between SE boxplots was determined using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test for data that does not fit normal distribution.  Significance of log2-fold change values was determined using the student’s one-tailed t-test when identifying proteins or peptides that are down-regulated in response to treatment (p < 0.05). To identify peptides that were differentially regulated (up or down), a two-tailed t-test was used. Forest plots show 95% confidence intervals for all peptides observed across MRM, PRM, and DIA that had a fold change of less than -2 and a p-value ≤ 0.05 in at least one MS quantification platform.	2017-03-15	"[[""PMID:29164889"",""DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00329""]]"

Prompt and accurate diagnosis coupled with the timely administration of parenteral antibiotics is necessary in order to save lives. We used label-free mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics to identify specific protein signatures in cerebrospinal fluid from Malawian children with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children, elderly and people infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Samples were analysed in two independent cohorts (cases and controls, n=12 for the discovery cohort and n=16 for the verification cohort). The protein profiles clearly discriminated cases and controls. Proteins involved in the immune response and exosome cell signaling were significantly enriched in the infected samples. Several S. pneumoniae membrane proteins were identified suggesting these as potential therapeutic targets. For both cohorts, over 200 human proteins were up and down-regulated in children with confirmed S. pneumoniae infection in comparison with controls. Compiling proteins up- and down- regulated in both discovery and verification cohorts, we generated a comprehensive list of over 140 proteins from which diagnostic biomarkers could be nominated. For a panel of five selected proteins (cathelicidin, ceruloplasmin, myeloperoxidase, cystatin C and protein S100A8/S100 A9), we additionally verified the label-free results by automated quantitative western blot immunoassays (Simple Western™), with excellent agreement between the two experimental approaches. The proteins identified in our study could form the basis of development of a biomarker panel for rapid diagnosis. Our results could lead to the development of point-of-care assays to inform diagnosis, and to nominate new targets for drugs and vaccines to improve disease management and consequently to enhance the prognosis of children with bacterial meningitis.

However, methodologies to analyze proteomes in human tissue or body fluid samples at relevant scale and performance are still limited in clinical research. Their deployment and demonstration in large enough human populations are even sparser. In the present study, we have characterized and compared the plasma proteomes of two large independent cohorts of obese and overweight individuals using shotgun MS-based proteomics. One cohort comes from a Canadian single-center clinical weight management program while the other one belongs to a multicenter pan-European weight loss study (i.e., the DiOGenes study for which MS proteomic data have been already deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the dataset identifier PXD005216).

However, we currently lack a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for target recruitment and selectivity, which is critically required to enable rational design of degraders. Here we utilize comprehensive characterization of the ligand dependent CRBN/BRD4 interaction to demonstrate that binding between proteins that have not evolved to interact is plastic. Multiple X-ray crystal structures show that plasticity results in several distinct low energy binding conformations, which are selectively bound by ligands. We demonstrate that computational protein-protein docking can reveal the underlying inter-protein contacts and inform the design of the first BRD4 selective degrader that can discriminate between highly homologous BET bromodomains. Our findings that plastic inter-protein contacts confer selectivity for ligand-induced protein dimerization provide a conceptual framework for the development of heterobifunctional ligands.

The contribution of posttranscriptional gene regulatory networks to the DNA damage response (DDR) has not been extensively studied. Here, we systematically identified RNA-binding proteins differentially interacting with polyadenylated transcripts upon exposure of human breast carcinoma cells to ionizing irradiation (IR). Interestingly, more than 260 proteins showed increased binding to poly(A) RNA in IR-exposed cells and were comprised of many nucleolar proteins. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that DDX54 is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well defined class of pre-mRNAs which harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts. Since DDX54 promotes survival after exposure to IR its expression and/or mutation rate may impact DDR-related pathologies. Our work indicates the relevance of many uncharacterized RBPs potentially involved in the DDR.

It is known that endogenous HLA class I associated peptides may harbor posttranslational modifications. In particular, phosphorylated ligands have raised much interest as potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. By combining affinity purification with high resolution mass spectrometry, we identified more than 2000 unique ligands associated to HLA-B40. Sequence analysis revealed two major anchor motifs: Aspartic or glutamic acid at peptide position 2 (P2) and methionine, phenylalanine or aliphatic residues at the C-terminus. The use of IMAC and TiO2 affinity chromatography allowed the characterization of 86 phosphorylated ligands. Every sequence belonging to this subset was further confirmed by comparing its experimental MS2 spectrum with that obtained upon fragmentation of the corresponding synthetic peptide. Remarkably, three of the identified phospholigands lacked a canonical anchor residue at P2 containing phosphoserine instead. Binding assays showed that this sort of peptides bound to HLA-B40 with high affinity probably due to the molecular mimicry between these residues. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the peptide repertoire of a given HLA allotype can be broadened by the presentation of peptides with posttranslational modifications at major anchor positions. We suggest that ligands with phosphorylated residues at P2 may be optimal targets for T-cell based cancer immunotherapy.

In our previous study, we found that phosphoproteomics is one pleasant means to catch low-abundance and membrane proteins which are phosphorylated. Therefore, we speculate it may be an available approach for MPs detection. In this study, kidney cancer and adjacent tissues were used for phosphoproteomics research, we totally identified 8962 proteins including 6415 phosphoproteins, and 44728 phosphosites, of which 10266 were unreported previously. Interestingly, a total of 75 MPs were found, after rigorous screening and manual checking, 26 MPs were ranked as confident MPs by the verification with the synthesized peptides and a stringent manual check of their MS2 spectra, among which 14 MPs were phosphorylated. Functional analysis for 26 MPs revealed that 16 MPs were found to be membrane proteins, 7 MPs were testis-enriched and 1 MPs were kidney-specific. Therefore we concluded that phosphoproteomics is a promising approach in digging MPs for C-HPP studies.

The automatic gain control (AGC) was set as 1 × 106, and the maximum injection time (MIT) was 150 ms. The subsequent MS spectrum (MS2) was analyzed using data-dependent mode searching for the top 20 intense ions fragmented in the linear ion trap via collision induced dissociation (CID). Ions with charge state from 2+ to 4+ were subjected for screening. For each scan, the AGC was set at 1×104, and the NCE was set at 35, MIT was 25 ms. The dynamic exclusion was set at 35s to suppress repeated peak fragmentation. MS/MS raw files were processed in Proteome Discoverer 2.0(v2.1.21, Matrix Science Mascot) against the neXtProt database (release 2017.02). The parameters set for database searching were as follows: cysteine carbamidomethyl was specified as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine, N-acetylation and phospho (STY) were set as variable modifications. The tolerances of precursor and fragment ions were set at 20 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. For digestion, trypsin was set as protease with two missed cleavage permitted. Only the proteins satisfying the following criteria were considered: (1) the peptide length ≥7; (2) the FDR ≤ 1% at peptide level; (3) the FDR ≤ 1% at protein level; (4) at least two different peptides (both unique and shared peptides were considered) for protein identification. The peptides were quantified by the peak area in Proteome Discoverer. For protein quantification, only the top 3 unique peptides were used for area calculation.

413	PXD006901	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006901	Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma aggressiveness associated with differential expression of collagen and STAT1	Background: Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (vSCC) is a rare but debilitating disease. One vSCC subtype comprises tumor cells that grow and expand as a cohesive sheet of cells that “pushes” and compresses the associated lymphoplasmacytic (LPC) stroma. Another vSCC subtype features tumor cells that grow in loose association with other tumor cells and infiltrate the associated fibromyxoid (FMX) stroma consisting mainly of extracellular matrix. Clinically, infiltrative vSCC with FMX stroma (Inf/FMX) is significantly associated with lymph node metastases and recurrence. Methods: An unbiased proteomic approach was used to identify pathways that could produce these different vSCC subtypes. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from 10 cases of pushing vSCC with LPC stroma (Push/LPC) and 8 cases of Inf/FMX were subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: Analysis identified 2,265 different proteins in the 18 samples of vSCC. Of these, 344 proteins were differentially expressed (p<0.05) by at least 4-fold between vSCC subtypes. Of these, 59 were higher and 285 lower in Inf/FMX compared to Push/LPC tumors. Consistent with the desmoplastic morphology and increased picrosirius red staining, expression of subunits of several collagens (Col 1, 3, 6, 14, 18) was higher in the more aggressive Inf/FMX tumors. In contrast, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), an important regulator of several inflammatory pathways, was expressed at lower levels in the Inf/FMX tumors. This finding was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using an antibody to STAT1. An informatics analysis of the differing profiles identified differences in the integrin signaling pathway and inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway. This analysis also linked decreased expression of proteins involved antigen processing and presentation and increased expression of those with cell-matrix adhesion as processes with the more aggressive Inf/FMX vSCC subtype. Conclusions: Comparing the proteomic profiles of vSCC morphologic subtypes indicates that increased expression of collagen subunits and decreased expression of STAT1 are associated with a more aggressive tumor subtype. Informatic analyses further identify alterations in cell interaction with matrix and immune function differ with tumor aggressiveness. Identification of these pathways provides a molecular basis for understanding aggressiveness of vSCC.

Search parameters were as follows: trypsin digestion with up to three missed cleavages; fixed modification of carbamidomethyl of cysteine; variable modifications of oxidation on methionine and acetyl on N-terminus; first search set to 5 ppm precursor ion tolerance and the main search was set to 3 ppm; selected label-free quantitation with intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) with a minimum ratio of 1. A contaminants database was used for the first search to identify commonly identified contaminants. The 4 most abundant proteins (hemoglobin alpha and beta, keratin, and actin) were subtracted from the sum total intensity values because these proteins were in high abundance in all samples and commonly identified from tumor samples. Individual protein intensities were then corrected to account for differences in overall protein mass between samples using a normalization factor calculated from the sample with the lowest sum iBAQ intensity. Missing intensity values (i.e., for proteins not identified in a particular sample) were replaced with the lowest protein intensity detected in any sample as a minimal threshold value to facilitate further analysis. The data were then log2 transformed for statistical analysis using the Student’s t-test [11]. Fold change of proteins was calculated by subtracting the average log2 normalized iBAQ of Inf/FMX from the log2 normalized iBAQ of Push/LPC.	2017-07-07	"[[""PMID:29225558"",""DOI:10.1186/s12014-017-9175-8""]]"

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

The resulting files were used for final protein assembly providing the minimal list of proteins that could explain the available peptides identified. Initially, spectrum-to-peptide match stringency was set at 0.1% FDR with a minimum of 2 distinct peptides identified per protein. The dataset was limited to the 7526 protein groups identified while spectral counts were increased by relaxing the spectrum-to-peptide match FDR to 1%. Assembly at the gene level resulted in the identification of 7211 gene groups for the full dataset. Variant peptide sequences were identified by separate database searches using data from RNA-seq of the individual carcinomas using the R package customProDB.

427	PXD008029	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD008029	An adaptive pipeline to maximize isobaric tagging data in large-scale MS-based proteomics	Isobaric tagging is a method of choice in Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics for comparing multiple conditions at a time. Despite its multiplexing capabilities, when multiple experiments are merged for comparison in large sample-size studies, some drawbacks appears, due to the presence of missing values, which result from the stochastic nature of the Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode. Another indirect cause of data incompleteness might derive from the proteomic-typical data processing workflow that first identifies proteins in individual experiments and then only quantifies those identified proteins, leaving a large number of unmatched spectra with quantitative information unexploited.  Inspired by untargeted metabolomic and label-free proteomic workflows, we developed a quantification-driven bioinformatic pipeline (Quantify then Identify – QtI) that optimizes the processing of isobaric Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) data from large-scale studies. This pipeline includes innovative modules, such as the Peptide Match Rescue (PMR) and the Optimized Post-Translational Modification (OPTM) and outperforms a classical benchmark workflow in terms of quantification and identification rates, significantly reducing missing data while preserving unmatched features for quantitative comparison. The number of unexploited tandem mass spectra was reduced by 77% and 62% for two human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma datasets, respectively.

Protein identifications were obtained by searching databases of Rattus norvegicus databases (v15.12, 7,449 entries) and Homo Sapiens release 2011_11, 20335 entries). Sequence information of Alcohol dehydrogenase Saccharomyces cerevisiae was added to the databases to afford the ability to normalize the data sets and to estimate amounts and concentration [11] and that of known contaminant proteins (e.g. serum albumin Bos taurus and trypsin Sus scrofa). A decoy was generated on the fly with every database search experiment conducted to estimate the protein false positive rate of identification [43]. Data independent scanning protein identifications were accepted when more than three fragment ions per peptide, seven fragment ions per protein and more than 2 peptides per protein were identified, in at least one technical replicate per sample. Protein quantitation was only reported when the protein was detected in at least 2 out of 3 technical replicate of at least one biological replicate. Typical search criteria used for protein identification included automatic peptide and fragment ion tolerance settings (approximately 10 and 25 ppm, respectively), 1 allowed missed cleavage, fixed carbamidomethyl-cysteine modification and variable methionine oxidation. Raw data were expressed as ‘relative molar amount units’ calculated by dividing the determined molar amount for a given protein by the summed determined amount for all identified proteins as this accounts for both technical and biological variations (10;14;15).	2015-02-23	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.dib.2015.02.019"",""PMID:26217750""]]"

All of the lectins and lectin-like proteins were purified from yeast, and most showed binding to human glycans. To demonstrate the applicability of the human lectin microarray, human sperm were probed on the microarray and strong bindings were observed for several lectins, including galectin-1, 7, 8, GalNAc-T6, and ERGIC-53 (LMAN1). These bindings were validated by flow cytometry and fluorescence immunostaining. Further, mass spectrometry analysis showed that galectin-1 binds several membrane proteins including HSP90. Finally, functional assays showed that binding of galectin-8 could significantly enhance the acrosome reaction within human sperms. To our knowledge, this is the first construction of a human lectin microarray, and we anticipate it will find wide use for a range of human or mammalian studies, alone or in combination with plant lectin microarrays.

searched against the human uniprotKB (release date 2015.01.08) using Mascot (v. 2.4). Error tolerant searches were initially performed to identify modifications, followed by searches with set variable modifications based upon prominant IDs from the error tolerant searches. Search parameters included: Trypsin specificity, two missed cleavages, 15ppm precursor ion error, and 0.6Da fragment ion error. Variable modifications for post-error tolerant searches included: Carbamidomethylation(C), mono-, di-, and tri- oxidation(C), His->Asp, and Oxidation(H). Spectral matches with an expectation value >0.05 were excluded from analysis and semi-quantitation of specific modifications was performed. Using only spectral matches to fully tryptic peptides, no. of matches to oxidized vs. non-oxidized forms of the peptide were compared.	2015-08-26	"[[""DOI:10.1111/trf.13363"",""PMID:26426339""]]"

However, other than the underlying genotypes of these conditions, a limited knowledge exists of the exact pathomechanisms of these disorders. This study expands on our previous research investigating dystrophic stromal aggregates, with the aim of better elucidating the pathomechanism of 2 conditions arising from the most common TGFBI mutations: granular corneal dystrophy (GCD1; R555W), and lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD1; R124C). GCD1 and LCD1 patient corneas were stained with H&E and Congo red to visualise stromal non-amyloid and amyloid deposits, respectively. Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate aggregates and extracted protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Proteins were identified and their approximate abundances were determined. Spectra of TGFBIp peptides were also recorded and quantified. In total, 3 proteins were found within GCD1 aggregates that were absent in the healthy control corneal tissue. In comparison an additional 18 and 24 proteins within stromal LCD1 and Bowman’s LCD1 deposits, respectively, were identified. Variances surrounding the endogenous cleavage sites of TGFBIp were also noted. An increase in the number of residues experiencing cleavage was observed in both GCD1 aggregates and LCD1 deposits. The study reveals previously unknown differences 1 between the protein composition of GCD1 and LCD1 aggregates, and confirms the presence of the HtrA1 protease in LCD1-amyloid aggregates. In addition, we find mutation specific differences in the processingof mutant TGFBIp species, which may contribute to the variable phenotypes noted in TGFBI-related dystrophies.

As search parameters, semi-trypsin was specified as the enzyme allowing one mis10 cleavage. Carbamidomethyl was set as fixed modification and oxidation of methionine and proline as variable modifications. The tolerances of precursor and product ions were set to 10ppm and 0.2Da, respectively, and ESI-QUAD-TOF was selected as instrument used. All searches had a p-value <0.01 applied and an expected value of 0.005. Only protein hits identified by a minimum of two peptides with Mascot ion scores above 30 were considered for further analyses. All cytokeratins identified within the analysis were regarded as contaminants and removed from the proteome profiles, as carried out in previous studies.9 In addition, porcine tryptic peptides identical to human peptides were removed as porcine trypsin was used during the processing of the samples. The remaining proteins were arranged based on their exponentially modified Protein Abundance Index values (emPAI) reflecting their abundances within the aggregates. To compile a comprehensive list of proteins found in multiple GCD1 and LCD1 aggregates, relative abundances were calculated for proteins present in at least 2 tissues of the same biological significance. Relative abundance was termed as the average emPAI value for each protein across biological samples divided by the sum of the emPAI values of all proteins present within the tissue specimens. These values were then recorded as 1 a percentage for all proteins within each biological group,11 (Supplementary Table S1).  Determining spectral counts for tryptic and semi-tryptic TGFBIp peptides Spectral counts were carried out for every TGFBIp peptide with no missed cleavages, using methods previously described.7,8 Initially tryptic and semi-tryptic peptides were separated, with tryptic peptides being those identified as cleaved by trypsin during sample preparation on the C-terminal side of a Lys or Arg residue at both termini, while the list of semi-tryptic peptides included those cleaved on the C-terminal side of a Lys or Arg residue in just one terminus, and containing a non-tryptic cleavage site at the other peptide terminus. These non-tryptic cleavage site events are most likely due to the processing of TGFBIp by endogenous proteases present within the tissue samples collected. Spectral counts for all technical replicates were performed using the MS Data Miner v.1.3.0 software.12 Spectral count ratios were calculated by dividing the count of spectra for each TGFBIp peptide by the total number of spectra for tryptic or semi-tryptic TGFBIp peptides. Spectral count ratios were displayed as a percentage. The spectral count ratio for each peptide from each tissue was also presented graphically and grouped by disease. Significance of the variance between counts from disease tissue compared to those from control tissue was calculated using Fisher’s LSD test. In addition, the positions and frequencies of non-tryptic TGFBIp peptide cleavage sites were counted.  Statistics Three LC-MS/MS technical replicates 1 were run for each sample. Error bars indicate the standard deviation across samples of the same biological significance. For spectral counts Fisher’s LSD test was used to calculate significance between diseased tissue and control healthy tissue.	2015-05-27	"[[""PMID:26207300"",""DOI:10.1167/iovs.15-16922""]]"

To determine the role of inflammation and the specific contribution of activated fibroblasts in cancer development and progression we analyzed six human CRC tissue specimens and paired normal adjacent mucosa samples by LS/MS-MS. Amongst other, indeed several inflammation associated proteins were found differentially expressed compared to normal colonic mucosa. Two candidate molecules, SPARC and THBS2 were recently identified as proteins of a fibroblast inflammation signature. Analysis of public available RNA expression datasets revealed, that the mRNA of both SPARC and THBS2 are upregulated in CRC, typically in association with the CRC consensus molecular subtype 4 [CMS4]. Immunohistochemistry staining also demonstrated upregulation of SPARC and THBS2 in the tumor stroma compared to normal adjacent mucosa and indicated co-localization with the mesenchymal marker [alpha]SMA. In vitro 3D co-culture experiments with human colon derived fibroblasts and CRC cell lines resulted in enhanced SPARC and THBS2 protein levels when both cell types were cultivated in direct physical contact, compared to fibroblasts or cancer cells alone. This study demonstrates the feasibility of detecting tumor-specific signatures by LC-MS/MS and compatibility with RNA expression datasets. We identified an inflammation signature in CRC tissue and the data emphasized the contribution of activated fibroblasts in these events.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

By analogy with the nervous synapse, this cell-cell communication model requires the formation of highly organized structures that delimit an active zone of membrane traffic. For T cells to connect antigen recognition with the biological response, receptors and signaling proteins must be recycled. Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) is an endosomal protein best known for its role in recycling PDZ (PSD95, Dlg1, ZO-1)-interacting neuronal proteins via the retromer transport machinery. Alteration of this sorting pathway leads to neurodegeneration and is associated to Down syndrome, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. In T lymphocytes, SNX27 interacts with diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKz), which provides a mechanistic link between diacylglycerol metabolism and membrane trafficking. Following antigen recognition, SNX27-positive endosomes polarize to the IS and a PDZ-dependent SNX27 pool accumulates at the cell-cell contact area. To test for additional SNX27 functions, we carried out proteomic analysis of the SNX27 interactome purified from T cells in contact with APC, and identified SNX27 interaction with the retromer and with members of the WASH (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue) complex. This finding indicates the conserved nature of the SNX27/WASH/retromer complex in hematopoietic cells and suggests similarity between neurological diseases and abnormal immune/inflammatory responses. We also found PDZ-dependent SNX27 cargoes, including modulators of cytoskeletal reorganization such as zona occludens-2 (ZO-2).  ZO-2, a cytosolic component of epithelial cell-cell junctions, localized to the IS, and SNX27 silencing affected ZO-2 stability at the synapse. This study broadens our knowledge of SNX27 function in T lymphocytes, and suggests that pathways that delimit polarized structures in epithelial systems also participate in IS regulation.

MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.

Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are a promising tool for biomedical application, but they are immature and have not undergone metabolic shift related to early postnatal development. Cultivation of hiPSC-CM in 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) format leads to morphological maturation. This study compared the mitochondrial and metabolic state of hiPSC-CM in standard 2D culture and the EHT format and determined the influence of contractile activity. HiPSC-CM in EHTs showed ~2-fold higher number of mitochondria (electron microscopy), mitochondrial mass (mitotracker), DNA (Mt-ND1, Mt-ND2), and protein abundance (proteome) than in 2D culture. While hiPSC-CM exhibited the principal ability to use glucose, lactate and fatty acids as energy substrates irrespective of culture format, hiPSC-CM in 3D performed more oxidation of glucose, lactate and fatty acid, and less anaerobic glycolysis. The increase in mitochondrial mass and DNA in 3D was diminished by pharmacological inhibition of contractile force, suggesting that contractile work participates in mitochondrial development hiPSC-CM. In conclusion, contractile work in the EHT format contributes to metabolic maturation of hiPSC-CM.

These signaling events regulate cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, survival and apoptosis. Several studies have been successfully used to identify phosphorylated proteins and dynamic changes in phosphorylation status after stimulation. Nevertheless, it is still rather difficult to elucidate precise complex phosphorylation signaling pathways. In particular, how signal transduction pathways directly communicate from the outer cell surface through cytoplasmic space and then directly into chromatin networks to change the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape remains poorly understood. Here we describe the optimization and comparison of methods based on thiophosphorylation affinity enrichment, which can be utilized to monitor phosphorylation signaling into chromatin by isolation of phosphoprotein containing nucleosomes, a method we term phosphorylation-specific chromatin affinity purification (PS-ChAP). We utilized this PS-ChAP approach in combination with quantitative proteomics to identify changes in the phosphorylation status of chromatin bound proteins on nucleosomes following perturbation of transcriptional processes. We also demonstrate that this method can be employed to map phosphoprotein signaling into chromatin containing nucleosomes through identifying the genes those phosphorylated proteins are found on via thiophosphate PS-ChAP-qPCR. Thus, our results showed that PS-ChAP offers a new strategy for studying cellular signaling and chromatin biology, allowing us to directly and comprehensively investigate phosphorylation signaling into chromatin to investigate if these pathways are involved in altering gene expression.

Search parameter settings and the database were the same as in PLGS. The protein abundances in individual runs were normalized using the run that is least different from all other runs. Normalization to all proteins was selected. Quantification was done by Hi-N, using 3 most abundant peptides per protein. Positive identification was based on 2 or more peptide matches per identification. Proteins with differential abundance among the 4 groups were considered with fold change ≥ 1.5 and Anova ≤ 0.05. P-values between groups were calculated using t-test (independent, 2-tailed, unequal variance) and subsequently false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing was applied.	2017-12-11	"[[""DOI:10.3390/proteomes6010001"",""PMID:29286311""]]"

In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of endocytosis-associated proteins in HCCs with various differentiation grades. Therefore, we analyzed 36 tissue specimens from HCC patients via label-free LC-MS/MS including 19 HCC tissue samples with different degrees of histological grades and 17 corresponding non-tumorous tissue controls.  Following label-free analysis the abundances of SCAMP3 and CLTC were immunohistochemically examined in tissue sections of 84 HCC patients. We demonstrate the novel association of several endocytosis-associated proteins, in particular SCAMP3 with HCC progression.

Tissue damage is considered to be mediated mostly by proteases, but other bacterial and host factors may also play a role. To determine the presence of potentially injurious proteins we employed semi-quantitative Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology to identify sputum cellular proteins with consistently altered expression in CF compared to healthy controls. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, Gene Ontology functions, protein abundance and correlation with lung function were used to infer their clinical significance. The CF proteome exhibited differential expression of proteins relating to Rho family small GTPase activity, immune cell movement and activation, generation of reactive oxygen species and dysregulation of cell death and proliferation. Compositional breakdown established neutrophil extracellular trap proteins as the consistently most abundant cellular proteins detected, while a further 13 biologically relevant proteins were found to correlate negatively with lung function. These findings expand the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying CF lung disease and identify sputum cell proteins which might be useful as markers of disease status, prognostic indicators, stratification determinants for treatment prescription or as therapeutic targets.

Elucidating the true physiological functions of granzymes has been challenging since the origin of the granzyme studied, the use of non-physiological granzyme concentrations and the interspecies use of granzymes, with extrapolation of all these data to orthologous granzymes has led to inconsistencies. This is highly relevant for granzymes A and K where a debate is ongoing concerning their involvement in either cytotoxic or inflammatory processes, or in both. In order to tackle such contradictions, detailed knowledge of the substrate repertoires and substrate specificities of granzymes as well as their cleavage efficiencies may add in unraveling the primary signaling pathways these granzymes are involved in. Therefore, a degradome analysis using N-terminal COFRADIC was performed to unravel the substrate repertoires and subsite determinants for the closely related homologous human tryptases. We furthermore also profiled the uncharacterized mouse granzyme K in a comparative analysis with its human ortholog. Despite the subtle differences observed in the primary specificity profiles of these granzymes, for each granzyme distinguishing substrate subsite features could be elucidated.

While these peak lists were generated, grouping of spectra was allowed with a maximum intermediate retention time of 30 s, and a maximum intermediate scan count of 5 was used where possible. Grouping was done with 0.005 Da precursor tolerance. A peak list was only generated when the MS/MS spectrum contained more than 10 peaks. There was no deisotoping and the relative signal-to-noise limit was set at 2. These peak lists were then searched with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) using the Mascot Daemon interface (version 2.3, Matrix Science). Spectra were searched against the human Swiss-Prot database (version 2012_10 of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein database containing 20 233 human sequence entries). Variable modifications were set to pyro-glutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine and acetylation or trideutero-acetylation of the N-terminus. Fixed modifications were set as trideutero-acetylation of lysine, carbamidomethylated cysteine, and methionine oxidation (to its sulfoxide derivative). Mass tolerance on precursor ion was set to 10 ppm (with Mascot’s C13 option set to 1) and on fragment ion to 0.5 Da. The protease setting semi-ArgC/P (i.e., arginine-proline cleavage was allowed) was used, allowing for one missed cleavage. Only peptides that were ranked first and scored above the threshold score, set at 99% confidence, were withheld. The false discovery rate values obtained by searching a reverse decoy database were found to lie between 0.8% and 0.95%.(25) All quantifications [SILAC (12C6 l-arginine versus 13C6 l-arginine, 12C6 l-arginine versus 13C615N4 l-arginine and 13C6 l-arginine versus 13C615N4 l-arginine)] were carried out using the Mascot Distiller Quantitation Toolbox (version 2.3.2). The quantification method details were as follows: constrain search: yes; protein ratio type: average; report detail: yes; minimum peptides: 1; protocol: precursor; allow mass time match: yes; allow elution shift: no; all charge states: yes; fixed modifications: mass values. The software tries to fit an ideal isotopic distribution on the experimental data based on the peptide average amino acid composition. This is followed by extraction of the XIC signal of all peptide components (light, medium and heavy) from the raw data, and ratios are calculated by comparing the XIC peak areas of all matched light versus medium, light versus heavy, and medium versus heavy peptides (integration method “trapezium”, integration source “survey”). To calculate this ratio value, a least-squares fit to the component intensities from the different scans in the XIC peak was created. MS scans used for this ratio calculation are situated in the elution peak of the precursor determined by the Distiller software (XIC threshold 0.3, XIC smooth 1, Max XIC width 250). To validate the calculated ratio, the standard error on the least-square fit has to be below 0.16, and correlation coefficient of the isotopic envelope should be above 0.97. The calculated ratios that were originally reported as FALSE were all verified by visual inspection of all highest scoring MS spectra. All protein N-termini were corrected according to the deviation of a 1:1:1 ratio of protein-N-termini in both analyses (observed overall protein N-termini ratios in the hGrA/hGrK analysis and hGrK/mGrK analysis were 1:0.87:0.86 and 1:0.84:0.88 respectively).

While the typical methods for the determination of biologically relevant but low-abundant molecular species still relies on the use of specific antibodies, mass spectrometry-based methods are now gaining sufficient sensitivity to cope with such challenges. In the current study we have identified several cytokines and chemokines which were induced by inflammatory activation of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Based on the high-resolution mass spectrometry data obtained with a Q Exactive orbitrap, we built an MRM method to quantify the most relevant molecules selected from the screening experiment. Using nano-flow Chip-HPLC coupled to a 6490 triple-quadrupole MS for MRM analyses we achieved calibration curves covering a linear range of four orders of magnitude and detection limits in the low attomol per microliter concentration range. Carryover was consistently less than 0.005%, the accuracy between 80% and 120% and the median coefficient of variation for LC/MS was only 2.2%. When including the variance introduced by biological replicates and the digestion procedure, the coefficient of variation was less than 20% for most peptides. Selection of appropriate marker molecules allowed us to monitor typical cell culture variations such as different cell densities, proliferative states and the occurrence of cell death. As a result, here we present a robust and efficient MRM-based assay for the accurate and sensitive determination of cytokines and chemokines representative for functional cell states and including comprehensive quality controls.

To understand Treg identity, we compared by proteomics and transcriptomics human naïve (n) and effector (e)Tregs, Tconvs and transitional FOXP3+ cells. Only 12% of 422 differentially expressed proteins was identified as such at the mRNA level, demonstrating the importance of direct proteome measurement. Fifty-one proteins discriminated Tregs from Tconvs. This common Treg protein signature indicates altered signaling by TCR-, TNF receptor-, NFB-, PI3 kinase/mTOR-, NFAT- and STAT pathways, and unique cell biological and metabolic features. Another protein signature uniquely identified eTregs and revealed active cell division, apoptosis sensitivity and suppression of NFB- and STAT signaling. eTreg fate appears consolidated by FOXP3 outnumbering its partner transcription factors. These features explain why eTregs cannot produce inflammatory cytokines, whereas transitional FOXP3+ cells can. Collectively, our data reveal that Treg identity is defined and protected by uniquely “wired” signaling pathways.

GFI1 deletion causes hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, for which the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that GFI1 is required in T cells for the regulation of key DNA damage signalling and repair proteins. Specifically, GFI1 interacts with the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 and its substrates MRE11 and 53BP1. We demonstrate that GFI1 enables PRMT1 to bind and methylate MRE11 and 53BP1, which is necessary for their function in the DNA damage response. Thus, our results provide evidence that GFI1 can adopt non-transcriptional roles, mediating the post-translational modification of proteins involved in DNA repair. These findings have direct implications for treatment responses in tumours overexpressing GFI1 and suggest that GFI1's activity may be a therapeutic target in these malignancies."

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

In this latest tumor type, therapy relies on debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Despite the initial high response rates to platinum drugs, most patients relapse and die from the disease. Considering the high levels of thymidylate synthase, dhydrofolate reductase and other folate related proteins in platinum drug resistant patients, pemetrexed was proposed as a second line drugs due to its known mechanism of action that engage the mentioned proteins. However a successful outcome could only be expected on the basis of patients’ stratifications. In the present study, a discovery proteomics approach was applied to tissue samples collected beforepemetrexed treatment from platinum resistant patients who relapsed after the first-line carboplatin-based chemotherapy but responded differently to the pemetrexed treatment.

In addition, emerging evidence supports the role of IL-23-driven Th17 cells in inflammation. Components of the IL-23 signalling pathway, such as IL23R, JAK2 and STAT3, have been characterised, but elements unique to this network as compared to other interleukins have not been readily addressed. In this study, we have undertaken a multi-stage phosphoproteomics approach to better characterise downstream signalling events. To this end, we performed and compared phosphopeptide and phosphoprotein enrichment methodologies after activation of T lymphocytes by IL-23. We demonstrate the complementary nature of the two phosphor-enrichment approaches by maximising the capture of phosphorylation events. A total of 8069 unique phosphopeptides (containing 8344 unique sites), and 4317 unique phosphorylated proteins were identified, amongst which STAT3, PKM2, CDK6 and LASP-1 clearly showed induction of specific phosphorylation sites that were not readily observed after IL-2 stimulation. Interestingly, we observed subsequent translocation of STAT3 and PKM2 to the nucleus as well as increased phosphorylation especially of the nuclear portion at ~30 min after IL-23 stimulation, suggesting a wide range of cellular responses including proliferation and metabolic adaptation.

Cells within one experiment were taken from the same culture. Cells for experiments A and B were from the same batch and equal passage number, cells for experiment C were a separate batch with same passage number. All batches originated from cells frozen on the same date and stored in liquid nitrogen. Unstimulated/stimulated samples were digested as described above and the peptides labelled with two different dimethyl labels per the table below; note the inverted label strategy between dataset A and datasets B and C. Analysis of the MS data for these phosphopeptide datasets was performed using Proteome Discoverer v1.4 (PD, Thermo Scientific) and the default Dimethylation 2plex method. As search node we used Mascot (v2.3) and the Uniprot Swissprot database (human, retrieved 08/12/2013) with the following parameters: Missed cleavage = 1, Peptide Cut Off Score = 10, Precursor Mass Tolerance = 10 ppm, Fragment Mass Tolerance = 0.02 Da, Dynamic Modifications = Oxidation(M); Dimethyl/Dimethyl 2H(4) (K, N-term);Phospho (ST,Y), Static Modifications = Carbamidomethyl (C), Percolator Maximum Delta Cn =  0.05 & Target FDR = 0.05 ). Precursor quantitation settings were Mass Precision = 3 ppm, S/N Threshold = 1, RT Tolerance of Isotope Pattern Multiplets = 1 min, Single-Peak/Missing Channels Allowed = 1, Replace Missing Quan Values With Minimum Intensity = True. The results were initially filtered in PD according to the following parameters - quantify unique peptides only, Maximum Fold Change = 10000, Minimum Quantitation Value threshold = 0.1, Mascot cut-off value = 20, false discovery rate = 1 %, Peptide Grouping disabled, Protein Grouping enabled (using Strict Maximum Parsimony Principle). The list was refined to select only phosphopeptides, exported as .csv and further filtered in Excel to select Search Rank = 1, Unambiguous (allowing for protein grouping) peptides.  For each phosphopeptide, in cases of multiple data points due to multi-modal elution profiles or different charge states, the example with the highest mean abundance across both conditions was taken.  These final quantitation values for unique phosphopeptides are shown in the filtered data tabs of Table S1. Finally, stimulated/unstimulated ratios were normalised to correct for mixing error by dividing all values by the median of all peptides exported from PD (normalisation factor for datasets: A: 1.10, B: 1.14, C: 0.95).	2015-09-30	"[[""DOI:10.1038/srep24491"",""PMID:27080861""]]"

Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is a mitogen and motogen that has been implicated in the proliferation, migration and synthetic activities of smooth muscle cells (SMC) that characterize pathologic tissue remodeling in hollow organs.  To explore the signals induced by PDGF on a global scale, we performed expression profiling and quantitative proteomics analysis of PDGF-treated human visceral SMC. 1695 genes and 241 proteins were identified as differentially expressed in PDGF-treated primary bladder SMC versus non-treated cells. Analysis of gene expression data revealed MYC, JUN, EGR1, MYB and RUNX1 as the transcription factors most significantly networked with upregulated genes; DDIT3, NFAT5, and SOX5 were most networked with downregulated genes.        For protein identification and quantification, raw mass spectrometric data were analyzed with MaxQuant software (version 1.0.13.13). The parameters were set as follows. In the Quant module, SILAC triplets was selected; oxidation (M) and acetyl (Protein N-term) were set as variable modification; carbamidomethyl (C) was set as fixed modification; concatenated IPI human database (version 3.52) (74,190 forward sequences and 74,190 reverse sequences) was used for database searching; all other parameters were default. Tandem mass spectra were searched by Mascot (version 2.2.0.4) (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). In the Identify module, all parameters were default, except that maximal peptide posterior error probability was set as 0.05. False discovery rates for protein and peptide identifications were both set at 0.01.

First, cell lysates were pre-treated with DMSO vehicle, dasatinib, or erlotinib prior to addition of the ATP probe for ABPP to compare the differences in kinase labeling associated with examples of kinase inhibitors that vary in target selectivity.  Then, to examine changes in cellular signaling, H1993 cells were treated with vehicle controls, BEX-235 (PI3K inhibitor), or Crizotinib.  LC-MS/MS using data dependent acquisition, data-independent acquisition (pSMART), parallel reaction monitoring, and selected reaction monitoring (or multiple reaction monitoring) mass spectrometry were used to detect and relatively quantify the desthiobiotinylated kinase peptides.

Enzyme specificity was set to fully tryptic peptides with up to 3 missed cleavages (due to the lysine desthiobiotinylation); the fragmentation model was selected as ESI-QUAD.  Variable modifications included carbamidomethyl-cysteine, desthiobiotinyl-lysine, and oxidized methionine.  Peptide mass tolerance was set to +/-5 Da; fragment ion tolerance was set to +/-0.05 Th. The spectral library used for DIA analysis was generated using DDA files from many lung cancer cell lines. DIA data files were analyzed using Pinnacle software (OPTYS). DDA LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out using Andromeda and MaxQuant for peptide identification and quantification searching data against human entries in UniProt (Version or date of download) with the following dynamic modifications: methionine oxidation, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and lysine desthiobiotinylation (+196.121178 Da).  Spiked PRTC peptides were assessed for internal QC metrics: retention time stability and ion signal consistency. Peptides lacking peaks in the control samples (DMSO) were removed from the dataset.  Statistical Analysis: Raw peak area values for DDA and DIA datasets were processed to remove minor variability using iterative rank order normalization (IRON), implemented in Galaxy. Statistical analysis and data visualization was performed using R programming in R Studio. The following R packages were used for data processing and visualization: ggplot243, dplyr44, reshape245, LSD46, VennDiagram47, and stringr.  In DIA and DDA datasets, all peptides with less than 3 values across the dataset (n = 18) or that were not seen in the control (DMSO) sample were removed. Peptides with a score less than 3 from the Pinncle software, meaning inadequate MS/MS data for identification or poor MS1 ion signal that was not sufficient for quantification, were removed from DIA datasets. Retention time correlations were also used to remove outliers from the datasets. Concordance across quantitative analysis methods was assessed between peak areas for each data point (protein, peptide, treatment) computing Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R).   Relative quantification (without stable-isotope labeled standards) was performed by log2 transforming the peak areas and the calculating fold changes of inhibitor treat-ment compared to DMSO vehicle controls. If a DMSO peak area was missing or deviated by more than 4x the average peak area across the control replicates, the DMSO peak area for a different technical replicate was used to calculate the fold change (5-15% of peptides, depending on the dataset). Standard error (SE), 95% confidence intervals, and boxplot statistics were calculated for each drug treatment MRM, PRM, and DIA datasets. Significance between SE boxplots was determined using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test for data that does not fit normal distribution.  Significance of log2-fold change values was determined using the student’s one-tailed t-test when identifying proteins or peptides that are down-regulated in response to treatment (p < 0.05). To identify peptides that were differentially regulated (up or down), a two-tailed t-test was used. Forest plots show 95% confidence intervals for all peptides observed across MRM, PRM, and DIA that had a fold change of less than -2 and a p-value ≤ 0.05 in at least one MS quantification platform.	2017-03-15	"[[""PMID:29164889"",""DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00329""]]"

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method.

Here, we performed a comprehensive proteome profiling of platelets collected from 18 healthy subjects before and after administration of sarpogrelate. For each subject, platelets were isolated before and then again after drug administration to investigate the alteration in the platelet proteome by sarpogrelate. A sample preparation method involving filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) was used to improve extraction of proteins including both soluble and membraneous proteins. Moreover, an ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) coupled with extensive fractionation was used to generate a comprehensive proteome of platelets.

Early detection of BC is challenging in young women, due to the limitations of mammography on the dense breast tissue of young women. We recently reported results of a pilot study, using one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-PAGE)-based mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate differences in milk proteins from women with and without BC. Here, we applied two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE)-based MS to compare the protein pattern in milk from the breasts of a single woman who was diagnosed with BC in one breast 24 months after donating her mil. Statistically different gel spots were picked for protein digestion followed by nanoLC-MS/MS analysis. The upregulated proteins in BC versus control are alpha-amylase, gelsolin isoform a precursor, alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 zinc isoform CRA_b partial, apoptosis-inducing factor 2 and vitronectin. Several proteins were downregulated in the milk of the breast later diagnosed with cancer as compared to the milk from the healthy breast, including different isoforms of albumin, cholesterol esterase, different isoforms of lactoferrin, different proteins from the casein family and different isoforms of lysozyme. Results warrant further studies to determine the usefulness of these milk proteins for assessing risk and detecting occult disease.

The linearity of the scanner was checked with a calibrated neutral density filter set (Melles Griot, Irvine, CA) before scanning the gels. Progenesis Same Spots software (version 4.5, 2011, TotalLab, UK) and Progenesis PG240 software (version 2006, TotalLab, UK) were used for analysis of the gel images. Briefly, the images were wrapped, and the protein spots were found, then the background was subtracted followed by matching and quantification (measuring the spot percentage). Accurate manual checking was performed all the time. Spot percentage was defined as the spot integrated density above background. The dysregulation was measured as the fold change of the spot percentages. Fold change for upregulation (spot % of BC divided by spot % of control) is shown with positive numbers and downregulation (spot % of Control sample divided by spot % of BC sample) is shown with negative numbers. The differentially regulated protein spots from the Coomassie blue stained gels were picked and digested performing in-gel trypsin digestion: the gel spots were cut into very small pieces, then washed and de-stained followed by overnight in-gel trypsin digestion. After digestion, the peptide extraction was done, and the peptide mixture was cleaned using Zip-Tip reversed phase chromatography (C18 Ziptip™; Millipore, Billerica, MA). After ziptip was done and the sample were dried, the peptide mixtures were re-solubilized and analyzed by nanoliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) using a nanoACQUITY® UPLC coupled with a QTOF Ultima API mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) as described elsewhere. Using ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS version 2.4, Waters) software, the raw data files from the mass spectrometer were converted to pkl (peak list) files as described elsewhere. The processing parameters used for this conversion were as follows: Background polynomial of order 5 with background subtraction threshold of 35%, with smoothing iterations of 2, smoothing window of 3 channels and smoothing type of Savitzky-Golay. Centroid top was considered as top 80% of peaks and minimum peak width was considered as 4 channels. The pkl files were undergone data base search using web based MASCOT search engine (www.matrixscience.com). The database search parameters used in this study were as follow: National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), NCBInr 20150425 (65519838 sequences; 23472502492 residues) database, selected for Homo sapiens (human) (304503 sequences), cysteine propionamide as fixed modification, methionine oxidation as variable modifications, peptide mass tolerance of ±1.3 Da (one 13C isotope), fragment mass tolerance of ±0.8 Da, maximum missed cleavages=4. Apart from the proteins, which were identified directly from mascot database search, there were some spots that did not show any protein identification in mascot, but peptides from the corresponding protein to that spot were identified. For those peptides we performed de novo sequencing on MS/MS raw data files to identify more dysregulated proteins in our experiment.	2018-05-22	"[[""PMID:29756217"",""DOI:10.1002/elps.201800025""]]"

This stem-cell like character is important for cell therapies aiming at regeneration of specific immunity. Cell surface proteins are crucial for recognition and response to signals mediated by other cells or environmental changes. Knowledge of cell surface proteins of human naive CD4+ T cells and their changes during the early phase of T cell activation is urgently needed for a guided differentiation of naive T cells and may support the selection of  pluripotent cells for cell therapy.<br>Periodate oxidation and aniline-catalyzed oxime ligation (PAL) technology was applied with subsequent quantitative LC-MS/MS (PAL-qLC-MS/MS) to generate a dataset describing the surface proteome of human naive CD4+ T cells and to monitor dynamic changes during the early phase of activation. This led to the identification of 173 N-glycosylated surface proteins, of which 24 were previously not known to be expressed on human naive CD4+ T cells or have no defined role within T cell activation. To independently confirm the proteomic dataset and to analyse the cell surface by an alternative technique a systematic phenotypic expression analysis of surface antigens via flow cytometry was performed. This screening expanded the previous dataset, resulting in 229 surface proteins which are expressed on naive unstimulated and activated CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, we generated a surface expression atlas based on transcriptome data, experimental annotation and predicted subcellular localization, and correlated the proteomics result with this transcriptional dataset.<br>This extensive surface atlas provides an overall naive CD4+ T cell surface resource and will enable future studies aiming at a deeper understanding of mechanisms of T cell biology allowing the identification of novel immune targets usable for the development of therapeutic treatments.

From the MS prescan, the 10 most abundant peptide ions were selected for fragmentation in the linear ion trap if they exceeded an intensity of at least 200 counts and were at least doubly charged. During fragment analyses, high-resolution (60,000 full-width half maximum) MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap with a mass range from 300 to 1500 Da.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

For LF, the false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.2 for proteins. For TMT, the FDR threshold for peptides was 0.05 and 0.1 for proteins. Concordance of LF technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed intensities (Figure S2). For TMT, we found that MaxQuant automatically combined the technical replicates, so we examined the correlation of the MS data between experimental replicates (Figure S3). Peptide and protein group intensities were extracted from MaxQuant output and input into R/RStudio[33, 34] with corresponding metadata. Peptides and protein groups were both filtered to remove data with posterior error probability > 0.05, reverse-only sequences, non-human peptides, and peptides that were identified but had no corresponding intensities. Intensity values for peptides and protein groups that passed filtering were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein group intensities.  Pinnacle Data Analysis Label free files were searched against human entries in UniProt (as above) using both Sequest and Mascot in Protein Discoverer (v. 1.4 with Percolator). Two missed tryptic cleavages were allowed, precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, MS/MS mass tolerance was 0.05 Da, and dynamic modifications included carbamidomethylation and oxidation. The search result files were loaded into Pinnacle version 1.0.26.0, and the spectral library threshold settings included a Percolator q-value less than 0.05, XCorr scores above 1.5/2.0/2.2 for singly/doubly/triply charged peptides, and a Mascot Ion score > 29. Pinnacle was then used for the peptide and protein identification from the DIA results.[27] Concordance of technical replicates was measured using Pearson’s correlation of log2-transformed peptide peak areas (Figure S4). Five ranked scores are assigned by Pinnacle. Pinnacle peptides that were not contained in the filtered spectral library created from the LF dataset were removed as along with their corresponding proteins. Pinnacle proteins with less than a quality score of 3 were also removed (full Pinnacle scoring can be found in Table S2). Peak areas were then log2-transformed for subsequent analyses. Missing values were replaced with NA so that they were excluded from plots and calculations in the R environment. The differential expression threshold was defined as 1.5 times the SD of the average log2 ratio of tumor and normal protein peak areas. SCC Marker Identification  In a previous publication, we analyzed two publically available SCC datasets and compared the findings with our own experiment.[9] We took the list of SCC markers from these three datasets and examined their expression levels in these LF, TMT, and DIA datasets. We defined a marker as having at least 1.5 times higher expression in SCC compared to lung adenocarcinoma and a p-value of less than 0.05 from a Welch two-sample t-test (Table S3).  In order to complete the PRIDE submission, Mascot searches for DIA data were conducted using 5 Da peptide mass tolerance and 0.05 Da fragment ion tolerance.	2016-07-29	"[[""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201600300"",""PMID:28195392""]]"

These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.

489	PXD009021	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009021	Proteomic Analysis of Human Liver Reference Material	Recent advances in mass spectrometric (MS) instruments resulting in high mass resolution and high duty cycles have allowed of very deep coverage of proteomes. However, even with state of the art, high duty cycle instruments, the number of proteins identified with a conventional single liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC/MS/MS) analysis is typically limited and fractionating protein samples prior to LC/MS/MS analysis is crucial for increasing both the analytical dynamic range and proteome coverage.  In order to achieve near comprehensive identification of proteomes two-dimensional (2D) chromatography has been an invaluable tool.  This first dimension is typically performed with µL/min flow and relatively large column inner diameters, which allow efficient pre-fractionation but typically require peptide amounts in the milligram range while the second dimension is typically performed with nL/min flow rates and capillary columns with small inner diameters. Typically, reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) provides high peak resolution of peptides and achieves higher peak capacities than strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) due to the faster chromatographic partitioning. Another advantage of RPLC is that the mobile phases used generate much cleaner samples for downstream analyses, while the incorporation of a desalting step for SCX in order to eliminated the high salt concentrations that can significantly decrease the analytical sensitivity of the MS analysis due to ionization problems. When operated at widely different pH values (e.g., 1st dimension pH 10 and 2nd dimension pH 3) 2D RPLC-RPLC provides separation orthogonality comparable to that of the combination of SCX-RPLC. The difference of separation selectivity between the low and high pH (HpH) RPLC comes from the changes in the charge distribution within peptide chains upon altering pH of the eluent.  Herein we describe a method in which tryptic peptides are separated in the first dimension by HpH-RPLC and fractions are collected every 90 s over an 80 min gradient. For the second dimension, each of these fractions is individually run by the standard low pH RPLC method. The implementation of the HpH pre-fractionation allows for short second dimension gradients for bottom up LC/MS/MS and yields very deep (e.g. thousands of identifications) protein coverage at reasonable measurement time.

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

499	PXD010708	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010708	Characterization of cerebrospinal fluid via data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the brain and serves as a valuable specimen to examine diseases of the central nervous system through analyzing its components. These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.

503	PXD001541	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD001541	Quantifying histone PTMs by bottom-up MS	Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) contribute to chromatin function through their chemical properties which influence chromatin structure, and their ability to recruit chromatin interacting proteins. Nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) has emerged as the most suitable technology for global histone modification analysis due to the high sensitivity and the high mass accuracy that provide confident identification. However, the histone nanoLC-MS/MS data analysis is even more challenging due to the large number and variety of isobaric histone peptides, and the high dynamic range of histone peptide abundances. Here, we introduce EpiProfile, a software tool that discriminates isobaric histone peptides using the distinguishing fragment ions in their tandem mass spectra and extracts the chromatographic area under the curve using previous knowledge about peptide retention time. The accuracy of EpiProfile was evaluated by analysis of mixtures containing different ratios of synthetic histone peptides. In addition to label-free quantification of histone peptides, EpiProfile is flexible, and can quantify different types of isotopically labeled histone peptides. EpiProfile is much more convenient when compared to manual quantification, filling the need of an automatic and freely available tool to quantify labeled and non-labeled modified histone peptides. In summary, EpiProfile is a valuable nanoLC-MS/MS based quantification tool for histone modifications, which can also be adapted to analyze non-histone protein samples.

Figure 1d shows the workflow of EpiProfile. The input of EpiProfile is m/z values and charge states of peptides. After one peptide is inputted, elution profiles of the peptide expected isotopes are reconstructed from MS scans. The extracted elution profile of the mono-isotopic mass for each given peptide is then selected. Three data types are extracted: RT, AUC, and full width at half maximum (FWHM). The final output contains both Excel tables and PDF figures.  The main challenges in quantifying histone peptides are determining the RTs of peptides and discriminating isobaric peptides. We modified EpiProfile to solve these problems. To accurately quantify histone peptides, we set the following parameters: xtract 1.0.0.2 in pFind Studio (pfind.ict.ac.cn) to generate peak lists, precursor mass tolerance ±10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance ±0.4 Da for CID, trypsin only cleaving after arginine and up to 2 miscleavages, Propionyl[Peptide N-term]/+56.026 as the fixed modification, Propionyl[K]/+56.026, Acetyl[K]/+42.011, Methyl_Propionyl[K]/+70.042, Dimethyl[K]/+28.031, Trimethyl[K]/+42.047, and Phospho[ST]/+79.966 as variable modifications. The quantification of histone peptides in EpiProfile consists of four steps: (1) extracting RT and AUC for the unmodified peptides; (2) locating RT for the modified peptides; (3) extracting RT and AUC for the modified peptides; (4) producing layouts and combining results.	2014-11-26	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:25805797""]]"

The definite characterization of dietary cow’s milk proteins (CMP) that survive the maternal digestive tract to be absorbed into the bloodstream and secreted into breast milk remains missing. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of CMP-derived peptides in breast milk, using antibody-independent methods.  Using high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry in blinded assays, we identified 11 cow’s milk-derived peptides, including two β-lactoglobulin (2 out 6 samples) and one αs1-casein (1 out 6 samples) fragments, in breast milk from mothers receiving a cup of bovine milk daily. The β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) fragments, namely f42-54 and f42-57, were absent in milk from mothers who observed a strict dairy-free diet (6 samples). In contrast, neither intact nor hydrolyzed β-Lg was detected by Western blot or competitive ELISA tests.  CMP-derived peptides rather than intact CMP may sensitize or elicit allergic responses in the neonate through mother’s milk. Immunologically active peptides from the maternal diet could be involved in priming the newborn’s immune system to drive tolerogenic response in neonates and infants.

Distant metastases in this disease most commonly develop in the liver and are often untreatable.  Here, we show that citrullination of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by cancer cell derived peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is essential for the growth of liver metastases.  Citrullination of proteins, a post-translational conversion of arginine residues to citrulline, is well recognized in rheumatoid arthritis, but largely undocumented in cancer. PAD4, a key enzyme responsible for catalyzing citrullination, is produced by metastatic colorectal cancer cells and found at higher levels in human liver metastases than in normal liver. Functional significance for citrullination in metastatic growth was evident in murine models where inhibition of citrullination, either globally by pharmacologic inhibition of PADs or specifically in colorectal cancer cells by PAD4 knockdown substantially reduced liver metastatic burden. Additionally, citrullination of a key ECM component collagen type I led to greater adhesion and decreased migration of colorectal cancer cells along with increased expression of characteristic epithelial markers, suggesting a role for citrullination in promoting mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and liver metastasis. Overall, our study revealed the potential for PAD4-dependant citrullination to drive the progression of liver metastasis. These data indicate that inhibition of citrullination could be exploited to prevent the development of liver metastases in colorectal cancer.

Oxidation of methionine, deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, and other known collagen and proteoglycan modifications were used as variable modifications. Peptide false discovery rate was adjusted to 1%. For label-free quantification of differentially expressed proteins, normalized abundance of each protein was determined by measuring the peak area intensity utilizing the Progenesis QI software (Nonlinear Dynamics). Briefly, protein abundance was calculated from the sum of all unique peptide ion abundances for a specific protein on each run. Normalization of abundance was performed to allow comparisons across different sample runs by the software. Proteins identified by more than one peptide were retained. The normalized peptide intensities for each sample were used to calculate fold change ratios for proteins between sample groups.	2018-06-27

Imatinib mesylate has emerged as the leading compound to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), through its inhibition of Bcr- Abl tyrosine kinases, and other cancers. However, resistance to imatinib develops frequently, particularly in late-stage disease and has necessitated the development of new BCR-ABL inhibitors. The synthesis of a new series of phenylaminopyrimidines, structurally related to imatinib showed large interest since the introduction of the nilotibin. To identify the cellular pathways affected by new synthesized compounds, we applied mass spectrometry together with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for the comparative study of protein expression in K562 cells that were untreated or treated with imatinib and imatinib derivates. Further, the global proteome of the K562 cells treated with imatinib were quantitatively compared with the cells treated with the new compounds. This study enriched our knowledge about direct cellular targets of kinase selective drugs. Further the results offered important new knowledge for gaining insights into the structural effects of action of the new compounds.  Samples were analyzed on a longer column (30cm) and a longer gradient (180min). Raw data files were processed with Mascot distiller 2.3. The mgf files were searched with Mascot daemon 2.3. The quantification was also done by Mascot Distiller.  All data was stored in ms_lims. The manual validation of false peptide ratios was done with Rover (part of ms_lims).  Fixed modifications: none.

We introduce EpiProfile 2.0 to quantify histone post-translational modifications from mass spectrometry data, in which fragment ions are used to determine the retention time of peptides and discriminate isobaric peptides. EpiProfile can automatically recognize and efficiently process both data-dependent and data-independent acquisition runs (DDA and DIA), and high-resolution and low-resolution instrument runs. The proteomics tool was tested on human cells and validated by synthetic histone peptides. EpiProfile is the first automatic program to determine the retention time and discriminate isobaric peptides for histone modifications with DIA MS.

To determine the histone layouts for new organisms, DDA and DIA can be both used, while DDA is for identification and DIA is for validation. DDA data can be searched against the histone database, with lots of variable modifications, e.g. acetylation (ac), mono-, di-, tri-methylation (me1, me2, and me3), phosphorylation (ph), crotonylation (cr), ubiquitination (ub), etc. A lot of search engines can be used. Two of them are recommended for histone identification, i.e. pFind and Mascot. pFind 3.0 is especially easy for histone identification, because both the MS2 and MS1 can be manually checked. In the DDA mode, some low-abundance peptides do not have the MS2 spectra. Even if the chromatographic peaks can be seen, we still do not have the MS/MS spectra. In contrast, DIA mode is a kind of validation. In the DIA mode, both the fragment ions and the chromatographic peaks can be seen. The retention time relationship of PTMs on the same peptide sequence (layout) is important. For example, ac (42.01 Da) and me3 (42.04 Da) are close in mass, but they are different in retention time (ac is later than me3). Isobaric peptides have the same mass, and in some case they co-elute. In this case the unique fragment ions in the MS2 spectra can be used to discriminate them. EpiProfile is developed to generate the layouts of PTMs on the same peptide sequence, discriminate the isobaric peptides, and then quantify the area under curve for each histone peptide.	2017-01-06	"[[""PMID:29790754"",""DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00133""]]"

For the first time a proteomic approach was undertaken to analyse the protein profiles of SMZL tissue. Western blot, immunohistochemical analysis and functional data mining were also performed in order to validate results, classify proteins, and explore their potential relationships. We demonstrated that SMZL is characterized by modulation of proteins related to energetic metabolism and apoptosis pathways. We also reported specific proteins (such as biliverdin reductase A, manganese superoxide dismutase, beta-2 microglobulin, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member A, and SET nuclear oncogene) directly involved in NF-kBand BCR pathways, as well as in chromatin remodelling and cytoskeleton.

This study was initiated to develop peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)-originated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived CECs. We isolated PBMC and programmed the mononuclear cells to generate iPSCs. Subsequently, the PBMC-originated iPSCs were differentiated to CECs. The morphology of differentiating iPSCs was examined at regular intervals by phase contrast microscopy. In parallel, the expression of pluripotent, and CECs-associated markers was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The molecular architecture of the iPSCs-derived CECs and human corneal endothelium (CE) were examined by mass spectrometry-based proteome sequencing. The PBMC-originated iPSCs expressed pluripotent-specific markers at levels similar to expression in H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Phase contrast microscopy illustrated that iPSCs-derived CECs are tightly adherent, exhibiting a hexagonal-like shape, one of the cardinal characteristics of CECs. The CECs-associated markers were expressed at many orders of magnitude higher in iPSCs-derived CECs at days 13, 20, and 30 compared to their respective levels in iPSCs. Importantly, only residual expression levels of pluripotency markers were detected in iPSCs-derived CECs. Mass spectrometry-based proteome profiling identified 10,575 proteins in iPSCs-derived CECs. In parallel, we completed proteome profiling of the human CE identifying 6345 proteins. Of these, 5763 proteins were identified in the iPSCs-derived CECs suggesting a 90.82% overlap between the iPSCs-derived CECs and human CE proteomes. Importantly, cryopreservation of iPSCs-derived CECs did not affect the tight adherence of CECs, and their hexagonal-like shape while expressing high levels of CECs-associated markers. We have successfully developed a personalized approach to generate CECs that closely mimic the molecular architecture of the human CE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the development of PBMC-originated, iPSCs-derived CECs.

The affected males harbour a Ser37Pro mutation in the gene encoding hNaa10, the catalytic subunit of NatA, themajor human NAT. In order to understand the detrimental impact of hNaa10 Ser37Pro, we performed structural, molecular and cellular investigations. Structural models and molecular dynamics simulations of the human NatA and its Ser37Pro mutant suggest differences in regions involved in catalysis and at the interface between hNaa10 and the auxiliary subunit hNaa15. In agreement, biochemical data demonstrate a reduced catalytic capacity and an impaired NatA complex formation with hNaa10 Ser37Pro. Patient derived Naa10 mutant cells show reduced Nt-acetylation for a subset of NatA/NatE-type substrates compared to wild type Naa10 cells. Ogden syndrome fibroblasts further display abnormal cell proliferation and migration capacity, possibly linked to perturbed Retinoblastoma- and MYLK-pathways, respectively.      Differential N-terminal combined fractional diagonal chromatography (COFRADIC) was used to quantify the degree and define the patterns of in vivo protein Nt-acetylation and here used to investigate whether patient cells derived from an affected Ogden male (carrying the Naa10 S37P mutation) displayed altered levels of protein Nt-acetylation at the proteome-wide level.

Modifications included carboxyamidomethyl (cysteines, fixed) and oxidation (methionine, variable). Mass tolerance was set to 2.0 for precursor ions and 1.0 for fragment ions. The database searched was the Human IPI databases version 3.6. The number of entries in the database was 160,900 which included both the target (forward) and the decoy (reversed) human sequences. Spectral matches were filtered to contain less than 1% FDR at the peptide level based on the target-decoy method. Finally, only tryptic matches were reported and spectral matches were manually examined. When peptides matched to multiple proteins, the peptide was assigned so that only the most logical protein was included (Occam's razor). This same principle was used for isoforms when present in the database.        Regarding the PRIDE XML result files: there are some delta m/z values that exceeded the normal limits. That is because all the Cysteins (C) in our experiments are modified by iodoacetamide (MOD:01214). The mass difference is 57 (total mass is 160, pride converter recognized it as 160). In addition to that, some Cysteins are dynamically modified to S-carboxamidoethyl-L-cysteine (MOD: 00417). We used C# and the mass difference is 14 in comparing with iodoacetamide cystein (total 174, 71 in comparing with unmodified cystein, pride converter recognized it as 71). The search was set up to be able to find alkylated cysteine if the cysteines were treated with iodoacetamide or if they were not to find the presence of mono-acrylamide adducts on cysteine. These numbers are different to the default mass diff in PRIDE converter and thus caused the identifications with big delta m/z. I have checked the peptides with big delta m/z and they are all correct identifications and match with our final identification list in our manuscript. So I am sure we have used the correct PTM MODs for our experiments.	2014-07-29	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:25096995""]]"
526	PXD009801	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009801	The nature and extent of contributions by defective ribosome products to the HLA peptidome	MHC class I peptides are products of endogenous cellular protein degradation. Their prompt presentation, after rapid degradation of their newly synthesized source proteins, is needed to alert the immune system during pathogen infection. A possible source for such rapidly degrading proteins can be defective ribosome products (DRiPs), which include polypeptides produced as part of the pioneer round of translation, premature translation termination, and proteins failing to fold properly or to assemble into their multisubunit protein complexes. However, the identities and relative contribution to the MHC peptidome of these mature or newly synthesized and rapidly degraded cellular proteins is not well understood. To clarify these issues, we used dynamic stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture to define the relative rates of synthesis of the HLA class I peptidomes and the source proteomes of three cultured human hematopoietic cell lines. Large numbers of HLA class I peptides were observed to be derived from DRiPs, defined here as HLA peptides that shift from their light to heavy isotope forms, faster than their source proteins. Specific groups of proteins, such as ribosomal and T-complex protein 1 (TCP-1), contributed a disproportionately large number of DRiPs to the HLA peptidomes. Furthermore, no significant preference was observed for HLA peptides derived from the amino terminal regions of the proteins, suggesting that the contribution of products of premature translation termination was minimal. Thus, the most likely sources of DRiPs-derived HLA peptides are full-sized, misassembled, and surplus subunits of large protein complexes.

Amyloidosis is a disorder characterized by the formation of extracellular amyloid deposits.  Immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis the most common form of amyloidosis can appear as a local disorder presented with mild symptoms or as a life threatening systemic disease. Identification of the proteins forming amyloid fibrils is essential for the diagnosis of the disease and knowledge about the overall protein composition of the deposits may lead to a larger understanding of the deposition events thereby facilitating a more detailed picture of the molecular pathology.  In this study, we investigated the protein composition of AL amyloid deposits isolated from human eyelid, conjunctival and orbital specimens. Deposits and internal control tissue (patient tissue without apparent deposits) were procured by laser capture microdissection. Proteins in the captured amyloid and control samples were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and subsequently quantified using the label-free mass spectrometry quantification method exponential modified Protein Abundance Index.   Immunoglobulin light chain kappa or lambda was revealed to be the most predominant protein in the amyloid deposits. In addition, the protein profiles identified apolipoprotein E and serum amyloid P component to be associated with the immunoglobulin light chain deposits across all three tissues analyzed.   The method used in this study provides high sensitivity and specificity of typing amyloidosis and may provide additional information on the pathology of amyloidosis.

For label-free relative quantification of the samples, the match between runs option of MaxQuant was enabled with a time window of 0.7 min, to allow cross-assignment of MS features detected in the different runs. To perform relative quantification between proteins identified, we used the “Intensity” metric from the MaxQuant “protein group.txt” output (sum of peptide intensity values for each protein). Quantitative data were first normalized and missing protein intensity values were replaced by a constant noise value that was determined independently for each sample as the lowest value of the total protein population. Enrichment ratios between AEBSF not treated and AEBSF treated samples were calculated from the mean protein intensities derived from three technical replicate experiments.

RNA-binding proteins play central roles in RNA regulation, including translation and turnover. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 is highly expressed in hESCs to maintain their undifferentiated state and prevent default neural fate. Notably, loss of CSDE1 accelerates neural differentiation and potentiates neurogenesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of CSDE1 impairs neural differentiation. We find that CSDE1 post-transcriptionally modulates core components of multiple regulatory nodes of hESC identity, neuroectoderm commitment and neurogenesis. Among these key pro-neural/neuronal factors, CSDE1 binds fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) and vimentin (VIM) mRNAs as well as transcripts involved in neuron projection development regulating their stability and translation. Thus, our results uncover CSDE1 as a central post-transcriptional regulator of hESC identity and neurogenesis.

Despite playing a critical role in maintaining lens homeostasis, the mechanism(s) and consequences of this phenomenon are not well understood. Utilising a proteomic-based approach, this study characterised 238 endogenous peptides derived from age-related crystallin breakdowns present in the cortical tissues of young, middle-age and old human lenses. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis showed that the concentration of a prominent crystallin breakdown product in the lens increased significantly with age, which, coupled with the age-related increase in variety of the LMW crystallin peptide in the lens cortex, suggests that a major crystallin breakdown event taking place in the human lens cortex shortly after middle-age. In-depth analysis on the crystallin peptide terminal amino acids indicate the presence of trypsin-like proteolysis in the lens cortical cells, providing useful information on the mechanism(s) that contribute to crystallin breakdown in the aging human lens. Taken together, this work enhances our understanding on the age-related crystallin breakdown process in the cortical tissues of the human lens.

Progressive failure of the tendon leading to structural abnormality and tearing is accompanied by numerous cellular and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) changes in the tendon tissue. This proteomics study aimed to compare torn and aged rotator cuff tissue to young and healthy tissue, and provide the first ECM inventory of human supraspinatus tendon generated using label-free quantitative LC-MS/MS. Employing two digestion protocols (trypsin and elastase), we analysed grain-sized tendon supraspinatus biopsies from older patients with torn tendons and from young controls. Our findings confirm measurable degradation of collagen fibrils and associated proteins in old and torn tendons, suggesting a significant loss of tissue organisation. A particularly marked reduction of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) raises the possibility of using changes in levels of this glycoprotein as a marker of abnormal tissue, as previously suggested in horse models. Surprisingly, and despite using an elastase digestion for validation, elastin was not detected, raising the possibility that it is not highly abundant in human supraspinatus tendon. Finally, we identified marked changes to the elastic fibre, fibrillin-rich niche and the pericellular matrix. Further investigation of these regions may yield other potential biomarkers and help to explain detrimental cellular processes associated with tendon ageing and tendinopathy.

Serum samples were trypsin-digested and fractionated by SCX chromatography prior to SRM and PRM measurements. PRM data obtained by high-resolution mass spectrometry correlated better with ELISA measurements than SRM data measured on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. While all three methods (SRM, PRM, ELISA) were able to quantify HSP90 alpha in serum at the ng/mL level, the use of PRM on a high-resolution mass spectrometer reduced variation. To rule out that the observed differences in SRM and PRM are due to different mass spectrometry systems, the SCX fractions were measured on the same high-resolution instrument (Orbitrap) in the ion trap mode (IT-PRM); such measurements showed that intense co-eluting signals were present in the SRM method, but these interfering peaks were eliminated in the high-resolution PRM mode. Thus, this report shows that it is possible to measure ng/mL levels of HSP90 alpha in a reproducible, selective and sensitive way using PRM. This opens up the possibility to quantify low levels of multiple proteins in complex samples based on a fractionation strategy on tryptic peptides followed by SRM and PRM.

552	PXD000682	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000682	Transcriptomic and Proteomic Response of HC-04 to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)	The routine study of human malaria liver-stage biology in vitro is hampered by low infection efficiency of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lines (<0.1%), poor understanding of steady-state HCC biology, and lack of appropriate tools for trace sample analysis. HC-04 is the only HCC that supports complete development of human malaria parasites. We hypothesized that HCCs are in various intermediate stages of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and HC-04s retain epithelial characteristics that permit infection. We developed an novel analytical approach to test this hypothesis viz. the HC-04 response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We used online two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) to quantify protein expression profiles in HC-04 pre-/post-HGF treatment and validated these results by RT-qPCR and microscopy. We successfully increased protein identification efficiency over offline-2D methods by 12-fold using less sample material, allowing robust protein quantification. We observed expected up-regulation and down-regulation of EMT protein markers in response to HGF, but also unexpected cellular responses. HC-04 is thus susceptible to HGF-mediated signaling but to a lesser degree than what we observed for HepG2, a widely used, but poor malaria HCC model.  Our analytical approach to understanding the basic biology of HC-04 helps us understand the factors that may influence its utility as a model for malaria liver-stage development. We observed that HC-04 treatment with HGF prior to the addition of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites did not facilitate cell invasion, arguing for unlinking the effect of HGF on malaria liver stage development from hepatocyte invasion. Finally, our 2D-LC-MS/MS approach and broadly applicable experimental strategy should prove useful in the analysis of various hepatocyte-pathogen interactions, tumor progression and early disease events.

Mascot version 2.4.1 was used to search the SwissProt human 2012 protein FASTA sequence database (20,234 sequences) for peptide sequence assignments using the following parameters: precursor ion mass tolerance of 50 ppm and a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.2 daltons. Peptides were searched using fully tryptic cleavage constraints and up to two internal cleavages sites were allowed for tryptic digestion. Fixed modifications consisted of carbamidomethylation of cysteine. Variable modifications considered were oxidation of methionine residues. The Mascot searched results were exported as .DAT format and then imported into Scaffold software (Version 4.0.4, Proteome Software) for curation, label0-free quantification analysis, and visualization. Scaffold’s normalized  spectral counting was employed to compare relative protein abundance between naïve HC-04 and HGF treated HC-04 cell samples in each experiment as the basis for normalization of the spectral counts for all other LC-MS/MS data in that experiment. Scaffold calculates the spectrum count quantitative value by normalizing spectral counts across an experiment. The process of calculating normalized spectral counts is as follows: First, Scaffold takes the sum of all the Total Spectrum Counts for each MS sample. The sums are then scaled to the same level. Scaffold then applies the scaling factor for each sample to each protein group to produce an output with a normalized quantitative value.	2014-01-14	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:24532842""]]"

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.

However, the correct identification of covalently linked (cross-linked) peptides analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry is still an open challenge. Here we present SIM-XL, a software tool that can analyze data generated through commonly used cross-linkers (e.g., BS3/DSS, etc.). Our software introduces a new paradigm for search-space reduction, which ultimately accounts for its increase in speed and sensitivity. Moreover, our search engine is the first to capitalize on reporter ions for selecting tandem mass spectra derived from cross-linked peptides. It also makes available a 2D interaction map and a spectrum-annotation tool unmatched by any of its kind. We show SIM-XL to be more sensitive and faster than a competing tool when analyzing a dataset obtained from the human HSP90.

563	PXD010152	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010152	A Novel Two-Stage Tandem Mass Spectrometry Approach and Scoring Scheme for the Identification of O-GlcNAc Modified Peptides	The modification of serine and threonine residues in proteins by a single N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) residue is an emerging post-translational modification (PTM) with broad biological implications. However, the systematic or large-scale analysis of this PTM is hampered by several factors, including low stoichiometry and the lability of the O-glycosidic bond during tandem mass spectrometry. Using a library of 72 synthetic glycopeptides, we developed a two-stage tandem MS approach consisting of pulsed Q dissociation (PQD) for O-GlcNAc peptide detection and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) for identification and site localization. Based on a set of O-GlcNAc specific fragment ions, we further developed a score (OScore) that discriminates O-GlcNAc peptide spectra from spectra of unmodified peptides with 95% sensitivity and >99% specificity. Integrating the OScore into the two-stage LC-MS/MS approach detected O-GlcNAc peptides in the low fmol range and at 10-fold better sensitivity than a single data-dependent ETD tandem MS experiment.

Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation.

To address the problem of phenotypic difference and heterogeneity, the Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) project was set up as a public-private partnership within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), engaging academia, the pharmaceutical industry and patient groups. The goal of this investigation was to identify proteomic fingerprints in induced sputum that characterize patients with severe asthma and to determine whether subgroups of severe asthmatics can be identified. Furthermore, we were interested in elucidating the biological pathways that showed differences between subgroups. This dataset is a description of the normal sputum proteome.

The optimal setting for peak detection across the dataset was determined using Threshold inspector (Waters) and these thresholds were applied: low energy = 100 counts; high energy = 30 (for serum this was set to 25) and a total energy count threshold of 750. Database searches were performed using regression tester and searched against the Uniprot human reference database (20/11/2014) with added sequence information for internal standards. A false positive rate of 4% was applied. Data was further filtered for protein quantitation by only considering proteins that were identified in at least two replicates. By using the replication of protein assignments across different injections, the false positive rate is minimized, since chemical noise is random in nature and does not tend to replicate across injections. Quantity was estimated in absolute amounts using the Hi 3 method32, 41.  The ion accounting output files40 were compiled and summary information generated from search log files using custom Python scripts.  Information contained in ion accounting files were collated into a single .csv document using a custom Python script.  Data filtering and normalisation Protein identifications collated from the ion accounting files were further quality filtered by allowing only identifications with the following criteria: identification in at least two separate samples (not including replicate injections), a process that required at least three high quality unmodified peptides using the Hi3 method, and 2 peptides with at least 4 fragment ions for each protein.  All other protein identities were removed.  Proteins were first ranked according to coverage across the samples, and then each protein entry was ranked according to the order in which they were run. QC information was added for each sample (batch information, protein concentration, ion counts). Inforsense software (ID Business Solutions, Guildford, UK) was applied to generated heat maps for the top 150 proteins using both ‘top 3 peptide intensity sum’ (a proxy for concentration) and peptide concentrations (expressed in fmol) on column calculated from internal standards. Sample-wise correlation plots were created using Inferno RDN (http://omics.pnl.gov/software/infernordn)42. Heat maps and correlation plots were inspected for poor samples or injections; those with very low or no ID’s and/or poor correlation were removed from the dataset. Samples were analysed in duplicate and the average intensity values used for analysis.  For the purpose of quality control, several analyses were performed. Replicate injections were inspected for consistency in quantitation. To achieve this, an average of the two injections ‘top 3 peptide intensity sum’ was used and a distance matrix calculated by taking the Euclidian distance between the two injections as a function of the average of the injections. These values were visualised in a heat map, enabling rapid inspection of duplicates with high variance, which likely indicated a technical issue between injections (e.g. sprayer dropout, or failure to inject the correct volume).  In order to uniformly remove suspect injections from the dataset, we created the following universal rule: for samples with >2-fold between-injection difference in average intensity of proteins, the following rule (Rule 1) was applied: “report injection one intensity values for proteins, unless protein was only quantified in injection two, then include this value for increasing coverage”.	2017-02-22	"[[""DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00018"",""PMID:29737851""]]"

576	PXD007596	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007596	MHC peptides presentation is limited by availability of empty HLA molecules rather than the supply of peptides ligands	Whether the presentation levels of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, called the human leukocytes antigens, HLA, in humans) is limited by the availability of peptide ligands for loading or by the supply of empty MHC molecules, is a yet unresolved issue. This study aims to tackle this dilemma using large-scale immunopeptidome analyses. First, cultured cells (MCF-7) were treated with interferons, which dramatically increased presentation levels of their HLA-B molecules, much more than HLA-A and HLA-C. The differential increase in the HLA-B molecules with their bound peptides, was driven by elevated HLA synthesis levels and not by supply of peptides, since all three HLA allotypes draw peptides from the same peptide pool, which should have been affected similarly by the interferons treatment. In addition, artificial competition for peptides was created by recombinant high levels expression of soluble HLA-A*02:01 molecules, in the same MCF-7 cells and on top of their endogenous membranal HLA-A*02:01. This high level expression of the soluble HLA did not affect the endogenous membranal HLA-A*02:01 peptidomes or its cell surface presentation levels. We therefore concluded that a surplus supply of peptides is available for loading and that presentation levels are more likely limited by the supply of HLA molecules.

Perturbation of this epigenetic program can lead to events such as mis-regulation of gene transcription and diseases such as cancer. To begin to understand the epigenetic program correlated to the development of melanoma, we performed a quantitative mass spectrometric analysis of histone posttranslational modifications mis-regulated in melanoma cell culture. Aggressive melanoma cells were found to have elevated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) as well as over-expressed methyltransferase EZH2 that adds the specific modification. The altered epigenetic program that led to elevated H3K27me3 in melanoma cell culture was found to directly silence transcription of the tumor suppressor gene RUNX3. The elevated level of H3K27me3 and silencing of RUNX3 transcription was also validated in advanced stage human melanoma tissues. The study presented underscores the utility of using high resolution mass spectrometry to identify mis-regulated epigenetic programs in diseases such as cancer, which could ultimately lead to the identification of biological markers for diagnostic and prognostic applications.

Mascot search parameters were specified as follows: trypsin digestion with up to two missed cleavages; fixed carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine; variable methyl, dimethyl, trimethyl, acetyl, acetyl:2H3 and methyl+acetyl:2H3 modification of lysine; variable phosphorylation of serine and threonine; 2.0 ppm precursor ion tolerance; 0.50 Da fragment ion tolerance.  A reverse-sequence decoy search was also performed.  Peptide and protein identifications were validated using Scaffold (v4.4; Proteome Software).  Peptide identifications were accepted at >50.0% probability as determined by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm.  Protein identifications were accepted at >95.0% probability and a minimum of two identified peptides.  Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm.  Proteins with similar peptides that could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.  Histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 peptide precursor intensity values were manually extracted from the raw files using Qual Browser (Thermo Xcalibur 2.2 SP1.48). The observed mass for each histone peptide was extracted from Scaffold and used to locate the appropriate MS spectra and export the precursor intensity value for each peptide. The intensity values for all histone peptides were log2 normalized, centered based on the median value,  scaled based on the standard deviation, and the median of each technical triplicate value was used to calculate the Student t-test for the biological replicate samples (SAS version 9.4). The transformed data met the assumption of normality and equality of variances according to the Kolomogorov-Smirnov (p-value = 0.489) and the Levene test (p-value =.1161), respectfully (Unscrambler X, version 10.3, CAMO software).	2015-10-19	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:26621846""]]"

The integrity of the mitral valve is also essential for the maintenance of normal LV size, geometry, and function. Significant advances in the comprehension of the biological, functional, and mechanical behavior of the mitral valve have recently been made. However, current knowledge of protein components in the normal human mitral valve is still limited and complicated by the low cellularity of this tissue and the presence of high abundant proteins from the extracellular matrix. We employed here an integrated proteomic approach to analyse the protein composition of the normal human mitral valve and reported confident identification of 422 proteins, some of which have not been previously described in this tissue. In particular, we described the ability of pre-MS separation technique based on liquid-phase IEF and SDS-PAGE to identify the largest number of proteins. These initial results provide a valuable basis for future studies aimed at analysing in depth the mitral valve protein composition and at investigating potential pathogenetic molecular mechanisms.

For LC-MS/MS analysis of in gel digestions the following criteria were used: methionine oxidation and phosphorylation (Thr, Tyr and Ser)  were considered as variable modifications, one missed cleavage per peptide was allowed, and the mass tolerance window was set to 20 ppm for peptide precursors and 0.05 Da for fragments. In parallel, the spectra were also searched against Uniprot database using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK). Valid identification required two or more peptides independently matching the same protein sequence, with a significant peptide score (higher than the identity score from Mascot). The following search criteria were used for protein identification from LC/MSE data: default search parameters included the “automatic” setting for mass accuracy (approximately 10 ppm for precursor ions and 25 ppm for product ions); a minimum of one peptide match per protein, a minimum of three consecutive product ion matches per peptide, and a minimum of seven total product ion matches per protein; up to one missed cleavage site allowed; carbamidomethyl-cysteine as fixed modification; and methionine oxidation as variable modification. Additionally, for LC/MSE, a randomized version of the databank was created in order to check the real false discovery rate, and only proteins identified in two replicates were considered as valid identifications.	2016-06-21	"[[""PMID:27450324"",""DOI:10.1002/elps.201600081""]]"

After stimulation of Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, syndromatic platelets show a reduced phosphatidylserine exposure and do not form membrane blebs. Given the central role of anoctamin-6 in the platelet procoagulant response, we used quantitative proteomics to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and the complex phenotypic changes in Scott platelets compared to control platelets. Therefore, we applied an iTRAQ-based multi-pronged strategy to quantify changes in (i) the global proteome, (ii) the phosphoproteome and (iii) proteolytic events between resting and stimulated Scott and control platelets.  Our data indicate a limited number of proteins with decreased (70) or increased (64) expression in Scott platelets, among those we observed the absence of anoctamin-6 and the strong up-regulation of aquaporin-1. Furthermore, the quantification of 1,566 phosphopeptides revealed major differences between Scott and control platelets after stimulation with thrombin/convulxin or ionomycin. Finally, we quantified 1,596 N-terminal peptides in activated Scott and control platelets, 180 of which we identified as calpain-regulated, whereas a distinct set of 23 neo-N-termini was caspase-regulated. In Scott platelets, calpain-induced cleavage of cytoskeleton-linked and signaling proteins was down-regulated, in accordance with an increased phosphorylation state. Thus, multi-pronged proteomic profiling of Scott platelets provides detailed insight into their protection against detrimental Ca2+-dependent changes that are normally associated with phosphatidylserine exposure.

Raw data were processed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 and 1.3 respectively (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Thus, data were searched against the Uniprot human database, Mascot and Sequest were used as search algorithms with the following settings: (i) trypsin as enzyme allowing two missed cleavages, (ii) iTRAQ 8-plex at N-termini and lysines and carbamidomethylation of Cys residues as fixed modifications, (iii) oxidation of methionine as variable modification, (iv) mass tolerances for MS and MS/MS were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. False discovery rate (FDR) estimation on the level of peptide spectrum matches was performed using the peptide validator node with filtering for 1% FDR (high confidence filter). The reporter ion quantifier node was used for iTRAQ reporter quantification. For the phosphoproteome analysis, phosphorylation of Ser/Thr/Tyr (+79.9663 Da) was set as variable modification furthermore, for localization of phosphorylated sites phospho-RS was used.For the global proteome only unique proteins quantified with at least 2 unique peptides were considered. Next, normalization factors were determinate and used to compensate for individual systematic errors (i.e. unequal sample amounts derived from pipetting errors or inaccurate BCA results) and to obtain normalized ratios. In addition, all data was scaled to obtain normalized abundance per iTRAQ channel. For the phosphoproteome, the obtained normalization factors from the global proteome were used to normalize the data and it was as well scaled to obtain normalized abundances. Furthermore, only phosphopeptides with phospho-RS probabilities >90% were considered as confident. Thus, for determination of confident phosphorylation sites at the peptide and protein level a ready-to-use Excel macro provided by Mechtler lab (http://ms.imp.ac.at/?goto=phosphors) was used. Additionally, label free quantification was performed using the Progenesis LC-MS software version 4.1 from Nonlinear Dynamics in combination with SearchGUI 2.8.1 and PeptideShaker 1.19.2.The following search parameters were used: (i) trypsin as protease with a maximum of two missed cleavages, (ii) carbamidomethylation of Cys as fixed, and (iii) oxidation of Met as variable modification. MS and MS/MS tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da. For all proteins, ratios between Scott and control platelets were calculated based on normalized areas obtained from Progenesis and log2-transformed. Regulations factors in both cases were as 2x SD of the normal distributed data. Finally, generated raw data from ChaFRADIC were searched against the human Uniprot database using Proteome Discoverer version 1.4 and Mascot 2.4 as search engine, reporter ion quantifier and percolator nodes. Enzyme specificities were set to semi-Arg-C, as Lys residues were blocked by iTRAQ labeling. To enable the quantification of two classes of N-terminal peptides, i.e. those with N-terminal iTRAQ label and those with endogenous N-acetylation, a two-step search strategy was performed. First, data were searched with iTRAQ-8plex (+304.2053 Da) as fixed modification at Lys and peptide N-termini; second, iTRAQ 8plex of Lys and N-terminal acetylation (+ 42.0105 Da) of N-termini were set as fixed modifications. In both cases, carbamidomethylation of Cys (+57.0214 Da) was selected as fixed and oxidation (+15.9949 Da) of methionine as variable modification. Mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm for MS and 0.02 Da for MS/MS. Identified peptides were filtered for high confidence corresponding to an FDR <1% at the PSM level, and a search engine rank of 1. The reporter ion quantifier node was adjusted according to the search settings. Quantification of N-terminal peptides across samples and conditions were essentially done as described for the phosphoproteome data. Sample set 2 was used to validate potential Calpain substrates. Therefore, the following ratios were determined: (i) ionomycin / unstimulated (ion effect); (ii) ionomycin+calpeptin / unstimulated (effect calpain inhibition); (iii) ionomycin+QVD-OPh / unstimulated (effect caspase inhibition)., (iv) ABT737 / unstimulated (ABT effect), (v)  ABT737+QVD-OPh / unstimulated (effect caspase inhibition), (vi) ABT737+calpeptin/ unstimulated (effect calpain inhibition). Sample set 1 was used to identify differential proteolytic cleavage between Scott and healthy platelets which we hypothesized to partially derive from Calpain activity. Therefore, for Set 1 only N-terminal peptides which were in agreement with the consensus motif (previously defined by an in vitro digestion of purified platelets platelets with recombinant calpain) showing a fold change between conditions were considered as regulated.	2016-04-12	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:27535140""]]"

We improved the precision and accuracy of peptide-ion intensity based quantification in order to enable accurate determination of protein turnover in non-dividing cells using dynamic-SILAC. This enabled precise and accurate protein half-life determination ranging from 10 to more than 1000 hours. We achieve good proteomic coverage ranging from four to six thousand proteins in several types of non-dividing cells, corresponding to a total of 9699 unique proteins over the entire dataset. Good agreement was observed in half-lives between B-cells, natural killer cells and monocytes, while hepatocytes and mouse embryonic neurons showed substantial differences.  Our comprehensive dataset enabled extension and statistical validation of the previous observation that subunits of protein complexes tend to have coherent turnover. Furthermore, we observed complex architecture dependent turnover within complexes of the proteasome and the nuclear pore complex. Our method is broadly applicable and might be used to investigate protein turnover in various cell types.

Despite its important role, chemical tools for profiling the composition and dynamics of ER proteins remain very limited because of the labile nature of these proteins. Here, we developed ER-localizable reactive molecules (called ERMs) as tools for ER-focused chemical proteomics. ERMs can spontaneously localize in the ER of living cells and selectively label ER-associated proteins with a combined affinity and imaging tag, enabling tag-mediated ER protein enrichment and identification with liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The ERM probes could be used simultaneously with the nucleus- and mitochondria-localizable reactive molecules previously developed by our group, which enabled orthogonal organellar chemoproteomics in a single biological sample. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes in ER-associated proteins in response to tunicamycin-induced ER stress was performed by combining ER-specific labeling with SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-based quantitative MS technology. Our results demonstrated that ERM-based chemical proteomics provides a powerful tool for labeling and profiling ER-related proteins in living cells.

Yet, this potential remains largely unexplored because thus far research has focused on either physicochemical design or on their application in micron-sized beads. For their use in life sciences, the biocompatibility of SPMNPs goes beyond their chemical composition and shape, and features like their size and more importantly their surface properties are becoming more important to exploit extra- and intracellular interactions. Here we introduce thermal decomposition to manufacture iron oxide based SPMNPs (Ø10nm) and demonstrate how different surface functionalizations can lead to different types of cellular interactions.  Cationic aminolipid-coated SPMNPs reside surprisingly strong at the outer cell surface. In contrast, anionic dimercaptosuccinic acid-coated SPMNPs are efficiently internalized and accumulate in a time-dependent manner in endosomal and lysosomal populations. These features allowed us to establish a standardized magnetic isolation procedure to selectively isolate plasma membranes and intracellular late endosomes/lysosomes with high yields and purities as consolidated by biochemical and ultrastructural analyses. Subsequent quantitative and qualitative proteome analysis underpins the overall high enrichment for hydrophobic (membrane) proteins as well as plasma membrane and lysosomal constituents in the respective purified fractions. This nano based technology provides therefore a breakthrough in the field of subcellular ‘omics’ as it allows the identification of subtle alterations in the biomolecular composition of different SPMNP-isolated compartments that would be otherwise not detected in total cell or tissue analysis.

While generating these peak lists, grouping of spectra was allowed in Mascot Distiller with a maximal intermediate retention time of 30 s, and a maximum intermediate scan count of 5 was used where possible. Grouping was done with 0.005 Da precursor tolerance. A peak list was only generated when the MS/MS spectrum contained more than 10 peaks. There was no de-isotoping and the relative signal to noise limit was set at 2. These peak lists were then searched using the Mascot search engine (MatrixScience, www.matrixscience.com) using the Mascot Daemon interface (version 2.4, Matrix Science). Spectra were searched against the SwissProt restricted to Homo sapiens taxonomy. Variable modifications were set to methionine oxidation, pyro-glutamate formation of amino terminal glutamine, and acetylation of the protein N-terminus. Mass tolerance on precursor ions was set to 10 ppm (with Mascot’s C13 option set to 1), and on fragment ions to 20 mmu. The instrument setting was put on ESI-QUAD.

The DNA methylation process generates S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, a strong inhibitor of DNMT1. Here we report that S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH/AHCY), the only mammalian enzyme capable of hydrolyzing S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine binds to DNMT1 during DNA replication. SAHH activates DNMT1 in vitro and its overexpression in mammalian cells leads to hypermethylation of the genome, whereas its inhibition by adenosine periodate resulted in hypomethylation of the genome. Hypermethylation was consistent in both gene bodies and repetitive DNA elements leading to both down- and up-regulation of genes. Similarly, hypomethylation led to both up- and down-regulation of genes suggesting methylated regions influence gene expression either positively or negatively. Cells overexpressing SAHH specifically up-regulated metabolic pathway genes and down-regulated PPAR and MAPK signaling pathways genes. Therefore, we suggest that alteration of SAHH level in the cell leads to aberrant DNA methylation, altered metabolite levels and gene expression.

(2011), we attempted to recover M. tuberculosis proteins in mummified lung tissues from which aDNA success had already been reported. Using a filter-aided sample preparation protocol modified for ancient samples we applied shotgun proteomics to seven samples of mummified lung, chest and pleura tissues. However, we only identified four peptides with unique matches to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, none of which were unique to M. tuberculosis, although we did identify a range of human proteins and non-mycobacterial bacterial proteins. In light of these limited results, we question the validity of the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) approach presented by Boros-Major et al. (2011), especially due to its similarity to that of human collagen, the dominant protein in the tissue under investigation. We explore the challenges of using proteomic approaches to detect M. tuberculosis, and propose that, given the contentious outcomes that have plagued ancient protein research in the past, the susceptibility of ancient material to modern contamination, and the degradation inherent in archaeological materials, caution is needed in the acquisition, analysis and reporting of proteomic data from such material.

Monitoring proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug. From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly regulated upon inflammatory activation. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced up-regulation of proteins such as IL-1beta, IL-6, CXCL2 and GROα was confirmed, however with strong quantitative inter-individual differences. Furthermore, the inability of dexamethasone to down-regulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes, suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method. While most consequences of dexamethasone were found compatible with the expected way of action, some unexpected but significant observations may relate with adverse effects.

601	PXD009754	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009754	LC-MSMS of the lc4 MHC class I immunopeptidome	MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.

607	PXD004415	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD004415	Quantitative phosphoproteome analysis of cisplatin-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells	Reversible protein phosphorylation is one of the most important posttranslational modifications (PTMs) due to its vital role in cellular functions and signaling pathways. Protein phosphorylation is also known to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Previously, we have performed a SILAC-based analysis of phosphotyrosinylation of cisplatin-induced apoptotic Jurkat T cells. To further expand this study, we used the same experimental setup and analyzed the global phosphorylation profile. The different steps of the phosphopeptide enrichment protocol using TiO2 beads were tested and the best approach was applied in combination with LC-MS with different normalized collision energy (NCE) values for HCD fragmentation. In total, more than 2,000 phosphoproteins of more than 4,000 phosphopeptides were identified in the four biological replicates of both states. HCD with NCE 25 accounted for 64% and NCE 35 for 36 % of identified phosphopeptides. 425 phosphopeptides were found to be significantly regulated in cisplatin-treated against control samples. KEGG pathway analysis revealed splicosomal proteins and the MAPK signaling pathway to be upregulated and cell cycle proteins to be downregulated. The transcription factors Atf2 and Jun, which are both involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, were further investigated. For Jun, more than 90 spectral counts were found only in apoptotic cells and covered the well-known stress induced phosphorylation sites at S-63/S-73, as well as S-243 which reduces the ability to bind DNA and is required for GSK3 mediated ubiquitinylation at S-239. For Atf2, more than 60 spectral counts were found in apoptotic cells vs. 8 in control cells. Most significantly upregulated sites for Atf2 have been identified at S-90 and S-112, which are less well studied phosphorylation sites of Atf2 as several other sites. Western blot analyses using non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated antibodies were performed to validate the phosphorylation events of Jun and Atf2. Our findings contribute to the current knowledge of the phosphorylation profiles of apoptotic cells.

For liquid chromatography separation, an Acclaim PepMap 100 column (C18, 3 µm beads, 100 Å, 75 μm inner diameter) (Dionex, Sunnyvale CA, USA) capillary of 50 cm bed length was used. A flow rate of 300 nL/min was employed with a solvent gradient of 4-35% B in 207 min, to 50% B in 20 min and then to 80% B in 2 min. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid/90% acetonitrile. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra (from m/z 300 to 2000) were acquired with the resolution R = 70,000 at m/z 200, after accumulation to a target of 1e6. The maximum allowed ion accumulation times were 100 ms. The method used allowed sequential isolation of up to the ten most intense ions, depending on signal intensity (intensity threshold 1.7e4), for fragmentation using higher-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) at a target value of 10,000 charges and a resolution R = 17,500 with NCE 25 and NCE 35. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 60 sec. The isolation window was m/z = 2 without offset. The maximum allowed ion accumulation for the MS/MS spectrum was 60 ms. For accurate mass measurements, the lock mass option was enabled in MS mode and the polydimethylcyclosiloxane ions generated in the electrospray process from ambient air were used for internal recalibration during the analysis.  All the raw files were converted to mgf files and searched against human Swiss-Prot database (Human Swiss-Prot, release 20160121, entries 20187) using Mascot (version 2.4.0, Matrix Science, London, UK) with the following parameters: parent tolerance, 10 ppm; fragment tolerance, 0.1 Da; enzyme, trypsin; max missed cleavage, 2; fixed modification, carbamidomethyl (C); variable modifications, N-terminal acetyl (Protein), oxidation (M), and phosphorylation (S, T, Y). The search results were imported to Scaffold (version, 4.4.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA) to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm with Scaffold delta-mass correction [39]. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm [40]. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Localization of phosphorylation sites were calculated and evaluated by Mascot maximum identity score and maximum Mascot delta score (MD-score) [33]. The entire MS2 total ion current (TIC) across all biological replicates were evaluated using t-test to determine regulated phosphorylated proteins.

Here we present a systematic proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-beta and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying an FDR of less than 0.01 at both peptide and protein level, a total of 8235 protein groups assembled from 163858 peptides was identified. Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine proteins regulated in each kind of cells during inflammation. Remarkably, cells were working on similar inflammation-related tasks, however, by regulating different proteins. Thus, we were able to determine cell type-specific inflammatory signatures, apparently resulting from cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Hallmarks of inflammation emerged from these findings, representing commonly and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.

Whether there are differences between the levels of these peptides between term and preterm milk remains unknown. Premature milk is produced before complete maturation of the mammary gland and is under the influence of a different hormonal milieu, which could change enzymatic activity and protein expression within the mammary gland and result in an altered peptide profile. We employed nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to identify naturally occurring peptides in term and premature milks at multiple time-points across lactation and compare the abundances of these peptides. We found that preterm milks produced more unique peptide sequences than term milks on average (359 vs. 286). The peptides identified were searched for overlapping sequences with an in-house database of known functional peptides. Specifically, we found that both term and preterm milks contain peptides overlapping with known sequences with antimicrobial, opioid antagonist and immunomodulatory actions. We also compared the enzymes involved in degradation of both milks via bioinformatic analysis. This analysis reveals that plasmin is more active in preterm milk than term milk.

Briefly, no complete modifications were required, but possible phosphorylations of serine, threonine or tyrosine, deamidation of glutamine or asparagine, and oxidation of methionine or tryptophan were allowed. Error tolerances employed were 20 ppm for precursor masses and 40 ppm for fragment masses.  The results from X!Tandem for all samples were compiled for all milk samples. Peptides with e-values ≤ 0.01 were removed (a 99% confidence level threshold). To isolate only unique peptide sequences, all duplicates of sequence, protein and modifications combined were eliminated with the “remove duplicates” function in Excel. Peptides representing identical amino acid sequences and modifications but modified in different positions were also removed as duplicates. Additional library peptides were derived from our previous analyses of milk peptides {Dallas, 2014 #5537}. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange (19) with identifier PXD000688. Peptide identification. Compounds were identified from MS-only runs of all samples by the “Find by Formula” function in Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis version 6 against the peptide library. The library information consisted of compound formula, neutral mass, retention time and a peptide ID. The target data type was small molecule (chromatographic). Only peaks with at least 1,000 ion counts were selected. The selected charge carrier was “protons”. The isotope model was “peptides” and the maximum assigned charge was 7. After compounds were extracted, they were matched to the peptide library by mass and retention time to identify peptides. The database match employed a mass error tolerance of 20 ppm and a retention time tolerance of 1 min. Each exact peptide mass in the library was converted to an m/z for all charge states from 1-7 for the search. The resulting peaks were integrated via the “agile” algorithm.	2014-06-23	"[[""DOI:10.3945/jn.114.203646"",""PMID:25540406""]]"

This reflects the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. In order to get more detailed insights into CLL development, we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis of primary human CLL cells and B cells from young and age-matched healthy individuals. For comparison, we also analyzed the chronic B cell leukemia cell line JVM-13 showing rather limited similarity to the primary cells. A principal component analysis comprising 6945 proteins separated these four groups, placing B cells of aged-matched controls between those of young donors and CLL patients. Remarkably, B cells from aged controls displayed significant regulation of proteins related to metabolic processes and stress response in mitochondria such as DLAT, FIS1 and NDUFAB1 as well as DNA repair including RAD9A, MGMT and XPA. Interestingly, these alterations apparently correlating with aging of B cells may also be essential for tumorigenesis and were observed similarly in CLL cells. In CLL cells, in addition, some remarkable unique features like the loss of tumor suppressor molecules PNN and JARID2, and high expression of CCDC88A, PIGR and ID3 otherwise associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and stemness were determined. Furthermore, while typical hallmarks of cancer such as cell proliferation were hardly apparent for CLL cells, alterations of metabolic enzymes were another outstanding feature in comparison to normal B cells, indicating increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids and increased consumption of glutamine. Targeted metabolomics assays corroborated these results. The present findings identify previously unrecognized features of CLL cells and suggest that aging may be accompanied by proteome alterations functionally relevant for predisposing B cells to transform to CLL cells.

We improved the precision and accuracy of peptide-ion intensity based quantification in order to enable accurate determination of protein turnover in non-dividing cells using dynamic-SILAC. This enabled precise and accurate protein half-life determination ranging from 10 to more than 1000 hours. We achieve good proteomic coverage ranging from four to six thousand proteins in several types of non-dividing cells, corresponding to a total of 9699 unique proteins over the entire dataset. Good agreement was observed in half-lives between B-cells, natural killer cells and monocytes, while hepatocytes and mouse embryonic neurons showed substantial differences.  Our comprehensive dataset enabled extension and statistical validation of the previous observation that subunits of protein complexes tend to have coherent turnover. Furthermore, we observed complex architecture dependent turnover within complexes of the proteasome and the nuclear pore complex.

619	PXD009755	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009755	LC-MSMS of the lc6 MHC class I immunopeptidome	MHC I-associated peptides (MAPs) presented at the surface of nucleated cells play a central role in CD8 T-cell immunosurveillance. MAPs presented by mature (i.e. MHC IIhi) medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEChi) are essential to eliminate self-reactive CD8 T cells in a process called central tolerance. On tumor cells, MAPs that do not induce tolerance (i.e. non-tolerogenic MAPs), because absent from mTEChi or any other normal cells, are referred to as tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). Despite their clinical relevance, very few have been identified, even in highly mutated tumor types. Thus, we developed a novel proteogenomic workflow able to characterize the full TSA landscape of any tumor. Briefly, using RNA-seq data, we subtracted the mTEChi from the tumor signal to generate tumor-specific protein databases enriched in non-tolerogenic sequences. Using these databases to analyze the MAP repertoire of two murine cell lines (CT26 and EL4) sequenced by mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 21 TSAs, 90% of which derived from allegedly non-coding regions. Interestingly, our results highlighted that 70% of those TSAs derived from non-mutated yet tumor-restricted sequences, e.g. endogenous retroelements. Moreover, we showed that our approach is easily amenable to analyze human primary samples as we were able to identify TSAs in three lung tumor biopsies and four B-ALL specimens. Focusing on 5 TSAs, we demonstrated that both TSA expression and TSA-specific T-cell frequency in the pre-immune repertoire influenced the overall survival of pre-immunized tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that non-coding-derived TSAs are frequent and protective in vivo, while they could be shared by several individuals. Altogether, our findings will help expand the repertoire of human TSAs and facilitate their prioritization in the clinic.

Applying their antipathogenic, antiproliferative and immune stimulatory capacities, recombinant IFNs are frequently prescribed as drugs to treat different diseases. IFNs act by changing the transcription of cells. Due to characteristics like rapid induction and signaling, IFNs represent prototypic model systems for various aspects of biomedical research. In respect to the signaling and activated promoters, IFNs can be subdivided in two groups. Here, alterations of the cellular proteome of human cells treated with IFN and IFN were elucidated in a time-dependent manner by mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteome analysis. The majority of protein regulations were strongly IFN type- and time-dependent. In addition to the expected upregulation of IFN-induced proteins, an astonishing number of proteins become profoundly repressed especially by IFN. Taken together, our comprehensive analysis deciphers the human interferome and its kinetics of protein induction and repression.

Among these strategies, bacteria induce transcriptional changes, in order to modify the set of proteins synthetized by the host cell, or target pre-existing proteins by modulating their post-translational modifications or by triggering their degradation. Protein levels variations in host cells during infection integrates both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations induced by pathogens. Here, we focused on host proteome alterations induced by the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and more specifically the Listeria toxin Listeriolysin O (LLO).  In order to characterize host proteome alterations induced by LLO, we performed a shotgun proteomics analysis on HeLa cells treated or not with the LLO toxin. To this end, in a first analysis we used SILAC labelling (stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture) to compare in a quantitative manner the protein content from two differentially treated cell populations: one control population and one population incubated with a sublytic dose of LLO (3 nM). We decided to expose cells to LLO during only 20 min to limit protein level changes resulting from transcriptional changes. We performed two independent experiments (experiment #1 and experiment #2) with swapped SILAC labelling to rule out putative labelling-dependent effects. A total of 2,009 and 2,577 proteins was quantified in each independent experiment, respectively, and 1,834 proteins were quantified in both experiments. Among these 1834 proteins, we identified a total of 151 proteins for which protein levels were consistently decreased in cells treated with LLO (i.e. with a log2 control/LLO ratio >0.5 in both experiments).  In addition to this preliminary study, we carried out a second experiment using label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics to compare protein abundance in cells treated or not with LLO. Four independent biological replicates were included in this second screen in order to perform a robust statistical analyses of downregulated proteins. Among the 2,973 proteins that were quantified in all independent replicates, we identified a total of 149 proteins (5.0 %) for which protein levels were significantly decreased in cells treated with LLO. In contrast to these decreases, only 16 proteins (0.5 %) showed significant increased levels in LLO-treated cells. This result confirmed that LLO remodels the cell proteome mainly by decreasing the level of host targets. To assess whether the host proteasome was involved in the decrease of these 149 proteins, we repeated our label-free proteomics analysis on HeLa cells pre-treated with proteasome inhibitors before exposure to LLO. Interestingly, we observed that the vast majority (i.e. 83%) of host proteins identified as strongly downregulated in response to LLO also displayed significant decreased levels in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that the majority of observed decreases in host protein levels induced by LLO are not due to proteasome-mediated degradation. In follow-up experiments, we validated that LLO decreases in particular the protein level of two E2 ubiquitin enzymes, UBE2K and UBE2N, leading to major changes in the host ubiquitylome. This toxin-induced proteome remodeling involves post-transcriptional regulations, as no modification in the transcription levels of the corresponding genes was observed. These decreases in host protein levels were observed in different epithelial cell lines but not in macrophages. In addition, we could show that Perfringolysin O, another bacterial pore-forming toxin similar to LLO, also induces host proteome changes. Taken together, our data show that different bacterial pore-forming toxins induce deep proteome remodeling, that may impair host epithelial cell functions.

Enzyme specificity was set as C-terminal to arginine and lysine, also allowing cleavage at proline bonds and a maximum of two missed cleavages. Acetylation of protein N-termini was set as a variable modification, while carbamidomethyl formation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification. In addition, oxidation of methionine residues was set as a variable modification in the label-free analyses and as a fixed modification in the SILAC analyses. To enable the identification of SILAC labeled peptides, the multiplicity was set to 2 with Lys4/Arg6 or Lys6/Arg6 settings in the heavy channel, allowing for a maximum of 3 labeled amino acids per peptide. In both SILAC and label-free analyses, only proteins with at least one unique or razor peptide were retained and a minimum ratio count of two unique or razor peptides was required for quantification. For the label-free analyses, matching between runs was enabled with a matching time window of 1 minute and an alignment time window of 20 minutes and proteins were quantified by the MaxLFQ algorithm integrated in the MaxQuant software. Further data analysis of the label-free samples was performed with the Perseus software (version 1.5.5.3) after loading the proteingroups file from MaxQuant.

Here we used mass-spectrometry (MS)- and antibody-based quantitative proteomic approaches to measure protein abundances for 75% of a hand-curated reconstructed ErbB network of 198 proteins, in two established cell types (HEK293 and MCF-7) and in primary keratinocyte cells. Comparison with other quantitative studies allowed building a set of ErbB network proteins expressed in all cells and another which are cell-specific and could impart specific properties to the network. As a proof-of-concept of the importance of protein concentration, we generated a small simplified mathematical model encompassing ligand binding, followed by receptor dimerization, activation, and degradation. The model predicts ErbB phosphorylation in HEK293, MCF-7, and keratinocyte cells simply by incorporating cell-type-specific ErbB1, ErbB2, and caveolin-1 abundances but otherwise contains similar rate constants. Altogether, the data provide a resource for protein abundances and localization to be included in larger mathematical models, enabling the generation of cell-type-specific computational models. Shotgun MS/MS analysis was conducted on HEK293 cells and on primary keratinocytes and SRM was used for all 3 cell types. Acquired data were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer software suite (v1.3.0.339, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the Mascot search engine (v2.3, Matrix Science) was used for peptide identification. Data were searched against an in-house generated database containing all proteins corresponding to human in the Swissprot human database (as of 3/2013) with 600 added common contaminants, as previously described, with a total number of 37 694 sequences in the database. A precursor ion mass tolerance of 7 ppm at the MS1 level was used, and up to three miscleavages for trypsin were allowed. The fragment ion mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da.

We used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze intact, undigested Aβ from purified soluble aggregates and insoluble material in brains of 6 cases with severe dementia and pathologically confirmed AD. The soluble aggregates are especially relevant because they are believed to be the most toxic form of Aβ. We found a diversity of Aβ peptides, with 26 unique proteoforms including various N- and C-terminal truncations. N- and C-terminal truncations comprised 73% and 30%, respectively, of the number of Aβ proteoforms detected. The Aβ proteoforms segregated between the soluble and more insoluble aggregates with N-terminal truncations predominating in the insoluble material and C- terminal truncations segregating into the soluble aggregates. In contrast, canonical Aβ comprised the minority of the number of identified proteoforms (15.3%) and did not distinguish between the soluble and more insoluble aggregates. The relative abundance of many truncated Aβ proteoforms did not correlate with post-mortem interval, suggesting they are not artefacts. This heterogeneity of Aβ proteoforms deepens our understanding of AD and offers many new avenues for investigation into pathological mechanisms of the disease, with implications for therapeutic development.

Precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance was 0.1 Da with no enzyme specificity. All modifications in the UniMod database (http://www.unimod.org) were considered in the PEAKS search. PEAKS automatically generates a decoy-fusion database, which appends a decoy sequence to each protein identification for the calculation of FDR6. The Spider search results with a score (-10logP) of 31.9 or higher (an estimated FDR value of 2.9% at the peptide level) for the CDR3 cohort data. Spider is an algorithm tool within PEAKS, which we utilized to search peptide spectrum matches not identified by the database search by altering the amino acids systematically at each residue until a new, better peptide sequence is constructed from the MS/MS data 7. All non-Aβ peptides and those Aβ proteoforms containing formylation were removed. Immunoprecipitation elution was in neat formic acid (Sigma #94318); thus, formylation occurring endogenously or by the elution conditions is indistinguishable. Further, samples were resuspended in MS buffer containing 5% methanol (v/v) to maintain solubility of Aβ, which in combination with 1% FA could lead to artefactual methylation via Fischer esterification.  In the CDR3 cohort, 27 Aβ proteoforms were identified meeting the criteria described above. However, we sought reproducible identification of the 27 Aβ proteoforms on an independent platform. The filtered list of Aβ proteoforms were i) assigned identification numbers by a third party who had no part in the initial analysis and ii) transformed into chemical formulas. This chemical formula list was queried against each .raw file with National Resource for Top-Down Proteomics (NRTDP) pipeline version 1.3 at ±10 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance and a 4 min retention time window alignment (Supp. Fig. 3). If a given proteoform was not identified by both platforms (PEAKS and NRTDP), it was removed from analysis; 26 out of 27 were reproducibly identified on both platforms. MS intensity was calculated across all peaks within an isotopic cluster extracted with Skyline for each proteoform identified in Fig. 2 and exported as an Excel file.	2017-05-19	"[[""DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-10422-x"",""PMID:28842697""]]"

Briefly, semiArgC/P was used as enzyme setting with one missed cleavage allowed. Methionine oxidation, trideuteron-acetylation of lysine and alkylation of cysteine were set as fixed modifications, while variable modifications included acetylation and trideutero-acetylation of N-termini and pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine residues. Mass tolerance of precursor and fragment ions was set to 10 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. To allow identification of peptides from both light and heavy labelled samples, a quantitation method with two different components was made, defining 12C6 Arg and 13C6 Arg as exclusive modifications at any position. Only peptides that were ranked first and scored above the threshold score set at 99% confidence were withheld. The FDR was calculated for every search as described previously and was always found to be lower than 0.78%. Potential false positive peptide identifications were selected and automatically removed by the Peptizer software application exactly as described before. Only peptides that fulfilled the following three conditions were considered as neo-N-terminal peptides reporting true cathepsin cleavage sites: (1) the start position of the peptide in the protein sequence is >2, (2) the N-terminal alpha amino group of the peptide is modified by trideutero-acetylation and (3) the light/heavy (L/H) ratio is > 2 (L/H ratios of neo-N-terminal peptides are distributed around 1, determination of the ratio cut-off value is based on the boundary of a one-sided 99% quantile of the ratio distribution) as described before [29]. Neo-N-terminal peptides were then loaded into the TOPPR database and re-mapped onto a later version of the Swiss-Prot database (release of January 22, 2014) to generate the final lists of total cleavage sites.	2014-11-25	"[[""PMID:25626674"",""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201400460""]]"

The present study establishes an in-depth CSF proteome through the analysis of a unique CSF sample from a pool of healthy donors. After immuno-affinity depletion, the CSF sample was fractionated using off-gel electrophoresis and analyzed with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MS) using the latest generation of hybrid Orbitrap mass spectrometers. The shotgun proteomic analysis allowed the identification of 20689 peptides mapping on 3379 proteins. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained dataset constitutes the largest CSF proteome published so far. Among the CSF proteins identified, 34% correspond to genes defined as elevated in the brain by The Human Protein Atlas. The principal Alzheimer disease biomarkers (e.g., tau protein, amyloid-β, apolipoprotein E and neurogranin) were detected. Importantly, our dataset significantly contributes to the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP), and 13 proteins considered as missing are proposed for validation in accordance with the HPP guidelines.

In this study we investigated whether it is possible to assess the functional state of cancer-associated fibroblasts through tumor tissue proteome profiling. Tissue proteomics was performed on tumor-central, tumor-near and tumor-distant biopsy sections from breast adenocarcinoma patients, which allowed us to identify 2074 proteins. Data were interpreted referring to reference proteome profiles generated from primary human mammary fibroblasts comprising 4095 proteins. These cells were analyzed in quiescent cell state, as well as after in vitro treatment with TGFβ or IL-1β, stimulating wound healing or inflammatory processes, respectively. Representative for cancer cells, we investigated the mammary carcinoma cell line ZR-75-1, identifying 5212 proteins. Comparison of tissue proteomics data with all those reference profiles revealed predominance of cancer cell-derived proteins within the tumor and fibroblast-derived proteins in the tumor-distant tissue sections. Remarkably, proteins characteristic for acute inflammation were hardly identified in the tissue samples. In contrast, several proteins found by us to be induced by TGFβ in mammary fibroblasts, including fibulin-5, SLC2A1 and MUC18, were positively identified in all tissue samples, with relatively higher abundance in tumor neighboring tissue sections. These findings indicate a predominance of cancer-associated fibroblasts with wound healing activities localized around tumors.

Efficient protein/glycoprotein extraction is a key step in the preparation of N-glycans derived from glycoproteins prior to LC-MS analysis. Convenient, efficient and unbiased sample preparation protocols are needed. Herein, we evaluated the use of sodium deoxycholate (SDC) acidic labile detergent to release N-glycans of glycoproteins derived from biological samples such as cancer cell lines. Compared to the filter aided sample preparation approach, the sodium deoxycholate (SDC) assisted approach was determined to be more efficient and unbiased. SDC removal was determined to be more efficient when using acidic precipitation rather than ethyl acetate phase transfer. Efficient extraction of proteins/glycoproteins from biological samples was achieved by combining SDC lysis buffer and beads beating cell disruption. This was suggested by a significant overall increase in the intensities of N-glycans released from cancer cell lines. Additionally, the use of SDC approach was also shown to be more reproducible than those methods that do not use SDC.

Here, we performed quantitative proteomic analyses of lysosomes rapidly isolated using the LysoIP method and find that nutrient levels and mTOR dynamically modulate the lysosomal proteome. We focus on NUFIP1, a protein that upon mTORC1 inhibition redistributes from the nucleus to autophagosomes and lysosomes. Upon these conditions, NUFIP1 interacts with ribosomes and delivers them to autophagosomes by directly binding to LC3B. The starvation-induced degradation of ribosomes via autophagy (ribophagy) depends on the capacity of NUFIP1 to bind LC3B and promotes cell survival. We conclude that NUFIP1 is a receptor for the selective autophagy of ribosomes.

The study of these cells has been hampered by the lack of reliable membrane markers: none of the antigens currently used for characterization and isolation of CFs is unique for this cell type. This issue has also raised doubts regarding a distinct identity of cardiac fibroblasts when comparing to other myocardium cell populations with similar morphologies. In this work, we report a comprehensive description and functional analysis of human CFs (hCFs) enriched membrane fraction proteome by advanced proteomic mass spectrometry-based tools. A total number of 1478 proteins were identified, including a 916 membrane proteins (62%). We also report on the identification of a set of 37 membrane proteins specific for hCFs by direct comparison with proteome lists of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) and human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs, hCSCs membrane proteome list is also available in this repository).

These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.

641	PXD010793	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010793	Estimating the Contribution of Proteasomal Spliced Peptides to the HLA-I Ligandome	Spliced peptides are short protein fragments spliced together in the proteasome by peptide bond formation. True estimation of the contribution of proteasome-spliced peptides (PSPs) to the global Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) ligandome is critical. A recent study suggested that PSPs contribute up to 30% of the HLA ligandome. We performed a thorough reanalysis of the reported results using multiple computational tools and various validation steps and concluded that only a fraction of the proposed PSPs passes the quality filters. To better estimate the actual number of PSPs, we present an alternative workflow. We performed de-novo sequencing of the HLA-peptide spectra and discarded all de-novo sequences found in the UniProt database. We checked whether the remaining de-novo sequences could match spliced peptides from human proteins. The spliced sequences were appended to the UniProt fasta file, which was searched by two search tools at a FDR of 1%. We find that 2-6% of the HLA ligandome could be explained as spliced protein fragments. The majority of these potential PSPs have good peptide-spectrum match properties and are predicted to bind the respective HLA molecules. However, it remains to be shown how many of these potential PSPs actually originate from proteasomal splicing events.

We employed the MaxQuant platform (17) version 1.5.5.1 and the Comet software release 2016.01  (18) to search the peak lists against a fasta file containing the UniProt database (Homo_sapiens_UP000005640_9606, 21,026 entries) and a  list of 247 frequently observed contaminants. For each sample, we added to the fasta file the list of DeNovo_spliced peptide sequence candidates. For Fib, we also added the 1,154 spliced peptides identified by Liepe et al. (3), which we named LM_spliced. The list of spliced peptides was kindly provided to us by the authors of (3) (Supplemental Data 6, type = “psp”). Peptides with a length between 8 and 25 AA were allowed. MaxQuant parameters: The second peptide identification option in Andromeda was enabled. The enzyme specificity was set as unspecific. A FDR of 1% was required for peptides and no protein FDR was set. The initial allowed mass deviation of the precursor ion was set to 6 ppm and the maximum fragment mass deviation was set to 20 ppm. For Fib, Methionine oxidation (15.994915 Da) were set as variable modification, however modified peptides were removed at first for the direct comparison to the Liepe’s data. For the additional modification searches in all samples, methionine oxidation N-terminal acetylation, as well as glutamine/asparagine deamidation (+0.98402 Da) were set as variable modifications. Comet parameters: activation method: HCD, peptide mass tolerance: 0.02 Da, fragment mass tolerance: 0.02, fragments: b- and y-ions, precursor tolerance, and modifications were the same as in MaxQuant settings. The output files summarizing MaxQuant and Comet result files are provided as Supplemental Data 7-16, and explanation of the column headers are provided in Supplemental Table 2.  Comparison of MS/MS annotations of endogenous HLA-Ip and their synthetic counterparts. To investigate if spliced peptides match the MS/MS spectra better than possible alternative sequences we first compared the MS/MS scans identified by Liepe et al. as spliced peptides and those identified by MaxQuant. The mapping to the relevant MS scans and their Mascot ion scores were kindly provided to us by the authors of (3) (Supplemental Data 6). For the Fib data, we selected three MS/MS scans of LM_spliced peptides identified both by MaxQuant and by Liepe et al., and 21 MS/MS scans corresponding to LM_spliced peptides that MaxQuant identified instead as UniProt peptides. This selection was not biased and was not based on prior knowledge, which would favor MaxQuant. We synthesized the 21 pairs of peptide sequences and the three LM_spliced peptide sequences and analyzed them by MS as mentioned above. For visual inspection we printed the endogenous and synthetic spectra to pdf files. For each of the 21 pairs, we calculated the similarity between the spectrum of the eluted peptide from Fib, annotated as LM_spliced and the spectrum of the synthetic LM_spliced peptide. We also calculated the similarity between the spectrum of the eluted peptide from Fib annotated as a UniProt peptide, and the spectrum of the synthetic Uniprot peptide. Similarly, we calculated the similarity between the three spectra of the identically identified spliced sequences and the spectra of their synthetic counterparts. The similarity was computed by the cosine score (value between 0 and 1, where a value of 0 corresponds to spectra with no peaks in common and a value of 1 to identical spectra) (19). The MzJava class library (20) was used to read the .mgf spectrum files and to calculate the similarity.	2018-08-16	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra118.000877"",""PMID:30171158""]]"

Trypsin is often the best protease in choice due to its high specificity and MS-favored proteolytic products. Trypsin has been challenged for its low cleavage efficiency at Lys-X bonds, and tandem Lys-C/trypsin digestion approach has been developed to alleviate the problem. However, the identification capacity of the two digestions often disagrees among different research groups. Herein, we report a new tandem digestion using Lys-C and Arg-C (Lys-C/Arg-C), which we have proven to be more efficient and specific than trypsin and Lys-C/trypsin approaches. Analysis of our previous data (Anal. Chem. 2018, 90, 1554-1559) revealed that both Lys-C and Arg-C perform better in trypsin-mode digestion. In particular for Arg-C, the identification capacity is increased to 2.6 times and even comparable with trypsin. The good complementarity, high digestion efficiency and high specificity of Lys-C and Arg-C prompt a tandem Lys-C/Arg-C digestion. We systematically evaluated the Lys-C/Arg-C digestion using qualitative and quantitative proteomics approaches and confirmed its superior performance in digestion efficiency, specificity and identification capacity to the currently widely used trypsin and Lys-C/trypsin digestions. As a result, we concluded that Lys-C/Arg-C digestion approach would be the choice of next-generation digestion approach for better results in both qualitative and quantitative proteomics studies.

In humans, AP-4 deficiency causes a severe neurological disorder of unknown aetiology. We apply unbiased proteomic methods, including ‘Dynamic Organellar Maps’, to find proteins whose subcellular localisation depends on AP-4. We identify three transmembrane cargo proteins, ATG9A, SERINC1 and SERINC3, and two AP-4 accessory proteins, RUSC1 and RUSC2. We demonstrate that AP-4 deficiency causes missorting of ATG9A in diverse cell types, including patient-derived cells, as well as dysregulation of autophagy. RUSC2 facilitates the transport of AP-4-derived, ATG9A-positive vesicles from the TGN to the cell periphery. These vesicles cluster in close association with autophagosomes, suggesting they are the “ATG9A reservoir” required for autophagosome biogenesis. Our study uncovers ATG9A trafficking as a ubiquitous function of the AP-4 pathway. Furthermore, it provides a potential molecular pathomechanism of AP-4 deficiency, through dysregulated spatial control of autophagy.

Mutant mouse models for the lysine demethylase KDM3A (JMJD1A, JMHD2A) share phenotypic features with human ciliopathies, including obesity and metabolic syndrome. Here we show that cilia of Kdm3a mutants are unstable with dysregulated length ranges accumulating intraflagellar transport proteins (IFTs) at the ciliary tip. RNA sequencing and mass-spectrometry identified actin cytoskeleton as the most miss-regulated feature during the ciliary cycle of KDM3A null cells and revealed that IFT81 contains Nε-methylated lysines in vivo to which recombinant KDM3A binds without subsequent demethylation. Mutations in these IFT81 methyl-lysine residues however stabilize KDM3A null cilia and potentiate ciliogenesis surpassing wild type cells; a synergism phenocopied by wild type cultures through the simultaneous destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton when over-expressing IFT81 lysine-mutants. Our work reveals that ciliogenesis requires the coordinated release of cytoskeletal constrains and the presence of intraflagellar transport proteins which KDM3A integrates aided by post-translationally modifiable lysine residues in IFT81.

It was created by fusing a 6-thioguanine-resistant mutant of the human rhabdomyosarcoma RD (cancer of skeletal muscle) with adult human oligodendrocytes by a lectin-enhanced polyethylene glycol procedure. In contrast to the tumor parent, MO3.13 expressed surface immunoreactivity for galactosyl cerebroside(GS) and intracellular immunoreactivity for myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). MO3.13 also exhibit the markers of immature oligodendrocytes GalC (galactosylceramidase) and CNPase. Upon differentiation, the MO3.13 cells have been also shown to express the MBP and MOG markers.

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The goal of this study was to determine markers of HF in African Americans, using plasma samples collected before the development of symptoms. We propose that early plasma glycoprotein changes will link to later development of heart failure.  ApolipoproteinF will be the strongest indicator. METHODS: Plasma samples from a subset of Jackson Heart Study participants with a history of MI but without prevalent heart failure (HF) at visit 2 (2005-2008) were analyzed by glycoproteomics. Individuals were grouped into those who experienced subsequent HF hospitalization after visit 2 (n=15; 3 men/ 12 women) and those without HF hospitalization through 2012 (n=45; 24 men/ 21 women). N-linked plasma glycopeptides were quantified by solid-phase extraction coupled to mass spectrometry and identified using RefSeq and SwissProt.

Missing data points were generated by imputation, whereby we distinguished two cases. For completely missing proteins lacking any valid data points, imputed data points were randomly generated in the bottom tail of the whole proteomics distribution, following the strategy in the Perseus software (http://www.biochem.mpg.de/5111810/perseus). For proteins having at least one valid MS data point, missing data points were generated using the local least squares (LLS) imputation method. Gene-based quantile normalization was applied to homogenize the abundance distributions of each protein with respect to statistical properties. To identify which proteins were affected by Sec61α and TRAPβ knock-down in siRNA-treated cells, we log2-transformed the ratio between siRNA and control samples, and performed two separate t-tests for each siRNA against the control sample. The P value was corrected using a permutation false discovery rate (FDR) test. Proteins with an FDR-adjusted P value (i.e., q value) of below 5% were considered significantly affected by knock-down of the targeted proteins. The results from the two t-tests were then intersected for further analysis.

Here we present the utilization of a high-performance multiplex proteomics approach based on depletion of highly abundant plasma proteins and enrichment of low abundance proteins and quantitation using a combination of label-free and isobaric labeling strategies for PDE samples from PD patients (n=20), who received either standard PD fluid or a novel PD fluid (added alanyl-glutamine (AlaGln)) in an open-label, randomized, two-period, cross-over clinical trial.

The resultant peak lists was searched against the human SwissProt database version v2013.01_20130110 (37398 sequences, including isoforms as obtained from varsplic.pl) with the search engines Mascot (v2.3.02, MatrixScience, London, U.K.) and Phenyx (v2.5.14, GeneBio, Geneva, Switzerland). Submission to the search engines was via a Perl script that performs an initial search with relatively broad mass tolerances (Mascot only) on both the precursor and fragment ions (±10 ppm and ±0.6 Da, respectively). High-conﬁdence peptide identiﬁcations were used to recalibrate all precursor and fragment ion masses prior to a second search with narrower mass tolerances (±4 ppm and ±0.025 Da). One missed tryptic cleavage site was allowed. Carbamidomethyl cysteine, N-terminal, and lysine-modiﬁed TMT 6plex were set as ﬁxed modiﬁcations, and oxidized methionine was set as a variable modiﬁcation. To validate the proteins, Mascot and Phenyx output ﬁles were processed by internally developed parsers. Proteins with ≥2 unique peptides above a score T1 or with a single peptide above a score T2 were selected as unambiguous identiﬁcations. Additional peptides for these validated proteins with score >T3 were also accepted. For Mascot and Phenyx, T1, T2, and T3 were equal to 16, 40, 10 and 5.5, 9.5, 3.5, respectively (p-value <10−3). Following the selection criteria, proteins were grouped on the basis of shared peptides, and only the group reporters are considered in the ﬁnal output of identiﬁed proteins. Spectral conﬂicts between Mascot and Phenyx peptide identiﬁcations were discarded. The whole procedure was repeated against a reversed database to assess the protein group false discovery rate (FDR). Peptide and protein group identiﬁcations were <0.1 and <1% FDR, respectively. Identified keratins (n=18) were only excluded from the results if containing the terms “hair” or “cuticular” as cytokeratins are markers of mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal wall.  TMT Semiquantitative Analysis The R software package Isobar (Breitwieser et al., J Prot Res 2011) was used to calculate protein ratios. Isobar is publically available under the LGPL license from the CeMM Web site (http://bioinformatics.cemm.oeaw. ac.at) and through Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/ packages/release/bioc/html/isobar.html). Isobar implements a signal intensity noise model to account for heteroscedasticity in TMT reporter ion ratios and calculates p values for each quantitated protein estimating technical and biological variability. The statistical framework of Isobar was described previously (Breitwieser et al., J Prot Res 2011). TMT reporter ions were extracted at the expected m/z ± 0.005 m/z, and intensities were corrected for isotopic impurities, as supplied by the manufacturer. All channels were normalized to equal sum of intensities. Protein identiﬁcations were grouped based on peptide matches from both samples. Protein ratios were calculated based on unique peptides. Proteins were denoted as signiﬁcantly regulated (in one sample) when the ratio p value was <0.05, and the protein also had a ratio >2.5 times the median absolute deviation from the median. For further analysis, proteins were selected that were signiﬁcant in one or both samples and showed the same direction of change with a ratio p value of <0.05 in both samples. A protein was also selected if there was a signiﬁcant change in one sample only.	2017-09-28	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra117.000186"",""PMID:29208752""]]"

Here we demonstrate that optimization of LC gradient and analytical column construction can reveal over 30,000 unique peptides and 23,000 phosphopeptides at high confidence. The quantitative reproducibility of different analytical workflows was evaluated by comparing the phosphoproteome of CD3/4 stimulated and unstimulated T-cells as a model system.  A fritless, 50 cm-long column packed with 1.9 µm particles operated with a standard pressure HPLC significantly improved the sequencing depth 51% and decreased the selected ion chromatogram peak spreading. Most importantly, under the optimal workflow we observed an improvement of 330% in detection of significantly changed phosphopeptides in the stimulated cells compared with the other workflows. The discovery power of the optimized column configuration was illustrated by identification of significantly altered phosphopeptides harboring novel sites from proteins previously established as important in T cell signaling including A-Raf, B-Raf, c-Myc, CARMA1, Fyn, ITK, LAT, NFAT1/2/3, PKCα, PLCγ1/2, RAF1, and SOS1. Taken together, our results revealed a simple column fabrication methodology that provides an inexpensive improvement for single-run LC-MS/MS analysis to optimize peptide sequencing depth, dynamic range, sensitivity, and label free quantitative reproducibility.

A concatenated database containing 144,156 “target” and “decoy reversed” sequences was employed to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). Peptide assignments from the database search were filtered down to 1% false discovery rate (FDR) by a logistic spectral score, as previously described. To validate the position of the phosphorylation sites, the Ascore algorithm was applied to all data, and the reported phosphorylation site position reflected the top Ascore prediction.  Relative quantification of phosphopeptide abundance was performed via calculation of selected ion chromatograms (SIC) peak areas. Retention time alignment of individual replicate analyses was performed as previously described. A minimum SIC peak area equivalent to the typical spectral noise level of 1000 was required of all data reported for label-free quantitation. Individual SIC peak areas were normalized to the peak area of the exogenously spiked phosphopeptide FQpSEEQQQTEDELQDK added prior to phosphopeptide enrichment and reversed-phase elution into the mass spectrometer. Quantitative analysis was applied to five biological replicate experiments.

For the cytosolic and the membrane enriched proteomic comparison, four replicates of fibroblast measurements obtained from PTEN patient were compared to six replicates from corresponding controls, separately.   Alignment of MS raw data was conducted by Progenesis Qi which automatically selected one of the LC-MS files as reference. After peak picking, only features within retention time and m/z windows from 0-115 min and 300-1500 m/z, with charge states +2, +3, and +4 were considered for peptide statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA). MS/MS spectra were exported in an mgf file as peak lists.   The mgf peak lists were searched against a concatenated target/decoy version of the human Uniprot database, (downloaded on 22nd of July 2015, containing 20,273 target sequences) using Mascot 2.4.0 (Matrix Science), X! TANDEM Vengeance (2015.12.15.2) and MS-GF+ Beta (v10282) (12/19/2014) with the help of searchGUI 3.1.4. Trypsin with a maximum of two missed cleavages was selected as enzyme. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed and oxidation of methionine was selected as variable modification. MS and MS/MS tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively.   We used our PeptideShaker software 1.13.3 (http://code.google.com/p/peptide-shaker/) for interpretation of peptide and protein identifications from searchGUI and Mascot. Combined search results were filtered at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1 % on the protein level and exported using the advanced PeptideShaker features that allow direct re-import of the quality-controlled data into Progenesis Qi. Peptide sequences containing oxidized methionines were excluded for further analysis. Only proteins that were quantified with unique peptides were exported. Then, for each protein, the average of the normalized abundances (obtained from Progenesis Qi) from the replicate analyses was calculated to determine the ratios between the PTEN patient and the controls. Only proteins which were (i) commonly quantified in all the replicates with (ii) unique peptides, (iii) an ANOVA p-value of <0.05 (Progenesis Qi) and (iv) an average log 2 ratio of which protein that was either higher than the up-regulated cut-off or lower than the down-regulated cut-off was considered as regulated. The cut-off values were determined based on the 2x standard deviation and the normal distribution from all identified protein’s log2 ratio in which the bell curve is symmetric around the mean. Therefore, an average log2 ratio of a protein which < -2.08 or > 2.38 (corresponding to ~5.22-fold regulation; log2 ratios of 1.10) for comparative membrane-associated profile and an average log2 ratio < -3.03 or > 2.81 (corresponding to 7.03-fold regulation; log2 ratios of 0.92) for comparative cytosolic profile were considered as regulated.	2017-10-23	"[[""PMID:29720545"",""DOI:10.1212/WNL.0000000000005566""]]"

Within GalaxyP, all raw files together (using a multifile format that has been recently changed to dataset collection) were converted to mzml format using msconvert and then into ProteinPilot compatible Mascot Generic Format (MGF) files with preselected iTRAQ reporter ions. The MGF files were searched against the target-decoy version of Human UniProt database along with contaminant protein sequences (84,838 target sequences in total; July 2014) using ProteinPilot version 4.5.  Following search parameters were used: Sample Type: iTRAQ 8-plex (peptide labeled); Cys-alkylation: MMTS; Instrument: Orbi MS, Orbi MS/MS; run quant; bias correction on; search focus on biological modifications and amino-acid substitutions; thorough search and with a detected protein threshold (Unused Protscore (Conf)): 10%. The ProteinPilot searches and subsequent generation of Proteomics System Performance Evaluation Pipeline Software (PSPEP) –FDR reports and protein and peptide level summaries were generated within Galaxy-P.   The results of multiple iTRAQ LC-MS/MS experiments were aligned to compare protein-level quantitative data using Protein Alignment Template vs. 2.00p (AB Sciex) [30]. The Protein Alignment Template provides the overlap of proteins across multiple iTRAQ LC MS/MS experiments by matching proteins in a ‘reference master list’ to the ‘test list’ of proteins identified in each individual iTRAQ LC-MS/MS run.  For this alignment, we created a reference master list by performing a database search using .RAW files from two iTRAQ LC-MS/MS experiments i.e. iTRAQ experiment 1 and 5. To ensure that the proteins in this list are of high ID quality, we used a local FDR ≤ 5% as a threshold for the reference protein list. As per the recommendation of the Protein Alignment Template, for assembling of feature table with quantitative values, the threshold of ≤ 5% global FDR was used for ‘test list’ consisting of individual sets for the five-iTRAQ LC-MS/MS experiments. The Protein Alignment Template resulted in aligning of the ratios, p-values and error factors of the proteins across replicate experiments by using accession numbers of isoforms within protein summary and UniProt database.	2015-06-29	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.bbmt.2016.04.021"",""PMID:27155584""]]"
688	PXD011103	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD011103	A non-canonical SWI/SNF complex underlies synthetic lethality in cancers driven by BAF complex perturbation	Mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes exist in three distinct, final-form assemblies: canonical BAF (cBAF), PBAF, and a newly characterized non-canonical complex, ncBAF. However, their complex-specific targeting on chromatin, functions and roles in disease remain largely unknown. Here, we comprehensively map complex assemblies on chromatin and find that ncBAF uniquely localizes to CTCF sites and promoters. We identified ncBAF subunits as major synthetic lethalities specific to human synovial sarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumor, which share in common cBAF complex perturbation. Chemical and biological depletion of the BRD9 subunit of ncBAF rapidly attenuates SS and MRT cell proliferation. Notably, in cBAF-perturbed cancers, ncBAF complexes retain localization to CTCF sites and promoters, and maintain gene expression at retained mSWI/SNF sites to support cell proliferation in a manner distinct from fusion oncoprotein-mediated targeting. Taken together, these findings unmask the unique targeting and function of ncBAF complexes and present new cancer-specific therapeutic targets.

Post-menstrual repair of the uterine endometrium is a unique cyclical manifestation of rapid, scar-free, tissue repair taking ~3-5 days. Skin repair post-wounding is slower (~2 weeks) and, in the case of chronic wounds, takes months/years to restore integrity. Herein, the unique ‘rapid-repair’ endometrial environment is translated to the ‘slower-repair’ skin environment. Menstrual fluid (MF), the milieu of post-menstrual endometrial repair, facilitates healing of endometrial and keratinocyte ‘wounds’ in vitro, promoting cellular adhesion and migration, stimulates keratinocyte migration in an ex vivo human skin-reconstruct model and promotes re-epithelialization in an in vivo porcine wound model. Proteomic analysis of MF identified a large number of proteins; several proteins were selected for further investigation, with the endometrium demonstrated as the source of these factors. Functionally, they promote repair of endometrial and keratinocyte wounds by promoting migration, differing significantly from currently available wound-repair treatments, which mainly promote proliferation. Development of these and other menstrual fluid factors into a ‘migration-inducing’ treatment paradigm will provide novel therapies for tissue repair.

The minimum required peptide length was set to 7 amino acids. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification while N-acetylation of proteins N-termini, oxidation of methionine and pyroglutamate at peptides N-termini Glu and Gln were set as variable modifications. During the MaxQuant main search, precursor ion mass error tolerance was set to 4.5 ppm and fragment ions were allowed a mass deviation of 20 ppm. PSM and protein identifications were filtered using a target-decoy approach at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. The match between runs option was enabled with a match time window of 1 min and an alignment time window of 20 min. Further analysis was performed using a custom pipeline developed in Pipeline Pilot (Biovia), which takes as input the MaxQuant output files allPeptides.txt, peptides.txt and evidence.txt. A feature was defined as the combination of peptide sequence, charge and modification. Features not found in at least half the number of replicates in each group were removed. Proteins identified from hits to the reverse database and proteins with only one unique peptide were also removed. To correct for injection volume variability, feature intensities were normalized by converting to base 10 logarithms and then multiplying each value by the ratio of maximum median intensity of all replicates over median replicate intensity.  The probability of differential expression of each feature between groups was calculated using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.  Features assigned to the same protein differ in the range of intensity due to their chemico-physical properties and charge state. To further correct for these differences, each intensity value was multiplied by the ratio of the maximum of the median intensities of all features for a protein over the median intensity of the feature. The probability of differential expression between groups was calculated using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test excluding any non-unique sequences and any features with modifications other than oxidation and carbamidomethylation.	2017-08-09	"[[""PMID:30036086"",""DOI:10.1096/fj.201800086r""]]"
694	PXD005575	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD005575	Structure of the Homodimeric Androgen Receptor Ligand-Binding Domain	The androgen receptor (AR) plays a crucial role in normal physiology, development and metabolism as well as in the etiology and treatment of diverse pathologies such as androgen insensitivity syndromes (AIS), male infertility, and prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we show that dimerization of AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) is induced by receptor agonists but not by antagonists. The 2.15-Å crystal structure of homodimeric, agonist- and coactivator peptide bound AR-LBD unveils a 1,000-Å2 large dimerization surface, which harbors over 40 previously unexplained AIS- and PCa-associated point mutations. An AIS mutation in the self-association interface (P767A) disrupts dimer formation in vivo, and has a detrimental effect on the transactivating properties of full-length AR, despite retained hormone-binding capacity. The conservation of essential residues suggests that the newly unveiled dimerization mechanism might be shared by other nuclear receptors. Our work defines AR-LBD homodimerization as an essential step in the proper functioning of this important transcription factor.

Here, we have performed a metaproteomic analysis of 103 stool samples from subjects that either had recent-onset T1D, were high-risk autoantibody positive or low-risk autoantibody negative relatives of individuals with beta cell autoimmunity or healthy individuals to identify signatures in host and microbial proteins associated with disease risk. Multivariate modelling analysis demonstrated that both human host proteins and microbial derived proteins could be used to differentiate new-onset and seropositive individuals from low-risk and healthy controls. Significant alterations were identified between subjects with T1D or islet autoimmunity versus autoantibody negative and control subjects in the prevalence of individual host proteins associated with exocrine pancreas function, inflammation and mucosal function. Data integrationIntegrative analysis combining the metaproteomic data with bacterial abundance showed that taxa that were depleted in new-onset T1D patients were positively associated with host proteins involved in maintaining function of the mucous barrier, microvilli adhesion and exocrine pancreas. These data support the notion that T1D patients have increased intestinal inflammation and decreased barrier function. They also confirmed that pancreatic exocrine dysfunction occurs in new-onset T1D patients and show for the first time that this dysfunction is present in high-risk individuals prior to disease onset. Our data has identified a unique T1D-associated signature in stool that may be useful as a means to monitor disease progression or response to therapies aimed at restoring a healthy microbiota.

For data dependent analysis, the library of 4783 SOMAmer®s were multiplexed in sets of 8 and used for enrichment of target proteins from cell lysate and conditioned media, as well as human plasma and serum.  A subset of the SOMAmer®s were screened in urine by this global profiling technique as well.  Cell lines were selected from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia for screening by comparing gene expression of the target proteins measured by RNA sequencing across the CCLE.1  Using the criterion of FPKM value greater than 5 for the target protein, the minimum number of cell lines was grown to maximize protein coverage across the SOMAmer® library.  For a given cell line, the presence of at least 8 target proteins with FPKM values greater than 5was required for inclusion.  Approximately 400 target proteins were not covered by this strategy were screened in serum and plasma only.  For enrichment from biological matrices, SOMAmer®s were combined into sets of 8 such that the potential interaction with similar proteins or binding partners was minimized.  Non-specific binding of the SOMAmer®s was assessed in each matrix by using a SOMAmer® generated against the bacterial protein CysH.  Target protein spectral counts in the SOMAmer® enriched samples were compared to the respective CysH control.  A positive hit is defined as target protein detection with a minimum of 2 spectral counts and signal over CysH background greater than 10X (if applicable).

The molecular mechanisms underlying this well-known phenomenon remain elusive. Here we report that a single bout of exercise induces marked activation of glycogen synthase (GS) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) for several days beyond normalized muscle glycogen content in man. Acute muscle specific deletion of AMPK activity in mouse muscle abrogated the ability for glycogen supercompensation, providing genetic evidence that AMPK serves as essential driver for glycogen supercompensation. Muscle proteomic analyses revealed elevated glucose uptake capacity in the prior exercised muscle while key proteins in fat oxidation and glycolysis largely remained unchanged. The temporal order of these sustained cellular alterations induced by a single bout of exercise provide a mechanism to offset the otherwise tight feedback inhibition of glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake by glycogen, ultimately leading to muscle glycogen supercompensation.

Identification of such biomarkers has hitherto been unsuccessful over a range of studies using different methods. The present study used an alternative proteomic approach to find new, potential plasma AAA biomarker candidates. Pre-fractionated plasma samples from twelve patients with AAA and eight matched controls without aneurysm were analyzed by mass spectrometry applying a tandem mass tag (TMT) technique. Eight proteins were differentially regulated in patients compared to controls, including decreased levels of the enzyme bleomycin hydrolase. The down-regulation of this enzyme was confirmed in an extended validation study using an ELISA assay. The TMT-based proteomic approach thus identified novel potential plasma biomarkers for AAA.

A database search for each set was performed with the Mascot search engine version 2.3 (Matrix Science LTD., London, United Kingdom) using the UniProtKB/Trembl database (downloaded 2012-11-19, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Switzerland) with MS peptide tolerance of 10 ppm and MS/MS tolerance of 100 millimass units (mmu). Tryptic peptides were accepted with one missed cleavage and variable modifications of methionine oxidation, cysteine methylthiolation and fixed modifications of N-terminal TMT6plex and lysine TMT6plex were selected.  The detected peptide threshold in the software was set to 1% False Discovery Rate by searching against a reversed database and the corresponding result was filtered by selecting proteins with at least one unique peptide per protein. Identified proteins were grouped by sharing the same sequences to minimize redundancy. For TMT quantification, the ratios of the TMT reporter ion intensities in MS/MS spectra ([M+H]+ m/z 126-131) from raw data sets were used to calculate fold changes between samples. The ratios were derived by Proteome Discoverer version 1.3 using the following criteria: fragment ion tolerance as 100 mmu for the most confident centroid peak, TMT reagent purity corrections factors were used and missing values were replaced with minimum intensity.

High levels of Apo-CIII strongly correlate with hypertriglyceridemia and are associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CAD). Aim of the present research was to study the plasma proteome profiles of stable CAD patients characterized by different levels of total Apo-CIII. Two subgroups of CAD patients with divergent concentrations (under and upper the median concentration of the population distribution=10mg/dL) of total circulating Apo C-III were examined using a shotgun proteomic approach. 180 plasma proteins of CAD patients were quantified and the data were analyzed by bioinformatic tools and multivariate statistics. The fold change analysis and the Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis showed a clear separation of the two groups. The dynamic processes that involve Apo C-III concentration in blood and its relation with all other plasma proteins were considered. Lipoproteins (Apo C-II and Apo E), retinol-binding protein 4 and vitronectin were up-regulated in patients with high Apo C-III, while alpha 1-antitrypsin was down-regulated. In this pilot study, the different expression of plasma proteins through the entire range of concentrations of Apo C-III was defined, suggesting possible new players involved in the APO C-III-associated process of arterial damage	"[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]"	"[""blood plasma""]"	"[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]"	"[""TripleTOF 5600""]"	"[""Biomedical""]"	"[""Shotgun proteomics"",""SWATH MS""]"		Cardiovascular disease, plasma proteomics, apolipoproteins, Apo C-III, coronary artery disease	The DDA files were searched using Protein Pilot software v. 4.2 (AB SCIEX, Concord, Canada) and Mascot v. 2.4 (Matrix Science Inc., Boston, MA, USA).

Three kinases can phosphorylate AMPK at Thr172: the tumor suppressor LKB1, CAMKK2 and TAK1.  While LKB1- and CAMKK2-mediated AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation have been well-characterized, much less is known about TAK1-dependent AMPK phosphorylation.  An important target of TAK1 is IκB kinase (IKK) which controls NF-B transcription factor activation.  Here, we tested the hypothesis that IKK acted downstream of TAK1 to activate AMPK by phosphorylating Thr172. IKK was required for phosphorylation of Thr172 in AMPK in response to treatment with IL-1 or TNF- treatment or by TAK1 overexpression.  Additionally, IKK regulated basal AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation in several cancer cell types independently of TAK1, indicating that other modes of IKK activation could lead to AMPK activation.  We found that IKK directly phosphorylated AMPK at Thr172 independently of LKB1 or energy stress.  This finding indicated that while LKB1 activates AMPK as a sensor of energetic stress, IKK activated AMPK in response to extracellular inflammatory signals and through distinct pathways downstream of IKK activation.  Accordingly, in LKB1-deficient cells, IKK inhibition caused a reduction in AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation in response to the mitochondrial inhibitor phenformin.  This response led to enhanced apoptosis and suggests that IKK inhibition in combination with phenformin could be used clinically to treat patients with LKB1-deficient cancers.

A knowledge of the significance of Nrf2 in cell function has not, as yet, reached out beyond transactivation of gene expression. This paper shows that GDF-15 and SDF-1-induced angiogenesis strongly depends on Nrf2 presence, but is not related to its transcriptional activity. We propose, that Nrf2 serves as a protein restraining Keap1, its known transcriptional repressor. Deficiency of Nrf2 protein available for Keap1 leads to overabundance of RhoGAP1, the protein regulating Cdc42 activity, and impairs podosome assembly, thereby indisposing actin rearrangements, preventing migration and angiogenesis. These activities can be rescued by concomitant deletion of RhoGAP1 or Keap1. We suggest that a new Nrf2 function of a Keap1 scavenger implies revising the established murine model of Nrf2 deficiency as a transcriptional knock out (tKO) mouse. The N-terminal fragment of Nrf2, containing Neh2 domain binding Keap1, is present in these animals. Thus, regarding the function of Nrf2 as a protein sequestering Keap1, both published and unpublished data on Nrf2-Keap1 duet may gain new interpretation.

We have recently reported cytotoxic effects of xyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate derived from a human breast carcinoma cell line, HCC70, and shown that it differs in disaccharide composition from non-toxic chondroitin/dermatan sulfate derived from a human breast fibroblast cell line, CCD-1095Sk. To further investigate the structural requirements for the cytotoxic effect, we have here developed a novel LC-MS/MS approach based on dibutylamine ion-pairing reversed-phase chromatography and negative mode higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD), and used it in combination with cell growth studies and disaccharide fingerprinting. This allowed for detailed structural characterization of linkage regions, internal oligosaccharides, and non-reducing ends, showing not only differences between xyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells and CCD-1095Sk cells, but also in sialylation of the linkage region as well as previously undescribed methylation and sulfation of the non-reducing ends. Although the xyloside-primed chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells was less complex in terms of presence and distribution of iduronic acid than that from CCD-1095Sk cells, both glucuronic acid and iduronic acid appeared essential for the cytotoxic effect. Our data have moved us one step closer to understanding the structure of the cytotoxic chondroitin/dermatan sulfate from HCC70 cells primed on xylosides, and demonstrate the suitability of the LC-MS/MS approach for structural characterization of glycosaminoglycans.

Here, we identified the extracellular matrix protein Nidogen-1 (NID1) as a ligand of NKp44, an important activating receptor expressed by activated NK cells. When released as soluble molecule, NID1 can regulate NK cell function by modulating NKp44-induced IFN-γ production or cytotoxicity.  We also show that NID1 may be present at the cell surface. In this form or when bound to a solid support (bNID1), NID1 failed to induce NK cell cytotoxicity or cytokine release. However, analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that exposure to bNID1 can induce relevant changes in the proteomic profiles suggesting an effect on different, biological processes of human NK cells.

There is no current treatment; instead, disease management targets the main symptoms (pain and stiffness) and culminates in joint replacement surgery. OA is a disease of cartilage degeneration, but the molecular changes leading to the development of OA are still poorly understood. In this study we compare methylation, gene transcription and protein abundance at the genome-wide level in individually-matched samples of chondrocytes extracted from affected and relatively healthy articular cartilage across 12 OA patients undergoing total knee replacement. Integration analysis highlights genes that are consistently affected at multiple levels, including AQP1, CLEC3B and COL1A1, and also relevant biological pathways such as extracellular matrix organization, collagen catabolism and proteolysis. Collectively these results provide a first view of the comprehensive molecular landscape underpinning OA development and point to potential therapeutic avenues.

Understanding the cellular response mechanism to heavy ion radiation is  required for exploring the measures of overcoming the devastating side  effects. Here, we performed a quantitative proteomics to investigate the  mechanism of carbon heavy ion irradiation on human AHH-1 lymphoblastoid  cells. Totally we identified 4602 proteins and quantified 4569 proteins  among which with high coverage on mitochondria. After stringent filtering,  we found 290 proteins were significantly up-regulated and 16 proteins were  down-regulated. Functional analysis revealed that these up-regulated  proteins specifically enriched in the process of DNA damage repair,  mitochondrial ribosome and especially mitochondrial respiratory chain, which  occupied approximately fifty percent of the accumulated proteins.  Bioinformatics analysis and functional study demonstrated that these up- regulated mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins enhanced ATP production  and simultaneously ROS releasing. More importantly, the increased ROS led to  organelle secondary injury and the lagged DNA double strand breaks.  Consistently, the expression of antioxidant enzymes was up-regulated for  free radical scavenging. The mechanism of lagged secondary injury originated  from disturbing of mitochondrial respiratory chain, the “target” outside  nuclear, explored here may provide a novel target for cell self-repairing  against heavy ion radiation induced cellular damage.

Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax account for over 90% of the total malaria cases worldwide. The estimated number of annual clinical cases of vivax malaria is even higher than that of falciparum malaria, but yet the morbidity associated with this infection and its spectrum of disease is largely neglected. Identification of serum/plasma proteins, which exhibit altered abundance at the onset and during the acute phase of any infection, could be informative to understand the pathobiology of different infectious diseases and host responses against the invading pathogens. To this end, in recent years, quite a few research groups including us have investigated alterations in serum/plasma proteome in severe and non-severe falciparum malaria (and also vivax malaria) to study malaria pathogenesis. In all these studies, serum/plasma proteome of the malaria patients have been analyzed during the febrile stages of the infection, either at the onset of the disease or at the fastigium stage. However, temporal profiling of serum/plasma proteome during acute and remission stages in malaria, which can provide snapshots of the transient and enduring alterations in serum proteome during the febrile, defervescence and convalescent stages has not been reported hitherto.  Here, we report, for the first time, serum proteomic alterations in a longitudinal cohort of P. vivax infected patients to elucidate host responses when fever is established (temperature of the body reaches above higher normal level), during the stage when the temperature comes down to normal, and also during the gradual recovery of health after the illness.  The three stages discussed in our study have been categorically chosen depending upon the clinical course of uncomplicated vivax malaria. Analysis of the early febrile stage represents host proteome profile immediately after onset of the infection, without any effect of anti-malarial drugs. The second, defervescence stage, reflects any immediate change in blood proteome at early recovery phase, while the convalescent stage indicates a phase after administration of 14 days radical cure treatment with primaquine and a complete recovery, when none of the patients displayed any apparent symptoms of malaria. We have also performed an extensive quantitative proteomics analysis to compare the serum proteome profiles of vivax malaria patients with low and moderately-high parasitemia with healthy community controls. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and 2-D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based quantitative proteomics approaches were used in the discovery-phase of the study, and some selected differentially abundant serum proteins were validated further by using ELISA. Interestingly, some of the serum proteins like Serum amyloid A, Apolipoprotein A1, C-reactive protein, Titin and Haptoglobin, were found to be sequentially altered with respect to increased parasite counts, while many of the quantified candidates such as Hemopexin, Vitronectin, Clusterin and Apolipoprotein E exhibited nearly equal levels of differential serum abundance in different parasitemic malaria patients. Analysis of a longitudinal cohort of malaria patients indicated reversible alterations in serum levels of some proteins such as Haptoglobin, Apolipoprotein E, Apolipoprotein A1, Carbonic anhydrase 1, and Hemoglobin subunit alpha upon treatment; however, the levels of a few other proteins did not return to the baseline even during the convalescent phase of the infection. Identification of the differentially abundant serum proteins and associated physiological pathways in vivax malaria along with phase-specific protein profiles during the acute and convalescent phases of the infection can effectively enhance our understanding of P. vivax disease biology and host immune responses.

Although the anti-cancer effects of curcumin are well established, detailed understanding of the signaling pathways altered by curcumin is still unclear. In this study, we carried out SILAC-based quantitative proteomic analysis of CAL 27 cell line, a HNSCC cell line to investigate tyrosine signaling in response to curcumin. Using high resolution Orbitrap Fusion™ Tribrid™ Fourier transform mass spectrometer, we identified 627 phosphotyrosine sites mapping to 357 proteins.

762	PXD006900	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006900	Bacterial pore-forming toxins remodel the host epithelial cell proteome	Bacterial pathogens use various strategies to interfere with host cell functions. Among these strategies, bacteria induce transcriptional changes, in order to modify the set of proteins synthetized by the host cell, or target pre-existing proteins by modulating their post-translational modifications or by triggering their degradation. Protein levels variations in host cells during infection integrates both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations induced by pathogens. Here, we focused on host proteome alterations induced by the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and more specifically the Listeria toxin Listeriolysin O (LLO).  In order to characterize host proteome alterations induced by LLO, we performed a shotgun proteomics analysis on HeLa cells treated or not with the LLO toxin. To this end, we used SILAC labelling (stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture) to compared in a quantitative manner the protein content from two differentially treated cell populations: one control population and one population incubated with a sublytic dose of LLO (3 nM). We decided to expose cells to LLO during only 20 min to limit protein level changes resulting from transcriptional changes. We performed two independent experiments (experiment #1 and experiment #2) with swapped SILAC labelling to rule out putative labelling-dependent effects. A total of 2009 and 1684 proteins was quantified in each independent experiment, respectively, and 1360 proteins were quantified in both experiments. Among these 1360 proteins, we identified a total of 91 proteins for which protein levels were consistently decreased in cells treated with LLO (i.e. with a log2 control/LLO ratio >0.5 in both experiments). To assess whether the host proteasome was involved in the decrease of these 91 proteins, we repeated our proteomics analysis on SILAC-labelled HeLa cells pre-treated with proteasome inhibitors before exposure to LLO. Two independent experiments were similarly performed with swapped SILAC labelling (experiment #3 and experiment #4). Interestingly, we observed that the vast majority of host proteins identified as strongly downregulated in response to LLO also displayed significant decreased levels in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that the majority of observed decreases in host protein levels induced by LLO are not due to proteasome-mediated degradation. In follow-up experiments, we identified that LLO decreases in particular the protein level of two E2 ubiquitin enzymes, UBE2K and UBE2N, leading to major changes in the host ubiquitylome. This toxin-induced proteome remodeling involves post-transcriptional regulations, as no modification in the transcription levels of the corresponding genes was observed. These decreases in host protein levels were observed in different epithelial cell lines but not in macrophages. In addition, we could show that Perfringolysin O, another bacterial pore-forming toxin similar to LLO, also induces host proteome changes. Taken together, our data show that different bacterial pore-forming toxins induce deep proteome remodeling, that may impair host epithelial cell functions.

For data dependent analysis, the library of 4783 SOMAmer®s were multiplexed in sets of 8 and used for enrichment of target proteins from cell lysate and conditioned media, as well as human plasma and serum.  A subset of the SOMAmer®s were screened in urine by this global profiling technique as well.  Cell lines were selected from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia for screening by comparing gene expression of the target proteins measured by RNA sequencing across the CCLE.1  Using the criterion of FPKM value greater than 5 for the target protein, the minimum number of cell lines was grown to maximize protein coverage across the SOMAmer® library.  For a given cell line, the presence of at least 8 target proteins with FPKM values greater than 5was required for inclusion.  Approximately 400 target proteins were not covered by this strategy were screened in serum and plasma only.  For enrichment from biological matrices, SOMAmer®s were combined into sets of 8 such that the potential interaction with similar proteins or binding partners was minimized.  Non-specific binding of the SOMAmer®s was assessed in each matrix by using a SOMAmer® generated against the bacterial protein CysH.  Target protein spectral counts in the SOMAmer® enriched samples were compared to the respective CysH control.  A positive hit is defined as target protein detection with a minimum of 2 spectral counts and signal over CysH background greater than 10X (if applicable).

In HeLa cells, GA inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis, as showed by results of MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis. Possible target-related proteins of GA were searched using comparative proteomic analysis (2-DE) and 9 proteins at early (3 h) stage together with 9 proteins at late (24 h) stage were found. Vimentin was the only target-related protein found at both early and late stage. Results of both 2-DE analysis and Western blotting assay suggested cleavage of vimentin induced by GA. MS/MS analysis of cleaved vimentin peptides indicated possible cleavage sites of vimentin at or near aa51 and aa425. Results of targeted proteomic analysis showed that GA induced change in phosphorylation state of the vimentin head domain (aa51-64). Caspase inhibitors could not abrogate GA-induced cleavage of vimentin. Over-expression of vimentin ameliorated cytotoxicity of GA in HeLa cells. The GA-activated signal transduction, from p38 MAPK, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), vimentin, dysfunction of cytoskeleton, to cell death, was predicted and then confirmed. Results of animal study showed that GA treatment inhibited tumor growth in HeLa tumor-bearing mice and cleavage of vimentin could be observed in tumor xenografts of GA-treated animals. Results of immunohistochemical staining also showed down-regulated vimentin level in tumor xenografts of GA-treated animals. Furthermore, compared with cytotoxicity of GA in HeLa cells, cytotoxicity of GA in MCF-7 cells with low level of vimentin was weaker while cytotoxicity of GA in MG-63 cells with high level of vimentin was stronger. These results indicated the important role of vimentin in the cytotoxicity of GA. The effects of GA on vimentin and other epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers provided suggestion for better usage of GA in clinic.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and downstream JAK/STAT signaling are thought to be central components of these microenvironment-induced phenotypes. In a prior drug repurposing screen, we identified tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor FDA-approved for rheumatoid arthritis, as an agent that may reverse the tumor-stimulating effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells.Here, we validated both in vitro, in stromal-responsive human myeloma cell lines, and in vivo, in orthotopic disseminated murine xenograft models of myeloma, that tofacitinib showed both single-agent and combination therapeutic efficacy in myeloma models.  Surprisingly, we found that ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved agent targeting JAK1 and JAK2, did not lead to the same anti-myeloma effects.  Combination with a novel irreversible JAK3-selective inhibitor also did not rescue ruxolitinib effects. RNA-seq and unbiased phosphoproteomics revealed that marrow stromal cells drive a JAK/STAT-mediated proliferative program in myeloma plasma cells, and tofacitinib reversed the large majority of these pro-growth signals. Taken together, our results suggest that tofacitinib specifically reverses the growth-promoting effects of the tumor microenvironment through blocking an IL-6-mediated signaling axis. As tofacitinib is already FDA-approved, these results can be rapidly translated into potential clinical benefits for myeloma patients.

In the present study we evaluate the contribution of the physical properties of the extracellular matrix in supporting long term culture of human islets in vitro. We used metal oxide layers with tailored nanoscale roughness to fabricate scaffolds. Their suitability to support long term culture of human islets was investigated through assessment of β-cell survival, differentiation and function by using a proteomic approach to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved. Proteomic analysis confirmed that ns-ZrOx promoted the activation of a transcriptional and translational program leading to activation of pro-survival and pro-differentiation signalling pathways. The process was driven by a mechanotransductive pathway driven by nanostructured topology, via remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton nuclear architecture and increase of oxygen sensor PDH2 Our data suggest that β-cells relay on nanotopography features to regulate their differentiation and survival.

Carbamidomethylcysteine was set as a fixed modification, N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation and serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation as variable modifications. The spectra were searched by the Andromeda search engine against the human Uniprot sequence database (release 04.07.2014) and the mouse Uniprot sequence database (release 29.06.2015). The reversed sequences of the target database were used as decoy database. Protein identification required at least one unique or razor peptide per protein group. Quantification in MaxQuant was performed using the built-in XIC-based label free quantification (LFQ) algorithm using fast LFQ. The required false positive rate was set to 1% at the peptide and 1% at the protein level against a concatenated target decoy database, and the minimum required peptide length was set to 6 amino acids. Statistical analyses were performed using the Perseus software (version 1.4.0.6, www.biochem.mpg.de/mann/tools/). Only proteins present and quantified in at least 3 out of 4 technical repeats were considered as positively identified in a sample and used for statistical analyses. An ANOVA test (false discovery rate 0.05) was carried out to identify proteins differentially expressed among the three conditions. Common proteins were considered differentially expressed if they were present only in one of the growing condition or showed significant t-test difference (cut-off at 5% permutation-based False Discovery Rate). These proteins were filtered for further analyses. We filtered out proteins known to be pancreas contaminants by comparing the proteins identified with the high quality islets proteome described in literature.

This study presents a look at the individuality of the metaproteomes from 22 medieval Danish dental calculus samples. The proteomics data suggest two distinct groups; a healthy and disease-susceptible. Comparison to modern healthy calculus samples supports this hypothesis. The osteological inspections of the samples does not immediately support the grouping made by proteomics data, making us believe that this will add a new and exciting level of information. We identify 3671 protein-groups across all medieval samples and thus expanding the depth of previous studies more than ten times. As a part of future perspective for further depth in these types of samples we performed offline high pH fractionation in combination with TMT labelling and achieved ~30% more protein identifications and reduced costly mass spectrometry time.

The data was searched against a concatenated FASTA file, consisting of the human reference proteome from UniProt, entire SwissProt (The UniProt Consortium, 2015), and the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD, (Chen et al., 2010)), retrieved August 2014, with the exception of applying no FDR cutoff. The aim was to increase peptide and protein identifications, while controlling false positives in a conservative manner. Therefore, we stratified the search space into three uneven groups, namely “human”, “bacteria”, and “other” (consisting of all “other” taxa such as food remains and peptides not mapped to kingdom level). FDR calculations were performed separately within each of these groups at the peptide level using the peptides.txt file from MaxQuant output. The FDR was calculated analogous to Cox & Mann, 2008 as follows. In order to determine a cutoff score for a specific FDR, all peptide identifications - from the forward and the reverse database - were sorted by their Andromeda-score in descending order. Peptides were accepted until 1% of reverse hits/forward hits has accumulated. In order to work with MaxQuants LFQ intensities we used the remaining “Leading razor proteins” identifiers from the peptides.txt to map and filter the proteinGroups.txt file through the “Protein IDs” column. The proteinGroups.txt was then filtered by removing all proteinGroups entries with a value of less than two “Razor + unique peptides” per rawfile.	2018-01-05	"[[""PMID:30459334"",""DOI:10.1038/s41467-018-07148-3""]]"

We identified cancer-related molecular signatures in apparently healthy bladder in patients with subsequent muscular invasiveness during follow-up. Global proteomics of the normal tissue biopsies revealed specific proteome fingerprints in these patients prior to subsequent muscular invasiveness. In these presumed normal samples, we detected modulations of proteins previously associated with different cancer types.

Loss of VHL in renal tumors also differs from tumors of other organs in that the oncogenic cascade is mediated by an increase in the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF2alpha) instead of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha).        MS/MS data generated by data dependent acquisition via the LTQ-FT were extracted by BioWorks version 3.3 and searched against a composite IPI human protein sequence database (IPI _human_v 3.73.par)  containing both forward and randomized sequences using Mascot version 2.2 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) search algorithm. Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.80 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 15.0 ppm assuming trypsin as the digestion enzyme with the possibility of one missed cleavage. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification, while oxidation of methionine, N-terminal protein acetylation, N-terminal peptide and lysine carbamoylation, and phosphorylation of serine and threonine were specified as variable modifications. The analysis of VHL-wt (Caki-2) human RCC and VHL-mut (786-O) cells was carried out from three independent, biological samples from each cell line (tryptic digests of Caki-2 and 786-O, respectively) and duplicate injections were made for each sample. Data processing was accomplished using two software tools: Scaffold (version Scaffold 3.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) and Progenesis LC-MS (version 3.0, Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, NC). Scaffold was employed to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications from Mascot database searching. Initial peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm [20]. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm [21]. Protein identifications were accepted, if they reached greater than 99% probability and contained at least 2 identified unique peptides. These identification criteria typically established < 0.01% false discovery rate based on a decoy database search strategy at the protein level.        Extracted peptide intensities were evaluated with Progenesis LC-MS to obtain label-free relative quantification from the raw data files. The software created a single aggregate run based on LC retention time of each analysis to contain all MS data with distinguished peptide ions and, then, further feature outline maps were generated for detection and quantification of peptide ions from individual analyses using default program parameters. Peptide quantifications were performed by summing peak intensities followed by normalization, data filtering to retain only ions with positive charges (z) of two and three, and exporting peak lists to query against the IPI human protein sequence database using Mascot (see Database Search subsection above). Proteins were accepted as differentially expressed following analysis of variance (ANOVA, P<0.05), requiring at least a twofold change in expression and also passing validation by Peptide Prophet and Protein Prophet using protein identifications from Scaffold.

Nakai on HepG2 Cells	Viscum coloratum (Kom.) Nakai is a variety of biological activities of medicinal plants, and the active component such as polysaccharides or alkaloids, also proved to have the effect of anti-tumor, anti-virus, anti-radiation, anti-oxidation and anti-infection. In this study, we examined the inhibition of three polysaccharide fractions from Viscum coloratum (Kom.) Nakai on HepG2 cells growth in a dose-dependent manner using CCK-8 kit assay, and flow cytometry analysis showed that VCP2 delayed cell cycle in G1 phase and induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells which may due to overexpressed p21Wafl/Cip1 and Cyclin D and decreased expressions of Cyclin E and CDK4, and the upregulated Bad, Smac and Caspase-3 and the downregulated Bcl-XL and XIAP may be one of reasons for inducing apoptosis in VCP2-treated HepG2 cells, but these effects may be not obviously related to Bad. Using iTRAQ and 2D-LC-MSMS, 113 differentially expressed proteins identified in normal and VCP2-treated HepG2 cells. Among them, the expressions of 59 proteins were upregulation, and the expressions of 54 proteins were downregulation. GO, pathways and PPI of differentially expressed proteins further analyzed in polysaccharides-treated HepG2 cells by bioinformatic approach. These findings widen our understanding the anti-tumor mechanisms of mistletoe polysaccharide and provide new clues for screening potent responsive protein to polysaccharides.

ATRA inhibits APL, breast and liver cancers by targeting isomerase Pin1, a master regulator of oncogenic signaling. Here we show that ATO targets Pin1 and cooperates with ATRA to exert potent anticancer activity. ATO inhibits and degrades Pin1, and suppresses its oncogenic function by noncovalent binding to Pin1’s active site. ATRA increases cellular ATO uptake through upregulating aquaporin-9. ATO and ATRA, at clinically safe doses, cooperatively ablate Pin1 to block numerous cancer-driving pathways and inhibit the growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells and tumor-initiating cells in cell and animal models including patient-derived orthotopic xenografts, similar to Pin1 CRISPR knockout, which is substantiated by comprehensive protein and microRNA analyses. Thus, synergistic Pin1 inhibition by ATO and ATRA offers an attractive approach to combating breast and other cancers.

Therefore it is of utmost importance to spatially characterize this tissue heterogeneity and to identify appropriate biomarkers. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can analyze spatially resolved tissue biopsies on a molecular level.   Experimental design MALDI MSI of snap frozen tissues as well as of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) were used to analyze m/z values localized in tumor and non-tumor regions. Peptide identification was performed by using liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS and immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results In both FFPE and frozen tissue specimen seven characteristic masses of the tumor epithelial region were found identified. Using LC-MS/MS, the peaks were identified as Vimentin, Keratin type II, Nucleolin, Heat shock protein 90, Prelamin-A/C, Junction plakoglobin and PGAM1. Finally, Vimentin, Nucleolin and PGAM1 were verified with IHC.  Conclusions and Clinical Relevance The combination of MALDI MSI, LC-MS/MS and subsequent IHC is an appropriate tool to characterize the molecular heterogeneity of tissue as well as to identify new representative biomarkers for a more individualized therapy.

Here we report the mechanism for activation of p53 tumor suppressor by C16-ceramide.  C16-ceramide tightly binds within the p53 DNA binding domain (Kd ~ 60 nM), in close vicinity to the Box V motif. This interaction is highly selective towards the ceramide acyl chain length with its C10 atom being proximal to Ser240 and Ser241. Ceramide binding stabilizes p53 and disrupts its complex with E3 ligase MDM2 leading to the p53 accumulation, nuclear translocation and activation of the downstream targets. This is a novel physiological mechanism of p53 activation, which is fundamentally different from the canonical p53 regulation through protein-protein interactions or post-translational modifications. The discovered mechanism is triggered by serum or folate deprivation implicating it in the cellular response to nutrient/metabolic stress.  Our study establishes C16-ceramide as the first natural small molecule activating p53 through the direct binding.

Here, we use absolute quantification with stable isotope-labeled peptides and parallel reaction monitoring to determine levels of both proteins in two human cells lines and in human colon. We report that the main \textit{MIEF1} translational product is not the canonical 463 amino acid MiD51 protein but the small 70 amino acid alternative MiD51 protein (altMiD51).

Understanding these mechanisms and developing biomarkers to identify their presence thus represents a vital goal. Towards this goal, here we report a chemoproteomic map of the covalent targets of fumarate, an oncometabolite whose accumulation marks the genetic cancer predisposition syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC). First, we validate the ability of known and novel chemoproteomic probes to report on concentration-dependent fumarate reactivity in vitro. Next, we apply these probes in concert with LC-MS/MS to identify cysteine residues sensitive to either fumarate treatment or fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation in untransformed and HLRCC cell models, respectively. Mining this data to understand the structural determinants of fumarate reactivity led to the discovery of an unexpected anti-correlation with nucleophilicity, indicating a novel influence of pH on fumarate-cysteine interactions. Finally, we show that many fumarate-sensitive and FH-regulated cysteines are found in functional protein domains, and perform functional studies of a fumarate-sensitive cysteine in SMARCC1 that lies at a key protein-protein interface in the SWI-SNF tumor suppressor complex.

The mass difference of 203 Da suggested that the protein with exp. monoisotopic [M+H]+ at 13696.9 ± 0.2 m/z could correspond to the N-acetylhexosamine (theor. monoisotopic ion at 203.1 m/z) derivative of the 13493.9 ± 0.2 m/z protein. On the other hand, the mass difference of 146 Da between the proteins with exp. monoisotopic [M+H]+ at 13843.1 ± 0.2 m/z and 13696.9 ± 0.2 m/z was in agreement with an additional deoxyhesose moiety (theor. monoisotopic ion at 146.1 m/z). Manual inspection of the high-resolution MS/MS spectra of the [M+10H]+10 ions at 1351.00, 1371.32 and 1386.11 m/z allowed to establish that the three proteins were different proteoforms of PIP with the N-terminal glutamine residue converted to pyro-glutamic acid and with two disulfide bonds, but not to assign the glycosylation site. The presence in the MS/MS spectra of low-molecular weight saccharide oxoniun ions at 204.087 and 138.106 m/z confirmed the presence of an N-acetylhexosamine moiety in the protein with [M+H]+ at 13696.9 ± 0.2 m/z.

In top-down experiments protein sequences and sites of covalent modifications were validated by manual inspection of the experimental fragmentation spectra against the theoretical ones generated by MS-Product software available at the ProteinProspector website (http://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/mshome.htm).  The relative abundance of the salivary proteins was determined by measuring the area of RP-HPLC low-resolution ESI-MS eXtracted Ion Current (XIC) peaks, considered when the S/N ratio was at least 5. This value is linearly proportional to the peptide concentration and it can be used to monitor relative abundances, under constant analytical conditions [36]. To determine reliable XIC peak area, the choice of m/z values of the protein of interest is relevant, in particular in crowded chromatographic where ESI spectra belonging to other proteins might share ions with the same m/z value. The window for all these values was in a range of ±0.5 m/z. In order to minimize errors associated with sample dilution, the XIC peak value of each protein/peptide analyzed was correct with respect to the XIC peak value of the leucine encephalin internal standard. Statistical analyses were performed with the software GraphPad Prism 6.0. Data distributions were tested for normality by D'Agostino-Pearson test. A comparison between multiple sclerosis subjects and healthy controls  was performed by using the following statistical tests depending on data distribution (normal or skewed), and variance (homogeneous or unequal): parametric t-test (variance homogeneous); t-test with Welch correction (normal distribution, variance unequal), and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test (skewed distribution, variance unequal).	2018-04-09	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.jprot.2018.07.019"",""PMID:30086402""]]"

However, their correlation has not been clarified. In this study, human atrial tissues from the patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease in either sinus rhythm or persistent AF were analyzed using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach. An up-regulation in chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) 1, 4, 5 and a rise in type IV collagen were revealed. Combined with the results from immunohistochemistry and electron microscope analysis, the distribution of type IV collagen and effects of fibrosis on myocyte membrane indicated the possible interaction between CLIC and type IV collagen, confirmed by protein structure prediction and co-immunoprecipitation. These results indicate that CLICs play an important role in the development of atrial fibrillation and that CLICs and structural type IV collagen may interact on each other to promote the development of AF in rheumatic mitral valve disease.

Here, we combined cultivation-independent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics to investigate the functional maturation of gut microbiota in faecal samples from full-term healthy infants collected at 6 and 18 months of age. Phylogenetic analysis of the metaproteomes showed that Bifidobacterium provided the highest number of distinct protein groups. Considerable divergences between taxa abundance and protein phylogeny were observed at all taxonomic ranks. Age had a profound effect on early microbiota where compositional and functional complexity of less dissimilar communities increased with time. Comparisons of the relative abundances of proteins revealed the transition of taxon-associated saccharolytic and carbon metabolism strategies from catabolic pathways of milk and mucin-derived monosaccharides feeding acetate/propanoate synthesis to complex food sugars fuelling butyrate production. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis uncovered two anti-correlated modules of functional taxa. A low-connected Bifidobacteriaceae-centred guild of facultative anaerobes was succeeded by a rich club of obligate anaerobes densely interconnected around Lachnospiraceae, underpinning their pivotal roles in microbial ecosystem assemblies. Our findings establish a framework to visualize whole microbial community metabolism and ecosystem succession dynamics, proposing opportunities for microbiota-targeted health-promoting strategies early in life.

GAC, compared to the other isoform, kidney-type glutaminase (KGA), has been characterized as more active and particularly important for cancer cell growth. Very little is known about post-translational modifications regulating GAC function. Hereby we describe the identification of a phosphorylation on the serine 95, located at the GLS N-terminus, a domain shared by both isoforms. A GAC phosphomimetic mutant (S95D) ectopically expressed in breast cancer cells presented decreased enzymatic activity, and its expression impacted on cell’s glutamine uptake, glutamate release and intracellular glutamate levels (compared to expressing wild type GAC) without changing GAC sub-cellular localization. Curiously, replacing S95 by an alanine in the ectopically expressed GAC (S95A) increased cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, these results reveal that GAC is post-translationally regulated by phosphorylation, which impacts on cancer phenotype.

820	PXD010805	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010805	Dynamic proteomics reveals unexpected plasticity of cellular proteome	In proteomics, the changes occurring in cellular proteomes upon drug treatment are used to identify the drug targets and the mechanism of action. However, proteomes of cultured cells undergo also natural alteration associated with changes in the media, attaining a degree of confluence as well as due to cell division, metabolic and circadian cycles. These changes are implicitly assumed to be minimal.  In this study, we tested this assumption experimentally by comparing the proteome dynamics of untreated HCT116 and A375 cancer cells during 48 h.

Recent advances in mass spectrometric (MS) proteome quantification techniques, exemplified by SWATH-MS, a massively parallel targeting method, now also support precise quantitative proteomic comparisons across multiple samples, thus identifying molecular and implied functional differences.   Here we used SWATH-MS to analyze the proteome profiles of a set of fresh-frozen prostate tissue samples derived from radical prostatectomy specimens. A high confidence set of 1,906 proteins were consistently quantified across 60 biopsy-level tissue samples from three prostatectomy patients, each consisting of 1.0 mm punch biopsies from histologically malignant (acinar and ductal adenocarcinoma) and matching benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues.  The quantitative protein profiles allowed independent quantification of the degree of intra-tumor heterogeneity for each protein in benign and malignant tissues. We found that while majority of the proteins showed comparably low intra-tumor variability, 122 proteins were highly variable in malignant and/or matching benign tissues. We observed that proteins that varied between patients or tissue types also tended to be highly variable within prostate tissues,  suggesting that these variability patterns will be a critical selection criterion in future protein biomarker studies. The data also permitted investigation of the heterogeneity of multiple biochemical pathways. The high variability of several of the pathways, including Glypican-1 network, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and celecoxib pathway, explained contradictory results regarding them in the literature.  In conclusion, we demonstrated a methodology for investigating proteomic intra-tumor heterogeneity from biopsy-level tissue samples, and quantified the degree of intra-tumor heterogeneity of 1,906 proteins in prostate tumors. The method and data presented here have advanced our understanding of tumor biology and offered critical insights for future biomarker development.

Uba1 was thought to be the only E1 until the recent identification of Uba6 as an alternative. To differentiate the biological functions of Uba1 and Uba6, we applied a novel orthogonal ubiquitin transfer (OUT) technology to profile their ubiquitination targets in mammalian cells. By expressing pairs of an engineered ubiquitin and engineered Uba1 or Uba6 that were generated for exclusive interactions, we identified 697 Uba6 targets and 529 Uba1 targets with 258 overlaps. Bioinformatics revealed substantial differences in pathways involving Uba1- and Uba6-specific targets. We demonstrated that polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ezrin and CUGBP1 require Uba6, but not Uba1, and Uba6 is involved in the control of ezrin localization and epithelial morphogenesis.

Here, we report on the role of SUMO in mitosis in human cell lines. Knocking down the SUMO conjugation machinery resulted in a delay in mitosis and defects in mitotic chromosome separation. Searching for relevant SUMOylated proteins in mitosis, we identified the APC/C complex, a master regulator of metaphase to anaphase transition, as a SUMO target. The APC4 subunit is the major SUMO target in the complex, containing SUMO acceptor lysines at positions 772 and 798. SUMOylation increased APC/C ubiquitylation activity towards a subset of its targets, including the newly identified target KIF18B. Intriguingly, SUMOylation of APC/C was regulated by casein kinase driven phosphorylation of serines at positions 777 and 779. Combined, our findings demonstrate the importance of SUMO signal transduction for genome integrity during mitotic progression and reveal a triad of PTMs, cooperating to drive mitosis.

Serological biomarkers to predict and diagnose PE would help antenatal care and reduce the obstetrical complications. To discover biomarkers for prediction of PE, we first performed global proteome profiling of three pairs of maternal plasma samples obtained from the early second trimester pregnant women who subsequently developed PE and controls to identify proteins that were abundant in the patients. We further evaluated the expression changes of PE representing proteins in stored plasma samples of a cohort of subsequently developed PE and their matched controls by MRM assay. We identified both Complement C1s subcomponent (p-value = 0.041) and Protein AMBP (p-value = 0.043) were up-regulated in the cohort of PE plasma samples before manifestation of clinical disease. We propose that these proteins may be involved in the remodeling process of the spiral arteries even before the manifestation of PE. These proteins could be served as potential plasma biomarkers to predict pregnant women at increased risk of developing PE.

Here, we report the discovery of deubiquitinating activity in ZUFSP/C6orf113. High-resolution crystal structures of ZUFSP in complex with ubiquitin reveal several distinctive features of ubiquitin recognition and catalysis. Our analyses reveal that ZUFSP is a novel DUB with no homology to any known DUBs, leading us to classify ZUFSP as the seventh DUB family. Intriguingly, the minimal catalytic domain does not cleave polyubiquitin. We identify two new ubiquitin binding domains in ZUFSP: a ZHA (ZUFSP helical arm) that binds to the distal ubiquitin and an atypical UBZ domain in ZUFSP that binds to polyubiquitin. Importantly, both domains are essential for ZUFSP to selectively cleave K63-linked polyubiquitin. We show that ZUFSP localizes to DNA lesions, where it plays an important role in genome stability pathways, functioning to prevent spontaneous DNA damage and also promote cellular survival in response to exogenous DNA damage.

Mucosal biopsies were obtained from children undergoing baseline diagnostic endoscopy prior to therapeutic interventions. Using a super-stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based approach, the proteomes of 99 paediatric control and biopsies of patients with CD and UC were compared. Multivariate analysis of a subset of these (n=50) was applied to identify novel biomarkers, which were validated in a second subset (n=49). In the discovery cohort, a panel of five proteins was sufficient to distinguish control from IBD-affected tissue biopsies with an AUC of 1.0 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.0); a second panel of 12 proteins segregated inflamed CD from UC within an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.0). Application of the two panels to the validation cohort resulted in accurate classification of 95.9% (IBD from control) and 80% (CD from UC) of patients. 116 proteins were identified to have correlation with the severity of disease, four of which were components of the two panels, including visfatin and metallothionein-2. This study has identified two panels of candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of IBD and the differentiation of IBD subtypes to guide appropriate therapeutic interventions in paediatric patients.

Parameters used were: cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification; methionine oxidation and acetylation (protein N-termini) as variable modifications; enzyme specificity as trypsin with a maximum of two missed cleavages; heavy Lys-8 and Arg-10 as isotopic labels; minimum peptide length of seven amino acids; ion mass tolerance of 0.5 Da; protein and peptide false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%.   The MaxQuant output protein group file was imported into Perseus (version 1.3.0.4) for data filtering, log2 transformation, basic statistical analysis (ANOVA, T-test, Pearson correlation, hierarchical clustering) of the normalized ratios versus SILAC reference cell lysates, and for protein group annotation (KEGG, GOBP, Keywords). Only proteins that were quantified by 2 or more unique peptides were included in further analyses. The variance for each biopsy proteome was calculated, and Robust regression and Outlier (ROUT 4) applied in Prism (Graphpad) to identify any biopsies for which the variance, and thus the MS quality of the data, are significantly different from the population. Outliers were removed prior to statistical analysis.  To ensure consistency of the MS data over time, the patterns of relative expression of proteins within all biopsy proteomes were compared. To avoid inherent issues associated with MS undersampling5, or sample preparation variation, the top 25% most abundant proteins were identified by total intensity, and the log2 ratios of these were evaluated by heat map and hierarchical clustering. Pearson correlation between all proteomes was performed (Perseus) to ensure no gross proteomic differences were apparent between samples.  The entire proteome was segregated for subgroup analysis in Excel (Microsoft). Proteins with a relative contribution to protein ID by a given subgroup was determined, and those proteins that represent > 70% of the relative contribution and having identification in <50% of subgroup biopsies were considered to be potentially relevant and included in all further analyses (“subgroup specific”). Data sets with limited immunological proteins were created by removing all proteins that had the terms “immun” or “inflam” in the categories of GOBP, KEGG, Fasta, or Keyword. To evaluate proteins that are significantly different between non-IBD controls and IBD proteomes, sample data from CoA CD and UC biopsies were merged as the IBD group. The Q95 was calculated based upon each subgroup being analyzed, wherein proteins included were quantified in ≥95% of the biopsies for that analysis; the subgroup specific proteins were added to the Q95 for further processing. Missing value imputation and principle component analysis, using knnimpute and princomp respectively, were performed with MatLab.   To determine the minimum number of patients required for accurate diagnosis at the discovery stage, iterative analysis with Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analyses (PLSDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) was applied. It was determined that a minimum of 30 IBD subjects were required to ensure the greatest consistency in the accuracy of diagnosis (supplementary figure 4). Thus, a balanced stratification approach for gender and diagnosis (Etcetera in WinPepi, BrixtonHealth.ca) was applied for the random assignment of patient biopsies to either the discovery or validation cohort. After allocation, the Q95 and subgroup specific proteins of each cohort were determined.  The proteomics data from the discovery cohort was analyzed by PLSDA, SVM and RF in the ROC Explorer module of Roccet6 for candidate biomarker selection and testing. For each model, the performance is tested with repeated random sub-sampling cross validation with 2/3 of the samples used for training and 1/3 for testing, with 50 permutations. Ultimately, the candidate biomarkers that were selected were identified as significant in all three models, and ranked by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value (starting with the highest).	2016-10-03	"[[""PMID:27216938"",""DOI:10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310705""]]"

For data dependent analysis, the library of 4783 SOMAmer®s were multiplexed in sets of 8 and used for enrichment of target proteins from cell lysate and conditioned media, as well as human plasma and serum.  A subset of the SOMAmer®s were screened in urine by this global profiling technique as well.  Cell lines were selected from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia for screening by comparing gene expression of the target proteins measured by RNA sequencing across the CCLE.1  Using the criterion of FPKM value greater than 5 for the target protein, the minimum number of cell lines was grown to maximize protein coverage across the SOMAmer® library.  For a given cell line, the presence of at least 8 target proteins with FPKM values greater than 5was required for inclusion.  Approximately 400 target proteins were not covered by this strategy were screened in serum and plasma only.  For enrichment from biological matrices, SOMAmer®s were combined into sets of 8 such that the potential interaction with similar proteins or binding partners was minimized.  Non-specific binding of the SOMAmer®s was assessed in each matrix by using a SOMAmer® generated against the bacterial protein CysH.  Target protein spectral counts in the SOMAmer® enriched samples were compared to the respective CysH control.  A positive hit is defined as target protein detection with a minimum of 2 spectral counts and signal over CysH background greater than 10X (if applicable).

CAR-expressing T (CAR-T) cells have demonstrated significant efficacy for the treatment of refractory B cell malignancies and are being evaluated as immunotherapeutic reagents for many other cancers. CAR designs are based on the fundamental principles of TCR recognition and most CARs employ the T cell-activating CD3z endodomain alongside a costimulatory domain from CD28 or 4-1BB. However, emerging data suggest that CD28/CD3z and 4-1BB/CD3z signaling modules promote divergent metabolic pathways, gene expression programs, and cell fates. To determine how CAR phosphoprotein signaling drives these disparate cell fates, we analyzed CAR ligation-induced signaling networks in primary human T cells using shotgun mass spectrometry. We isolated CD8+CD62L+ T cells from healthy donors and introduced a CD28/CD3z or 4-1BB/CD3z CAR by lentiviral transduction. Transduced T cells were purified by FACS and expanded once in vitro. When the cells returned to a resting state, CD28/CD3z or 4-1BB/CD3z CAR-T cells were stimulated for 10 or 45 minutes with magnetic microbeads coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for a 9 amino acid tag in the CAR extracellular sequence. CAR-T cells were also left unstimulated for 10 or 45 minutes to serve as controls. Altogether, 8 unique conditions were tested in an experiment and three independent experiments were performed.

For data dependent analysis, the library of 4783 SOMAmer®s were multiplexed in sets of 8 and used for enrichment of target proteins from cell lysate and conditioned media, as well as human plasma and serum.  A subset of the SOMAmer®s were screened in urine by this global profiling technique as well.  Cell lines were selected from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia for screening by comparing gene expression of the target proteins measured by RNA sequencing across the CCLE.1  Using the criterion of FPKM value greater than 5 for the target protein, the minimum number of cell lines was grown to maximize protein coverage across the SOMAmer® library.  For a given cell line, the presence of at least 8 target proteins with FPKM values greater than 5was required for inclusion.  Approximately 400 target proteins were not covered by this strategy were screened in serum and plasma only.  For enrichment from biological matrices, SOMAmer®s were combined into sets of 8 such that the potential interaction with similar proteins or binding partners was minimized.  Non-specific binding of the SOMAmer®s was assessed in each matrix by using a SOMAmer® generated against the bacterial protein CysH.  Target protein spectral counts in the SOMAmer® enriched samples were compared to the respective CysH control.  A positive hit is defined as target protein detection with a minimum of 2 spectral counts and signal over CysH background greater than 10X (if applicable).

Mutations in SPOP, the gene most frequently point-mutated in primary prostate cancer, are associated with a high degree of genomic instability and deficiency in homologous recombination repair of DNA but the underlying mechanisms. SPOP knockdown leads to spontaneous replication stress and impaired recovery from replication fork stalling. An SPOP interactome analysis shows that wild type (WT) SPOP but not mutant SPOP associates with multiple proteins involved in transcription, mRNA splicing and export. Consistent with the association of SPOP with transcription, splicing and RNA export complexes, the decreased expression of several components of the DNA damage response pathway occurs at the level of transcription.

Mutations in the mitochondrial genome maintenance exonuclease 1 (MGME1) gene were recently reported in mitochondrial disease patients. Here, to study disease pathophysiology, we generated Mgme1 knockout mice and report that homozygous knockouts develop depletion and multiple deletions of mtDNA. The mtDNA replication stalling phenotypes vary dramatically in different tissues of Mgme1 knockout mice. Mice with MGME1 deficiency accumulate a long linear subgenomic mtDNA species, similar to the one found in mtDNA mutator mice, but do not develop progeria. This finding resolves a long-standing debate by showing that point mutations of mtDNA are the main cause of progeria in mtDNA mutator mice. We also propose a role for MGME1 in the regulation of replication and transcription termination at the end of the control region of mtDNA.

However, the substrates and mechanisms involved in this pathway of error correction remain poorly understood. Using a chemically tuned kinetochore-targeting assay, we show that Mps1 destabilizes microtubule attachments (K-fibers) epistatically to Aurora B, the other major error-correcting kinase. Through chemical genetics and quantitative proteomics, we identify both known and novel sites of Mps1- regulated phosphorylation at the outer kinetochore. Modification of these substrates was sensitive to microtubule tension and counterbalanced by the PP2A-B56 phosphatase, a positive regulator of chromosome-spindle interactions. Consistently, Mps1 inhibition rescued K-fiber stability after depleting PP2A-B56. We also identify the hinge region of the W-shaped Ska complex as a key effector of Mps1 at the kinetochore-microtubule interface, as mutations that mimic constitutive phosphorylation strongly destabilized K-fibers in vivo and inhibited the Ska complex’s conversion from lattice diffusion to end-coupled microtubule binding in vitro. Together these results provide new insights into how Mps1 modulates the microtubule-binding properties of the kinetochore to promote the selective stabilization of bipolar attachments and error-free chromosome segregation.

Here we use crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to chart the interactome of intact human nuclei. We overall identified ~8700 crosslinks, of which 2/3 represent links connecting distinct proteins. From this data we constructed an overview of the nuclear interactome. We observed that the histone proteins on the nucleosomes expose well-defined crosslinking hot-spots. For several nucleosome-interacting proteins, such as USF3 and Ran GTPase, the data allowed us to build models of their binding mode to the nucleosome. For HMGN2 the data guided the construction of a refined model of the interaction with the nucleosome, based on complementary NMR, XL-MS and modeling. Excitingly, several isoform-specific interactors seem to exist for distinct histone H1 variants and the analysis of crosslinks carrying post-translational modifications allowed us to extract how specific modifications influence the nucleosome interactome. Overall, our data depository will support future structural and functional analysis of cell nuclei, including the nucleoprotein assemblies they harbor.

In order to obtain accurate data, we evaluated the use of two different stable isotopes of the same peptide as spike-in for absolute quantification. For this purpose, peptide labeling by reductive amination was applied, which is a mild reaction for dimethylation of amine groups with very high yield and very little side reactions. Furthermore, three different forms can be generated with e.g., light and heavy labels for spike-in peptides, and medium label for endogenous peptides. The addition of the dimethylated proteotypic peptide in two different versions allows to determine the accuracy of the quantification of endogenous peptides using the relative ratio of the intensities of the two internal standards. The method was studied with peptides of apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B-100, and leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein without and with serum. In serum, the endogenous protein concentrations were accurately measured across four orders of magnitude by the two-point quantitation method. Less than 20% of coefficient of variation (CV) values and strong correlation with R2 of 0.99 across three analytical replicates was observed. The results showed that the accuracy to determine the amount of endogenous peptides can be validated using two references against each other, which cannot be obtained by one-point quantitation. Because of the significant lower costs than synthetic stable isotopically labeled peptides, this approach might be particularly interesting for the absolute quantitation of multiple proteins.

FZDs are classified as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which control a wide variety of physiological functions. GPCRs are well known to be regulated by phosphorylation, which can lead to specification of downstream signaling or receptor desensitization. The role and underlying mechanisms of phosphorylation of FZDs remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the phosphorylation of human FZD6.

We purified endogenous ER using an approach termed RIME (rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins) and discovered the interactome under agonist- and antagonist-liganded conditions in breast cancer cells, revealing transcriptional networks in breast cancer. The most estrogen-enriched ER interactor is GREB1, a potential clinical biomarker with no known function. GREB1 is shown to be a chromatin-bound ER coactivator and is essential for ER-mediated transcription, because it stabilizes interactions between ER and additional cofactors. We show a GREB1-ER interaction in three xenograft tumors, and using a directed protein-protein approach, we find GREB1-ER interactions in half of ER+ primary breast cancers. This finding is supported by histological expression of GREB1, which shows that GREB1 is expressed in half of ER+ cancers, and predicts good clinical outcome. These findings reveal an unexpected role for GREB1 as an estrogen-specific ER cofactor that is expressed in drug-sensitive contexts.        Additional information: All microarray data have been deposited in the GEO database with the accession number GSE37386. All ChIP-seq data have been deposited in the GEO database with the accession number GSE41561.         RawMSdata files were processed using Proteome Discoverer v.1.3 (Thermo Scientific). Processed files were searched against the SwissProt human database using the Mascot search engine version 2.3.0. Searches were done with tryptic specificity allowing up to one miscleavage and a tolerance on mass measurement of 10 ppm in MS mode and 0.6 Da for MS/MS ions. Structure modifications allowed were oxidized methionine, and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues, which were searched as variable modifications. Using a reversed decoy database, false discovery rate (FDR) was less than 1%. Detailed results including peptide sequences, peptide scores, ion scores, expect values, and Mascot scores have been included in Table S1. SILAC data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer v.1.3. This analysis only uses unique peptides for ratio analysis. The resulting fold-change ratios for proteins found in both replicates were then converted into log fold-change ratios as represented in the figures. In a few instances where protein ratios were absent due to signal from only one of the two channels, these were ranked highest in the log fold-change table following manual inspection of the raw data (MS and MS/MS) to confirm specificity to a single label.

Repeat expansions in C9ORF72, the major cause of ALS, reduce C9ORF72 levels but how this impacts stress granules is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that C9ORF72 associates with the autophagy receptor p62 and controls elimination of stress granules by autophagy. This requires p62 to associate via the Tudor protein SMN with proteins, including FUS, that are symmetrically arginine-methylated by PRMT5. Mice lacking p62 accumulate arginine-methylated proteins and alterations in FUS-dependent splicing.  Finally, patients with C9ORF72 repeat expansions accumulate symmetric arginine dimethylated proteins which co-localize with p62. This suggests that C9ORF72 initiates a cascade of ALS-linked proteins (C9ORF72, p62, SMN, FUS) to recognize stress granules for degradation by autophagy and hallmarks of a defect in this process are observable in ALS patients.

They are largely met in high-flow rate chromatographic systems for small molecules but these are not sufficiently sensitive for proteomics applications. Here we describe a new concept that delivers on these requirements while maintaining the sensitivity of current nano-flow LC systems. Low-pressure pumps elute the sample from a disposable trap column, simultaneously forming a chromatographic gradient that is stored in a long storage loop. An auxiliary gradient creates an offset, ensuring the re-focusing of the peptides before the separation on the analytical column by a single high-pressure pump. This simplified design enables robust operation over thousands of sample injections. Furthermore, the steps between injections are performed in parallel, reducing overhead time to a few minutes and allowing analysis of more than 200 samples per day. From fractionated HeLa cell lysates, deep proteomes covering more than 130,000 sequence unique peptides and close to 10,000 proteins were rapidly acquired. Using this data as a library, we demonstrate quantitation of 5200 proteins in only 21 min. Thus, the new system - termed Evosep One - analyzes samples in an extremely robust and high throughput manner, without sacrificing in depth proteomics coverage.

Their lifespan in the blood stream is around 120 days. The turnover implies the production of 2 million new reticulocytes each second. Circulating reticulocytes achieve their maturation in 2 to 3 days. During this short time, important modifications occur such as membrane remodeling, removing of remaining organelles and specific elimination of useless proteins such as the transferrin receptor. This remodeling will ensure the optimization of the erythrocyte ability to fulfil its transport functions. We performed a deep label-free quantitative proteome analysis of purified erythrocytes and reticulocytes to better understand the physiology of the erythrocytes and the last steps of their maturation.

Despite improvements in treatment strategy, the survival rates of HNSCC patients remains poor. Thus, it is necessary to identify biomarkers that can be used for early detection of disease. In this study, we employed iTRAQ-based quantitative mass spectrometry analysis to identify dysregulated proteins from a panel of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. We identified 2,468 proteins, of which 496 proteins were found to be dysregulated in at least two HNSCC cell lines compared to immortalized normal oral keratinocytes. We detected increased expression of replication protein A1 (RPA1) and heat shock protein family H (Hsp110) member 1 (HSPH1), in HNSCC cell lines compared to control. The differentially expressed proteins were further validated using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and western blot analysis in HNSCC cell lines. Immunohistochemistry-based validation using HNSCC tissue microarrays revealed overexpression of RPA1 and HSPH1 in 15.7% and 32.2% of the tested cases, respectively.

However, the analysis of in vivo O-linked glycosylation, a major type of protein glycosylation, has been severely impeded by the scarcity of technology. Here, a chemoenzymatic method was presented for the site-specific extraction of O-linked glycopeptides (EXoO), which achieved simultaneous enrichment and unambiguous mapping of over 3,000 O-linked glycosylation sites and corresponding O-linked glycans on over 1,000 proteins in human kidney tissues, serum and T cells. The large-scale localization of O-linked glycosylation sites nearly doubles the sites identified in the last decades demonstrating that EXoO is the most effective method to-date for defining the site-specific O-linked glycoproteome in different types of sample.  Structural analysis of the sites revealed conserved motifs and topological orientation facing extracellular space or lumen of ER and Golgi. Striking signature of aberrant in vivo O-linked glycoproteome was observed between kidney tumor and normal tissues discovering key factors in tumor biology. The O-linked glycoproteome play diverse roles on the ER, Golgi membrane, cell surface and extracellular space arguing that EXoO can be applied broadly to the analysis of O-linked glycoproteins in biology and therapeutics.

The interplay between host and chlamydia is highly complex, and to obtain panoramic view of the functional interplay, we performed combinatorial global phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic analyses of C. trachomatis-induced signaling. We identified numerous previously unknown C. trachomatis phosphoproteins and C. trachomatis-regulated host phosphoproteins that are substrates of kinases involved in various cellular processes. Interestingly, several host transcription factors (TFs) that are phosphorylated in C. trachomatis infections, including ETS2 repressor factor (ERF), proto-oncogenic transcription factor ETS1 are targets of ERK MAPK signaling. While these TFs were found to be essential for Chlamydia development, we demonstrated their involvement in inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in C. trachomatis infected cells by transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cellular motility and invasion. Our data reveals substantially unexplored complexity of C. trachomatis-induced signaling and provides broader insights into pro-carcinogenic potential of C. trachomatis.

However, there are conflicting results regarding the nature of exRNA. Here, we have separated two distinct exRNA profiles released by mast cells, here termed high-density (HD) and low-density (LD) exRNA. The exRNA in both fractions was characterized by microarray and next-generation sequencing. Both exRNA fractions contained mRNA and miRNA, and the mRNAs in the LD exRNA correlated closely with the cellular mRNA, whereas the HD mRNA did not. Furthermore, the HD exRNA was enriched in lincRNA, antisense RNA, vault RNA, snoRNA, and snRNA with little or no evidence of full-length 18S and 28S rRNA. The LD exRNA was enriched in mitochondrial rRNA, mitochondrial tRNA, tRNA, piRNA, Y RNA, and full-length 18S and 28S rRNA. The proteomes of the HD and LD exRNA-containing fractions were determined with LC-MS/MS and analysed with Gene Ontology term finder, which showed that both proteomes were associated with extracellular vesicles. Additionally, the proteins in the HD fractions tended to be associated with the nucleus and ribosomes, whereas the LD fraction proteome tended to be associated with the mitochondrion. We show that the two exRNA signatures released by a single cell type can be separated by floatation on a density gradient. These results show that cells can release multiple types of exRNA with substantial differences in RNA species content. This is important for any future studies determining the nature and function of exRNA released from different cells under different conditions.

We have generated transcriptome profiles from RP11 (PRPF31-mutated) patient-derived retinal organoids and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), as well as Prpf31+/- mouse tissues, which revealed that disrupted alternative splicing occurred for specific splicing programmes. Mis-splicing of genes encoding pre-mRNA splicing proteins was limited to patient-specific retinal cells and Prpf31+/- mouse retinae and RPE. Mis-splicing of genes implicated in ciliogenesis and cellular adhesion was associated with severe RPE defects that include disrupted apical-basal polarity, reduced trans-epithelial resistance and phagocytic capacity, and decreased cilia length and incidence. Disrupted cilia morphology also occurred in patient-derived photoreceptors, associated with progressive degeneration and cellular stress. In situ gene-editing of a pathogenic mutation rescued protein expression and key cellular phenotypes in RPE and photoreceptors, providing proof-of-concept for future therapeutic strategies.

Prediction and diagnosis of iDILI remain a great challenge, as current models provide unsatisfying results in terms of sensitivity, specificity and prognostic value. The absence of appropriate tools for iDILI detection also impairs the development of reliable biomarkers. Here, we report on a new method for identification of drug-specific biomarkers. We combined the advantages of monocyte-derived hepatocyte-like (MH) cells, able to mimic individual characteristics, with those of a novel mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics technology to assess potential biomarkers for Diclofenac-induced DILI. We found over 2700 proteins differentially regulated in MH cells derived from individual patients. Herefrom, we identified integrin beta 3 (ITGB3) to be specifically upregulated in Diclofenac-treated MH cells from Diclofenac-DILI patients compared to control groups. Finally, we validated ITGB3 by flow cytometry analysis of whole blood and histological staining of liver biopsies derived from patients diagnosed with Diclofenac-DILI. In summary, our results show that biomarker candidates can be identified by proteomics analysis of MH cells. Application of this method to a broader range of drugs in the future will exploit its full potential for the development of drug-specific biomarkers.

In this report, we have systematically evaluated the glycan composition, structural distribution and topology of glycosylation for two high-yield candidate reassortant vaccines (NIBRG-121xp and NYMC-X181A) by combining various enzymatic digestions with high performance liquid chromatography and multiple-stage mass spectrometry. Proteomic data analyses of the full-length protein sequences determined 9 N-glycosylation sites of hemagglutinin, and defined 6 N-glycosylation sites and the glycan structures of low abundance neuraminidase, which were occupied by high-mannose, hybrid and complex-type N-glycans. A total of ~300 glycopeptides were analyzed and manually validated by tandem mass spectrometry. The unique N-glycan structure and topological location of these N-glycans are highly correlated to the spatial protein structure and the residential ligand binding. Interestingly, sulfation, fucosylation and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine of N-glycans were also reliably identified at the specific glycosylation sites of the two influenza proteins that may serve a crucial role in regulating the protein structure and increasing the protein abundance of the influenza virus reassortants.

Repeat expansions in C9ORF72, the major cause of ALS, reduce C9ORF72 levels but how this impacts stress granules is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that C9ORF72 associates with the autophagy receptor p62 and controls elimination of stress granules by autophagy. This requires p62 to associate via the Tudor protein SMN with proteins, including FUS, that are symmetrically arginine-methylated by PRMT5. Mice lacking p62 accumulate arginine-methylated proteins and alterations in FUS-dependent splicing.  Finally, patients with C9ORF72 repeat expansions accumulate symmetric arginine dimethylated proteins which co-localize with p62. This suggests that C9ORF72 initiates a cascade of ALS-linked proteins (C9ORF72, p62, SMN, FUS) to recognize stress granules for degradation by autophagy and hallmarks of a defect in this process are observable in ALS patients.

Amyloid deposits were isolated from two corneal specimens with atypical LCD type 1 due to a A546D/P551Q mutation in TGFBI using laser capture microdissection and a subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The findings were compared to the previous findings of a A546D LCD type 1 plaque proteome. Proteolytic processing of TGFBIp was addressed by counting peptide spectra obtained during the mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. Lastly, to study the effect of the P551Q substitution, recombinant FAS1-4 variants (wild type, A546D, A546D/P551Q, and P551Q) were expressed, purified and subjected to in vitro stability assays including circular dichroism, transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis, and limited proteolysis. Plaque proteomes of the two A546D/P551Q LCD type 1 cases were similar to each other as well as to A564D plaque proteome previously reported. Major proteins associated with the deposits were TGFBIp, serum amyloid P, clusterin, HtrA1, Apolipoproteins A-1, A-IV, D, and E. Proteolytic processing of TGFBIp were also similar in all LCD type 1 cases regardless of the mutation indicating that a C-terminal TGFBIp polypeptide had accumulated in the deposits. The stability assays revealed a minor destabilization of FAS1-4 upon the addition of the P551Q mutation, however, enough to result in different accessibility to proteolytic processing by trypsin for the A546D and A546D/P551Q FAS1-4 variants. Difference in A546D and A546D/P551Q LCD type 1 phenotypes is not ascribed to altered plaque formation or altered proteolytic processing of TGFBIp. Instead, a small decrease in thermodynamic stability introduced by the P551Q mutation is believed to affect TGFBIp fibrillation and proteolytic accessibility of TGFBIp, thereby resulting in the different phenotypes observed in vivo. *Data handling:* Raw data were converted to mgf format using Protein Pilot software (AB Sciex) and searched using an in-house Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version: 2.3.02) against the Swiss-Prot database (version: 2012_05). Enzyme was set to semi-trypsin, and missed cleavage was 1. No fixed modifications were added. Instead oxidation of methionine and proline were included as variable modifications. The MS tolerance and MS/MS tolerance were 10 ppm and 0.4 Da, respectively. Duo, triple, and quadric charges of precursor ions were selected and an ESI-QUAD-TOF system was set as the instrument used. All data sets were simultaneously searched against the decoy database to apply a false discovery rate (FDR) between 1.5 to 7% and a p-value < 0.01. Peptides with an ion score lower than 30 were rejected. Peptide spectra for protein hits identified by only one peptide were manually inspected, thereby reducing the FDR value. In these cases, only spectra with at least three consecutive y or b ions with high intensities were considered valid.

Allicin induces apoptosis or necrosis in a dose-dependent manner but sublethal doses influence cellular metabolism and signalling cascades. Oxidation of protein thiols and depletion of the glutathione pool are thought to be responsible for allicin’s physiological effects. Here, we studied the effect of Allicin on post-translational thiol-modification in human Jurkat cells using shotgun LC-MS/MS analyses. We identified 332 proteins in the human Jurkat cell proteome that were modified by S-thioallylation which causes a mass shift of 72 Dalton on cysteines. Many S-thioallylated proteins are high abundant proteins, including the cytoskeletal proteins tubulin, actin, cofilin, filamin and plastin-2, the heat shock chaperones HSP90 and HSPA4, the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH, ALDOA, PKM as well the protein translation factor EEF2. We confirmed that Allicin disrupted the actin cytoskeleton in mouseL929 fibroblasts. Allicin further resulted in Zn2+ release from proteins and stimulated the Zn2+-dependent IL1-triggered release of IL2 in murine EL4 T-cells. Allicin further caused inhibition of enolase activity. In conclusion, our study revealed the overall extent of widespread S-thioallylation in the human Jurkat cell proteome after allicin exposure which affects essential  cellular functions of selected allicin targets.

The two main lung cancer types are small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-SCLC (NSCLC), where NSCLC comprises about 80-85% of all lung cancer. Despite the introduction of improved treatments, the overall survival rate of lung cancer patients remains low. Further elucidation of the regulatory network perturbations between cancer-related genes and proteins is one promising route to alter this mortality trend. The deregulation of the DNA replication, cell cycle, proliferation and migration are the common factors that are involved in cancer development and progression, and therefore logical targets for analysis.  Minichromosome maintenance 2(MCM2) is a DNA replication licensing factor, which belongs to the heterohexameric MCM2-7 complex. MCM2 has been proposed as an excellent proliferation marker in many types of cancer. Our study will establish a global functional distribution of identified proteins in silenced-MCM2 in H1299 NSCLC by the means of iTRAQ. Understanding the molecular basis of MCM2 in lung cancer cells enables us to discover alternative target for lung cancer therapy.

The precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance was set to 50 mmu to prevent precursor interference. Dynamic modifications were set as carbamidomethyl (C), oxidation (M), iTRAQ4plex (K), and iTRAQ4plex (N-term). The strict target false discovery rate (FDR) of the decoy database search was set at 0.01, and the relaxed target FDR was set at 0.05. The intensity of peptide assigned by corresponding iTRAQ reporter ions (m/z = 114, 115, 116, and 117), was extracted using Proteome Discoverer. Only peptides satisfying the following criteria were considered as qualified peptides and subjected to further analyses: (1) the peptide is labeled with iTRAQ tags and (2) the peptide is considered as confidently identified (FDR < 0.05).  The raw quantitation values of each iTRAQ tag all peptides were exported from Proteome Discoverer and analyzed with R language (http://www.r-project.org). The normalization was performed according to the assumption that the abundances of peptides labeled with different iTRAQ were equal and all log ratios of the peptides between silenced MCM2 and control were normally distributed. For peptides labeled with iTRAQ tag X, the peptide abundances were multiplied by normalization factor NX, which is expressed as −MX NX = 2 where MX denotes the median of all log2 transformed iTRAQ ratios, which represents the relative peak intensity of the iTRAQ tag X signature ion m/z 114, 115, 116, or 117 to the iTRAQ signature ion m/z 114. Normalized peptide iTRAQ signals were used for calculating protein abundance.	2016-03-06	"[[""DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-13440-x"",""PMID:29038488""]]"

The cell line under study was 82 (6), and the variant identifications were counted in the union of the 6 biological replicates. The assumption was that the bigger databases corresponding to lower confidence thresholds (or no threshold for the case of raw database) contain more false matches that cannot be confirmed at the proteome level. However, it turned out that the number of identified variant peptides grows almost linearly with the increase in the database size. The effect of the database size on the number of false identification was studied by searching one LC-MS/MS replicate of the same cell line against its own databases and against the united databases of all other cell lines. The variant peptides of other databases present also in the database of cell line 6 (level 0 or raw) were excluded. The exclusion of variants present in database 6lev0 from the ""wrong database search"" results leads to a substantial number of variant identifications, while the exclusion of the variants present in ""raw"" database of cell line 6 resulted in few (0 to 3) false variant identifications even for large variant database sizes. This means that the list of variant sequences in level 0 database is not complete, and the use of unfiltered databases is preferable. Open search implying wide precursor mass window and small fragment mass tolerance is used to define the modification pattern in LC-MS/MS datasets. In this work such search was performed using X!Tandem with precursor mass accuracy of 500 Da in order to find the most frequent mass shifts mimicking single amino acid substitutions.

Recently, research has focused on early-passage dermal papilla cells (DPCs), which have hair inducing activity both in vivo and in vitro. Our previous study indicated that factors secreted from early-passage DPCs contribute to hair follicle (HF) regeneration. To identify which factors are responsible for HF regeneration and why late-passage DPCs lose this potential，we collected 48-h-culture medium (CM) from both of passage 3 and 9 DPCs and subcutaneously injected the DPC-CM into NU/NU mice. Passage 3 DPC-CM induced HF regeneration, based on the emergence of a white hair coat, but passage 9 DPC-CM not. In order to identify the key factors responsible for hair inductive capacity, CM from passage 3 and 9 DPCs was analyzed by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic technology. We identified 1360 proteins, of which 213 proteins were differentially expressed between CM from early-passage vs. late-passage DPCs, including SDF1, MMP3, biglycan and LTBP1.Further analysis indicated that the differentially-expressed proteins regulated the Wnt, TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways, which directly and indirectly participate in HF morphogenesis and regeneration. Subsequently, we selected 19 proteins for further verification by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) between the two types of CM. These results would be used to identify the key factors for inducing HF regeneration and reveal the molecular mechanisms of losing inductive ability of DPCs. Furthermore, it is possible to explore some drugs for alopecia in the clinic according to this secretome date analysis.

For protein identification, a mass tolerance of 0.05 Da was permitted for intact peptide masses, and 0.1 Da for fragmented ions, with allowance for one missed cleavage in the trypsin digests. Gln->pyro-Glu (N-term Q), oxidation (M), and deamidated (NQ) were the potential variable modifications, and carbamidomethyl (C), iTRAQ8plex (N-term), iTRAQ8plex (K) were the fixed modifications. The charge states of peptides were set to +2 and +3. Specifically, an automatic decoy database search was performed in Mascot by choosing the decoy checkbox in which a random sequence of database is generated and tested for raw spectra as well as the real database. To reduce the probability of false peptide identification, only peptides at a 95% confidence interval (P < 0.05) with a false discovery rate (FDR) estimation ≤1.04% were counted as being successfully identified. Each confident protein identification involved at least one unique peptide. For protein quantitation, it was required that a protein contains at least two unique spectra.

The decidual immune system plays a critical role in regulating the immune micro-environment and in the induction of immune tolerance. To better understand the factors that mediate the decidual immune response associated with the T. gondii infection, a large-scale study employing TMT proteomics was conducted to characterize the differential decidual immune proteomes from infected and uninfected human decidual immune cells samples. The decidual immune cells from 105 human voluntary abortion tissues were purified, and of the 5510 unique proteins identified, 181 proteins were found to be differentially abundant (>1.2-fold cutoff, P＜0.05) in the T. gondii-infected decidual immune cells. 11 proteins of 181 differentially expressed proteins associated with trophoblast invasion, placental development, intrauterine fetal growth, and immune tolerance were verified using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting.

DJ-1, a protein involved in oxidative stress sensing, gained major attention when mutations in its gene were identified in PD patients. Although the study of the corresponding protein function is still in its infancy, a crucial oxidation sensor at a conserved cysteine was linked to the disease. Inspired by inhibition studies with a bacterial homolog of DJ-1 we here screen several amino-epoxycylcohexenones and identify a chemical probe that exhibits specificity for the human protein in various cell lines. The probe selectively labeled the oxidation sensor via nucleophilic attack of the conserved cysteine onto the epoxide ring. This covalent addition occurred only in the reduced state. Whole proteome studies in HeLa, A549 and SHSY5Y cell lines confirmed strong enrichment of solely reduced DJ-1 which was diminished by increasing oxidative stress. The probe thus facilitates the first selective in situ monitoring of DJ-1 in its reduced state and enables studying the function of this important biomarker in dependence of oxidative stress.

It has approached 4000-8000 protein identifications (IDs) from a human cell line, mouse brains or Xenopus embryos via coupling with liquid chromatography (LC) prefractionation. However, at least five hundred micrograms of complex proteome digests were required for the LC-CZE-MS/MS studies. This requirement of a large amount of initial peptide material impedes the application of CZE-MS/MS for deep bottom-up proteomics of mass-limited samples. In this work, we coupled micro-scale reversed-phase LC (µRPLC) based peptide prefractionation to dynamic pH junction based CZE-MS/MS for deep bottom-up proteomics of the MCF7 breast cancer cell proteome starting with only 5-µg peptides. The dynamic pH junction based CZE enabled a 500-nL sample injection from as low as a 1.5-µL peptide sample, using up to 33% of the available peptide material for an analysis. Two kinds of µRPLC prefractionation were investigated, C18 ZipTip and nanoflow RPLC. C18 ZipTip-CZE-MS/MS identified 4453 proteins from 5 µg of the MCF7 proteome digest and showed good qualitative and quantitative reproducibility. Nanoflow RPLC-CZE-MS/MS produced over 7500 protein IDs and nearly 60000 peptide IDs from the 5-µg MCF7 proteome digest. The nanoflow RPLC-CZE-MS/MS platform reduced the required amount of complex proteome digests for LC-CZE-MS/MS-based deep bottom-up proteomics by two orders of magnitude.

Antigen-specific immunotherapy holds promise to strengthen immune control in CML, but requires the identification of CML-associated targets. In this study, we used a mass spectrometry-based approach to identify naturally presented HLA class I- and class II-presented peptides in 20 primary CML samples. Comparative HLA ligandome profiling using a comprehensive dataset of different hematological benign specimen delineated a novel panel of frequently expressed CML-exclusive peptides. These non-mutated target antigens are of particular relevance since our extensive data-mining approach demonstrated absence of naturally presented BCR-ABL- and ABL-BCR-derived HLA-presented peptides and the lack of frequent tumor-exclusive presentation of predescribed cancer/testis and leukemia-associated antigens. Functional characterization revealed spontaneous T-cell responses against the newly identified CML-associated peptides in CML patients and their ability to de novo induce multifunctional and cytotoxic antigen-specific T cells in healthy volunteers and CML patients. This characterizes these antigens as prime candidates for T cell-based immunotherapy approaches that may prolong TKI-free survival and even mediate cure of CML patients.

To our best knowledge, the study is one of the largest quantitative proteomic study of human breast tissues, including the analysis of 118 tissue samples from 65 patients with long-term survival outcomes. Our data show that protein expression describes a tumor biology that is only partly captured by the transcriptome, with mRNA abundance incompletely predicting protein abundance in tumors, and even less so in non-cancerous tissue. Furthermore, the tumor proteome described disease pathways and subgroups that were only partially captured by the tumor transcriptome.

In the current study, we performed comparative quantitative proteomics on whole plasma sampled from patients with stable angina (NMI), acute myocardial infarction (MI), and healthy control subjects without angina (Ctrl). We detected a total of 371 proteins with high confidence (FDR < 1%, p < 0.05), including 53 candidate biomarkers that displayed ≥ 2-fold modulated expression in patients with cardiovascular diseases (27 associated with atherosclerotic stable angina, 26 with myocardial injury). In the verification phase, we used label-free LC-MRM-MS-based targeted proteomic method to quantify and to verify the candidate biomarkers in pooled plasma, excluded peptides that were poorly distinguished from background, and then performed further validation of the remaining candidates in 49 individual plasma samples. Using this approach, we identified a final panel of 8 proteins that were both reliably and significantly modulated in disease (p < 0.05), including novel biomarkers of atherosclerotic stable angina that have been implicated in endothelial dysfunction (F10 and MST1), and previously unknown biomarkers of myocardial injury reportedly involved in either plaque destabilization (SERPINA3, CPN2, LUM) or tissue protection/repair mechanisms (ORM2, ACTG1, NAGLU). Taken together, our data showed that prognostic markers can be successfully detected in non-depleted human plasma using an iTRAQ/MRM-based discovery-validation approach, and also demonstrate that a novel panel 8 biomarkers can discriminate between the complex pathophysiologies of atherosclerotic stable angina and myocardial injury.

Data were normalized by bias correction and background correction to eliminate variations due to loading error or co-elution of non-target peptides. Search results were exported into Microsoft Excel for further comparison of replicate runs. A 2-fold change cutoff was set such that up-regulated proteins were identified by expression ratios ≥2 and downregulated proteins by ratios ≤0.5. The false discovery rate (FDR) for each search was generated by ProteinPilot™ and the numbers of proteins reported in this study were based on global protein FDR<1%. Differentially expressed proteins were extracted for further analyses.  MRM data analysis All MRM raw data files generated by the TSQ Vantage were processed using Pinpoint™ V1.3, which automatically detected the integrated peak areas of all targeted transitions and aligned these for data visualization, as well as performing relative quantification at the levels of transition, peptide and protein. Global normalization of the peak intensities from the triplicate measurements were also computed by the software. The extracted ion chromatogram of all transitions for each targeted peptide were examined manually to confirm accurate peak integration. The peptide ion peak areas of all transitions were then used to determine the relative abundance of the corresponding proteins.   Bioinformatic analyses and data annotation The open access tool FunRich V2.1.2 (25) was used for gene ontology (GO) annotation and analyses of functional enrichment and network interactions. Scatter dot plots were generated and statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism V6.0 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). The proteolytic peptide sequences selected for MRM analyses were submitted to NCBI BLASTP (26, 27) for searching using default settings against non-redundant protein sequences (nr).

Recent studies have shown altered proteomic profiles in various conditions of PD patients, including uremia, diabetes, peritonitis, abnormal peritoneal transport function and with different peritoneal dialysis modality. However, these studies extracted proteins in PDE by precipitation techniques resulting in high abundant diffusible proteins from blood circulation which interfered with the identification of low abundant, locally secreted, yet important, biomarkers. we hypothesize that EVs are secreted from peritoneal resident cells and contain known biomarkers for PDE-related membrane injury. As a proof of concept, here we identified and characterized EVs from PDE of healthy PD patients using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Furthermore, we did proteomics and bioinformatics analyses to determine the number and type of proteins measurable within EVs isolated from the PDE using two methods of vesicle isolation. 	"[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]"		"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""}]"	"[""Q Exactive""]"	"[""Biomedical"",""Human Proteome Project""]"	"[""Gel-based experiment""]"		Proteomics, extracellular vesicles,  Peritoneal Dialysis	Peptides were separated by nano-liquid chromatography (EASY-nLC 1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap, Thermo Fisher Scientific) through an EASY-Spray nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Approximately 600,000 CHB patients each year die of HBV-related diseases such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Therefore, CHB remains a global health concern. Although there have been anti-HBV agents for treating CHB, they have some limitations including viral-drug resistance and adverse effects. Type III IFN or IFN-λ is promising to use as anti-HBV agents because of its anti-viral activities like type I IFNs. In addition, the expression of its receptor, IFNLR1, is limited only in epithelial cells including hepatocytes. Thus, treatment with IFN-lambda results in less side effects compared to IFN-alpha treatment. IFN-lambdas have been shown to inhibit the replication of several viruses including IAV, DENV, EMCV, HIV, HCV, and HBV; however, there have been no studies on the effects of IFN-λ3, the highest activity among other subtypes, on HBV replication. Therefore, this study aims to determine antiviral activities of IFN-λ3 against HBV replication and to investigate its molecular mechanism responsible for suppressing HBV propagation. The results showed that HBV transcripts and amount of intracellular HBV DNA were decreased in HepG2.2.15 cells, stable HBV-transfected hepatoblastoma cell line, treated with IFN-λ3 in a dose-dependent manner. This indicated that IFN-λ3 could inhibit HBV replication. Next, we performed quantitative proteomics to investigate the proteome changes in HepG2.2.15 treated with IFN-λ3. The proteins that changed their expressions were involved in several biological processes such as defense to viral infection, immune responses, cell-cell adhesion, transcription, translation, and metabolism. We further confirmed the proteomics results by immunoblotting assay. Consistent with MS data, it found that the expression of OAS3, SAMHD1 and STAT1 were increased as a result of IFN-λ3 stimulation. These results indicated that proteomics results were reproducible and reliable. Finally, we proposed 3 possible mechanisms involved in suppressing HBV replication including i.) IFN-λ3 induced anti-viral proteins affecting many steps in HBV life cycle ii.) IFN-λ3 promoted antigen processing and antigen presentation and iii.) IFN-λ3 rescued RIG-I signaling to promote both type I and type III IFN production.

The peptide repertoire is extended by various post-translational modifications, including cis-splicing of peptides from the same protein. Here, we have applied a novel bioinformatic workflow and demonstrate that spliced-peptides are also generated through trans-splicing (fusion of peptide segments from distinct antigens) and their abundance challenges current models of proteasomal-splicing that predict cis-splicing as the most probable outcome. These trans-spliced peptides display canonical HLA binding motif sequence features. These results highlight the unanticipated diversity of the immunopeptidome and have important implications for autoimmunity, vaccine design and immunotherapy.

To date, the organization and pathway of assembly of these chromatin regulators remain unknown, presenting a major barrier to structural and functional determination. Here we elucidate the architecture and assembly pathway of three different classes of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes: canonical BAF, PBAF, and a newly defined complex, ncBAF, and define the requirement of each subunit for complex formation and stability. Using affinity purification of endogenous complexes from mammalian and Drosophila cells coupled with cross linking-mass spectrometry, we uncover three distinct and evolutionarily conserved modules, their organization, and the temporal incorporation of these modules into each complete mSWI/SNF complex class.

Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are frequent in TNBC and have been shown to correlate with outcome, suggesting an immunogenic component in this subtype. However, other factors, intrinsic to the cancer cells, may also influence outcome. To identify proteins and molecular pathways associated with recurrence in TNBC, 34 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary TNBC tumors were investigated by global proteomic profiling using TMT-HILIC-LC-MS/MS. Approximately half of the patients were lymph node-negative and remained free of local or distant metastasis within 10 years follow-up, while the other half developed distant metastasis. Proteomic profiling identified >4000 proteins, of which 63 exhibited altered expression in primary tumors of recurrence versus recurrence-free patients. Importantly, down-regulation of proteins in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation pathways were enriched, including TAP1, TAP2, CALR, HLA-A, ERAP1 and TAPBP, and were associated with significantly shorter recurrence-free and overall survival. In addition, proteins involved in cancer cell proliferation and growth, including GBP1, RAD23B, WARS and STAT1, also exhibited altered expression in primary tumors of recurrence versus recurrence-free patients. The association between the antigen-presentation pathway and outcome were validated in a second sample set of 10 primary TNBC tumors and corresponding metastases using proteomics and in a large public gene expression database of 249 TNBC and 580 basal-like breast cancer cases. Our study demonstrates that down-regulation of antigen presentation is a key mechanism for TNBC cells to avoid immune surveillance, allowing continued growth and spread.

The Sequest and Mascot search algorithms (v. 2.2.3), both integrated with Proteome Discoverer, were used to search the data with the following criteria: SwissProt protein database (downloaded 5th October 2012, 452768 entries) and restricted to humans. Fixed search parameters included trypsin, two missed cleavages allowed, and TMT labeling at lysine and N-terminal amines, while methionine oxidation and deamidation were set as dynamic. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 8 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.05 Da. Peptide data were extracted using Mascot significance threshold 0.05 and minimum peptide length 6. A minimum of 2 peptides were used for protein identification, and a minimum of 2 unique peptides were used for protein quantitation. False discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using a decoy database search and only high confidence peptide identifications (FDR < 1 %) were included. Protein expression data was log2 transformed and quantile normalized. Fold changes between recurrence and recurrence-free patients were determined by taking the difference (x = recurrence/recurrence-free) and raising this to the power of two (2x).  We used a previously established Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter analysis platform68 to analyze significant (p < 0.05) proteins from the MS data in published gene expression datasets. The online tool (http://www.kmplotter.com/breast) contains 4142 breast cancer patients curated from 26 GEO gene expression datasets, of which 3557 have recurrence-free survival data (RFS). Of the 3557 breast cancer patients, 249 are confirmed TNBC patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Each percentile between the lower and upper quartiles was computed for each analyzed gene expression and the best performing threshold was used as cutoff in the Cox regression analysis.69 KMplotter then generated survival plots with hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals and log rank P value for each selected gene probe (the best JetSet gene probe was always selected). Basal-like breast cancer patients in the database were identified by low expression of ER and HER2 using Affymetrix HGU133A or HGU133plus2 arrays with cutoff values of 500 and 4800 respectively.  RNA from frozen TNBC patient tumors was isolated using TRIzol® followed by reverse transcription to cDNA using random hexamer oligonucleotide primers (Thermo Scientific). Relative quantification of TAP1 gene expression was performed in duplicate using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen; Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus) and primers: TAP1: QT00057288, PUM1: QT00029421, ACTB: QT0009531 (Qiagen). The relative median expression was normalized using PUM1 and ACTB as reference genes. Expression was shown as fold change relative to a random recurrence-free patient.  RStudio 3.2.0 and GraphPad Prism 5.01 were used for statistical analysis. All p-value calculations were two-sided and homoscedastic and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Network analysis was performed in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity, Qiagen). Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) curves were generated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis in GraphPad Prism 5. Hazard ratio (HR) and p-values were calculated via log-rank tests.

Several mechanisms regulate eNOS activity and function, including phosphorylation at Ser and Thr residues and protein-protein interactions. Combining a tandem affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry, we identified stromal cell-derived factor 2 (SDF2) as a component of the eNOS macromolecular complex in endothelial cells. SDF2 knockdown impaired agonist stimulated NO synthesis and decreased phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177, a key event required for maximal activation of eNOS. Conversely, SDF2 overexpression dose-dependently increased NO synthesis through a mechanism involving Akt and calcium (induced with ionomycin), which increased the phosphorylation of Ser1177 in eNOS. NO synthesis by iNOS (inducible NOS) and nNOS (neuronal NOS) was also enhanced upon SDF2 overexpression. We found that SDF2 was a client protein of the chaperone protein Hsp90, interacting preferentially with the M domain of Hsp90, which is the same domain that binds to eNOS. In endothelial cells exposed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), SDF2 was required for the binding of Hsp90 and calmodulin to eNOS, resulting in eNOS phosphorylation and activation. Thus, our data describe a function for SDF2 as a component of the Hsp90-eNOS complex that is critical for signal transduction in endothelial cells.

Here we present a rapid method for antibody validation based on denaturing gel electrophoresis of biotinylated cell lysates (PAGE) followed by mass spectrometry (MS) and antibody array analysis (MAP). The first step, PAGE, produces 12 fractions containing proteins of increasing molecular weight. The fractions are analyzed in parallel by MS and MAP. Antibodies to be tested are immobilized on color coded polymer beads to create antibody arrays, which can comprise up to several thousand various antibodies. MS data provide definite protein identifications in each fraction, creating a reference for antibody reactivity patterns obtained via MAP. The method employs automated software to compare both datasets and provide validation data for each antibody tested. Due to the high-throughput nature of the assay we were able to screen several thousands of antibodies against six different cell lines. The differences in protein expression between the cell lines provide an additional control of antibody specificity. Using PAGE-MAP it is possible to screen and validate thousands of antibodies in a matter of weeks. Moreover, antibodies are tested under standardized conditions, which allows for direct comparison of their performance.

To discover drivers of long-term survival, we quantitatively analyzed the proteomes of platinum resistant and sensitive HGSOC patients from minute amounts of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. This revealed cancer/testis antigen 45 (CT45) as an independent prognostic factor associated with a doubling of disease-free survival in advanced stage HGSOC. Phospho- and interaction proteomics tied CT45 to DNA damage pathways through direct interaction with the PP4 phosphatase complex. In vitro, CT45 regulated PP4 activity and its high expression led to increased DNA damage and platinum sensitivity. CT45-derived HLA class I peptides, identified by immunopeptidomics, activate patient-derived cytotoxic T cells and promote tumor cell killing. This study highlights the power of clinical cancer proteomics to identify targets for chemo- and immunotherapy and illuminate their biological roles.

A POR has been found to be related to several factors, including advanced age, high body mass index, and history of ovarian or pelvic surgery. However, it is difficult to predict POR, as there are no specific biomarkers known. In this study, we used quantitative proteomic analyses to investigate potential biomarkers that can predict poor response during IVF based on follicular fluid samples. A total of 1,079 proteins were identified using a high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled online to a nano flow liquid chromatography system. It is notable that 65 up-regulated and 66 down-regulated proteins were found to be functionally enriched in poor responders. We also validated these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) using a triple-quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometer for quantification of targeted proteins. Of the DEPs, three proteins (pregnancy zone protein, renin, and sushi repeat-containing protein SRPX) were regarded as statistically significant (p < 0.05). These proteins (one known as an inhibitor of cell growth and another as a regulator of angiogenesis) are potential biomarkers candidates of POR in IVF.

Plasma and serum are rich sources of information about an individual’s health state and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics now allows highly specific and quantitative read-out of the plasma proteome. Here we employ plasma proteome profiling to define marker panels assessing the quality of plasma and serum samples and the likelihood that suggested biomarkers are instead artifacts related to sample handling and processing. We acquired reference proteomes of erythrocytes, platelets, plasma and whole blood of 20 individuals (>6000 proteins), and compared serum and plasma proteomes. Based on spike-in experiments we defined a panels of contamination-associated proteins, many of which have been reported as biomarker candidates. We provide sample preparation guidelines and an online resource (www.plasmaproteomeprofiling.com) to assess overall sample-related bias in clinical studies and to prevent costly miss-assignment of biomarker candidates.

We set the false discovery rate (FDR) to 0.01 for protein and peptide level with a minimum length of 7 amino acids for peptides and the FDR was determined by searching a reverse database. Enzyme specificity was set as C-terminal to arginine and lysine as expected using trypsin and Lys-C as proteases. A maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed. Peptide identification was performed with an initial precursor mass deviation up to 7 ppm and a fragment mass deviation of 20 ppm. The ‘match between run algorithm’ in the MaxQuant quantification (Nagaraj et al., 2012) was performed after constructing a matching library consistent of depleted and all the undepleted plasma samples from the weight loss study.

Materials and Methods: We employed liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cSCC material to study the tumor and normal skin tissue proteomes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to interpret the role of altered proteins in cSCC pathophysiology. Results were validated using the Human Protein Atlas and Oncomine database in silico. Results: Of 1,310 unique proteins identified, expression of an average of 144 and 88 proteins were significantly (p<0.05) increased and decreased, respectively, in the tumor samples compared to their normal counterparts. IPA analysis revealed disruptions in proteins associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. In silico analysis confirmed that proteins corresponding to 12 antibodies, and genes corresponding to 18 proteins were differentially expressed between the two categories, validating our proteomic measurements. Conclusion: Label-free MS-based proteomics is useful for analyzing FFPE cSCC tissues.

Peptide mixtures (10 μg) were prepared in 20 μl of 1% formic acid (FA) and 0.05% heptafluorobutyric acid for RP-LC-MS/MS analysis. Samples were separated by a nanoflow Ultimate 3000 HPLC and autosampler system (Dionex Corp, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) coupled online to a Q-Exactive™ Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a nanospray ionization ion source. Peptides (2 μg) were loaded in triplicate at a flow rate of 200 nl/min onto a C18-reversed phase column with mobile phase buffers A (2% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% FA) and B (80% ACN/0.1% FA), over a 2- h linear gradient (2-45% B for 118 min; 45-80% B for 1 min, 80% B for 1 min). Duplicate blank runs (30 min, 2-80% buffer B) were performed between each sample type, with 10 min washes with 2% buffer B prior to each sample. Data acquisition was achieved in a positive polarity mode using a data-dependent top-10 method where the most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (350-1,750 m/z) were dynamically chosen for higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 while for HCD spectra this was set to 17,500. In order to increase the likely coverage of lower abundant precursor ions, a 30 s dynamic exclusion list was employed. Automatic gain control was used to ensure that the Orbitrap mass analyzer always filled with the optimum number of ions, i.e. 1×106, for generation of MS/MS spectra. Normalized collision energy was set to 30 eV to achieve optimum fragmentation efficiency, and the intensity threshold, which defines the minimum precursor intensity to trigger an MS2 scan, was set to 5×104. A list of around 500 ion masses corresponding to the most common and prominent peptide contaminants were added as an exclusion list. PeptideMass function of the ExPASy (http://web.expasy.org/peptide_mass) was used to calculate theoretical monoisotopic ion masses of potentially important proteins such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, 2 and 5 (ERK1/2/5), serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (B-RAF), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-RAS) and P53, the generated ion masses of which were added to an inclusion list in the MS method.	2018-10-29	"[[""DOI:null"",""PMID:27807068""]]"

In HeLa cells, GA inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis, as showed by results of MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis. Possible target-related proteins of GA were searched using comparative proteomic analysis (2-DE) and 9 proteins at early (3 h) stage together with 9 proteins at late (24 h) stage were found. Vimentin was the only target-related protein found at both early and late stage. Results of both 2-DE analysis and Western blotting assay suggested cleavage of vimentin induced by GA. MS/MS analysis of cleaved vimentin peptides indicated possible cleavage sites of vimentin at or near aa51 and aa425. Results of targeted proteomic analysis showed that GA induced change in phosphorylation state of the vimentin head domain (aa51-64). Caspase inhibitors could not abrogate GA-induced cleavage of vimentin. Over-expression of vimentin ameliorated cytotoxicity of GA in HeLa cells. The GA-activated signal transduction, from p38 MAPK, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), vimentin, dysfunction of cytoskeleton, to cell death, was predicted and then confirmed. Results of animal study showed that GA treatment inhibited tumor growth in HeLa tumor-bearing mice and cleavage of vimentin could be observed in tumor xenografts of GA-treated animals. Results of immunohistochemical staining also showed down-regulated vimentin level in tumor xenografts of GA-treated animals. Furthermore, compared with cytotoxicity of GA in HeLa cells, cytotoxicity of GA in MCF-7 cells with low level of vimentin was weaker while cytotoxicity of GA in MG-63 cells with high level of vimentin was stronger. These results indicated the important role of vimentin in the cytotoxicity of GA. The effects of GA on vimentin and other epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers provided suggestion for better usage of GA in clinic.

It has been recently demonstrated that the formation and accumulation of RNA fragments (RFs) is cell-/tissue-specific and depends on internal and external stimuli. Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying RF biogenesis and function remain unclear. To better understand them, we employed RNA pull-down and mass spectrometry methods to characterize the interaction networks of seven RFs originating from tRNA, snoRNA and snRNA. In addition, we performed an in silico screen of the selected RFs against publicly available cross-linking and immunoprecipitation datasets. We determined that the RF interactome comprises a large number of proteins, which were generally different from those that interact with their parental full length RNAs. Proteins that were differentially bound by the RFs were involved in mRNA splicing, tRNA processing, DNA recombination/replication, protein biosynthesis and carbocyclic acid metabolism. Our data suggest that RFs can be endogenous aptamer-like molecules and potential players in emerging RNA-protein regulatory networks.

We developed a SWATH-MS workflow with a curated spectral library of 1,073 targets. Application of the workflow across nine replicates of three sample types (EVs, microvesicles (MVs) and urine proteins (UP)) resulting in the quantitation of 842 proteins. The median-coefficient of variation of the 842 proteins in the EV sample was 7.6%, indicating excellent reproducibility. Data analysis showed common EV markers, (i.e. CD9, CD63, ALIX, TSG101 and HSP70) were enriched in urinary EVs as compared to MV and UP samples.

Merge search of 16 DDA files were accomplished by Protein Pilot v.5.0, revision 4769 (Sciex) using Paragon algorithm against SwissProt Homo Sapiens database (v.113016, 20,200 entries) with an automated false discovery rate and the searching parameters as followed; alkylation on cysteine by iodoacetamide, tryptic digestion, TripleTOF 5600 instrument, gel-based ID special factors, ID focus on biological modification, thorough ID search effort, and detected protein threshold [unused ProtScore (Conf)] > 0.05 (10%). The search result was manually inspected for unique peptides and proteins with false discovery rate (FDR) <1% which were considered valid. The Protein Pilot search result (*.group) was loaded onto SWATH Acquisition MicroApp v.2.0.2133 in PeakView software v.2.2 (Sciex). The maximum number of protein to import for spectral library generation was set as the number of proteins identified at 1% global FDR from fit. The original spectral library file (*.txt) was then imported into an Excel worksheet for manual curation. To reduce the source of assay inconsistency and variability, the spectral library was manually curated to exclude; i) any peptide with modification, but except carboxamidomethyl (CAM) of cysteine; ii) any peptide with missed cleavage; iii) any peptide that not terminated by lysine or arginine (which considered as non-tryptic peptide); iv) any peptide that identified as contamination or reversed sequences. The curated spectral library was imported back for further processing in SWATH Acquisition MicroApp in PeakView software. Since albumin and Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) almost always presented in protein samples prepared from human urine, combination of albumin and THP peptides with various RT covered chromatographic separation was applied as the internal peptide standards for calibration. Retention time (RT) alignment was then be performed to calibrate RT of each peptide in different sample sets by the endogenous peptide strategy. The curated spectral library was used for SWATH data extraction.  SWATH-MS analysis For SWATH-MS analysis, peptide samples corresponding to 2.5 μg proteins obtained from EV, MV and UP samples (3 replicates for each sample) were submitted into NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS operated in DIA mode to obtain digital protein records (DIA files in *.wiff). SWATH data extraction was performed by SWATH Acquisition MicroApp (Sciex) using an extraction window of 5 min and the following parameters: 10 peptides per protein, 6 transitions per peptide, excluding shared peptides, peptide confidence of >99% with FDR<1%, and XIC width of 0.05 Da.   Data preprocessing and statistical analysis  After data extraction, quantitative data of all valid peptides and proteins were exported to the Excel worksheet. Data preprocessing was performed by Total Area Sum (TAS) approach using the following equation; [TAS-normalized protein intensity = (raw SWATH intensity of a particular protein/total intensity of all measured proteins) x 1.0E+08].

The objective of this research is to observe change of protein profile induced by Ranibizumab (an anti-VEGF agent) in vitreous humor from PDR patients and reveal the effects of anti-VEGF treatment on PDR. Methods: A proteomic method was used to identify differentially expressed proteins in vitreous humor. Untreated PDR patients were defined as PDR group, while those who treated with intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (IVR) were defined as IVR. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and REACTOME pathways were obtained from DAVID Bioinformatics Resources. Intravitreal level of apolipoprotein C-I (APOC1), serpin peptidase inhibitor clade A member 5 (SERPINA5), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP2), and keratin 1 (KRT1) were determined by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). Results: 339 differentially expressed proteins were identified in response to IVR. The most notable GO annotation describes the altered proteins was “innate immune response”. The most notable REACTOME pathway was “platelet degranulation”. ELISA result showed increased level of APOC1, SERPINA5, KRT1 and a decreased level of TIMP2 in PDR group compared with IVR. Conclusions: In addition to decreasing VEGF level, Ranibizumab is associated with change of human vitreous protein profile in patients with PDR, in which the differential proteins are involved in immune response, platelet degranulation, complement activation etc., suggesting that the effects of VEGF are involved in these signaling pathways.

966	PXD009915	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD009915	Evidence for the nuclear import of monomeric histones H3.1 & H4	We present here evidence that histones H3.1 and H4 can be imported into the nucleus as monomers in human cells. Using a tether-and-release system to study the cytosolic phase and import dynamics of newly synthesised histones, we find that H3.1 and H4 can be maintained as stable monomers in the cytosol in a tethered state. Cytosolically tethered histones are bound tightly to Importin- proteins (predominantly IPO4), but not to the histone specific chaperones NASP, ASF1a, RbAp46 (RBBP7) or HAT1, which reside in the nucleus in interphase cells. Release of monomeric histones from their cytosolic tether results in rapid nuclear translocation, dissociation with IPO4 and incorporation into chromatin at sites of replication. Quantitative analysis of histones bound to individual chaperones under steady-state conditions reveals an excess of H3 specifically associated with sNASP, suggesting that NASP can maintain a soluble, monomeric pool of H3 within the nucleus and may act as a nuclear receptor for newly imported histone. In summary, we propose that histones H3 and H4 are rapidly imported as monomeric units, forming heterodimers in the nucleus rather than the cytosol, with sNASP acting as a potential nuclear receptor for monomeric histone H3.

The liquid Pap test fixative is an unexplored resource for analysis of microbial communities and the microbe-host interaction. Previously, we showed that the residual cell-free fixative from discarded Pap tests of healthy women could be used for mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomic identification of cervical-vaginal proteins.  In this study, we reprocessed these MS raw data files for metaproteomic analysis to characterize the microbial community composition and function of microbial proteins in the cervical-vaginal region. This was accomplished by developing a customized protein sequence database encompassing microbes likely present in the vagina. High-mass accuracy data were searched against the protein FASTA database using a two-step search method within the Galaxy for proteomics platform.  Data was analyzed by MEGAN6 (MetaGenomeAnalyzer) for phylogenetic and functional characterization.  We identified over 300 unique peptides from a variety of bacterial phyla and Candida.  Peptides corresponding to proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, oxidation-reduction, and transport were identified.  By identifying microbial peptides in Pap test supernatants it may be possible to acquire a functional signature of these microbes, as well as detect specific proteins associated with cervical health and disease.

The database of microbial species of the urogenital tract [331,242 sequences from 130 bacterial proteomes plus Candida was generated from Human Microbiome Project reference genomes using an in-house program, MicPrDB (https://github.com/somiafiuni/MicPrDB) and merged with a “target” version of the Human Uniprot database and contaminant sequences, and 3-frame translated cDNA protein sequences [2,674,981 sequences in the 3-frame translated cDNA (EnSEMBL) database plus the target version of  the human Uniprot database with contaminant sequences (November 2014)]. The database search was performed with ProteinPilot™ within the Galaxy for proteomics (Galaxy-P) platform. Accession numbers associated with all microbial peptide identifications from the first search were merged with the human database plus contaminants to create a “target-decoy” database used for the calculation of the false discovery rate (FDR).  This refined target-decoy database of human plus bacterial proteins and translated 3-frame cDNA sequences was used to search high mass accuracy peak lists to identify distinct peptide sequences from spectra at 5% local FDR.  High confidence peptide matches were analyzed by using the downstream metagenomic/metaproteomic analysis tool MEGAN6 to parse BLASTP searches of peptide spectra. The BLASTP settings were as described in Jagtap et al., 2015 and Rudney et al., 2015.Briefly, all instances of the spectrum for a given peptide (PSMs) were retained, to allow for spectral counting. The PSMs list was split into a list of short sequences (≤30 amino acids), and a list of long sequences (>30 amino acids) and searched against the BLAST-NR database, using BLASTP parameters described below. For short peptide sequences, the following parameters were used - set expectation value cutoff: 200 000; scoring matrix: PAM30; gap costs: Existence 9, Extension 1; word size for wordfinder algorithm: 2; multiple hits window size: 15; threshold: minimum score to add a word to the BLAST lookup table: 16; and use composition-based statistics: 0 or F. Longer peptides were subjected to following BLASTP parameters: set expectation value cutoff: 10; scoring matrix: BLOSUM62; gap costs: existence 11, extension 1; word size for wordfinder algorithm: 3; multiple hits windowsize: 40; threshold: minimum score to add a word to the BLAST lookup table: 11; use composition-based statistics: 2,T or D.  MEGAN6 uses the Lowest Common Ancestor algorithm (LCA) to assign reads to taxa. It allows functional analyses using several different ontological systems. The greatest number of hits was obtained with InterPro2GO for functional classification to Gene Ontology categories and IPR protein families, and those results are reported here. The MEGAN6 parameters used were: minScore = 25.0, maxExpected = 10.0, top Percent = 10.0, min Support = 1, weighted LCA Percent = 80.0.	2018-04-25	"[[""PMID:30022083"",""DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-29092-4""]]"

Recent evidence indicates that apart from conserved molecular allostery, Hsp70 proteins retained and adapted throughout the evolution the ability to assemble as functionally relevant ATP-bound dimers. Here we have compared the ATP-dependent dimerization of DnaK, human stress-inducible Hsp70, Hsc70 and BiP Hsp70 proteins showing that their dimerization propensities differ with stress-inducible Hsp70 being predominantly dimeric in the presence of ATP. The structural analyses using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, chemical cross-linking and small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that stress-inducible Hsp70 assembles in solution as an antiparallel dimer with the intermolecular interface closely resembling the ATP-bound dimer interfaces captured in DnaK and BiP crystal structures. ATP-dependent dimerization of stress-inducible Hsp70 is necessary for its efficient interaction with Hsp40 as shown by experiments with dimerization-deficient mutants. Moreover, dimerization of ATP-bound Hsp70 is required for its participation in high molecular weight protein complexes detected ex vivo supporting its functional role in vivo. As human cytosolic Hsp70 has the ability to interact with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain containing co-chaperones, we tested the interaction of Hsp70 ATP-dependent dimer with Chip and Tomm34 co-chaperones. While Chip associates with intact Hsp70 dimer to form a larger complex, binding of Tomm34 disrupts Hsp70 dimer and this event plays an important role in Hsp70 activity regulation. In summary, this study provides structural evidence of robust ATP-dependent antiparallel dimerization of human inducible Hsp70 protein and suggests novel role of TPR domain co-chaperones in multichaperone complexes involving Hsp70 ATP-bound dimers.

Design: We used primary human OA chondrocytes and adipose stem cells (ASCs) in mono- and cocultures and performed a high throughput secretome analysis. Among secreted proteins differentially induced in cocultures, we identified thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) as a potential candidate that could be involved in the chondroprotective effect of ASCs. Results: Secretome analysis revealed significant induction of THBS1in ASCs/chondrocytes cocultures at the mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, we showed that THBS1 was up-regulated at late stages of MSC chondrogenic differentiation while recombinant THBS1 exerted a prochondrogenic effect on MSC. However, down-regulation of THBS1 in ASCs did not revert OA chondrocyte phenotype by decreasing hypertrophic and inflammatory markers.  Nevertheless, down-regulation of THBS1 in ASCs reduced their immunosuppressive activity while recombinant THBS1 exerted an anti-inflammatory role on T lymphocytes. THBS1 function was evaluated in vivo in the collagenase-induced OA (CIOA) model by comparing ASCs expressing siTHBS1 and control ASCs. The OA protective effect of ASCs was reversed when THBS1 was down-regulated in ASCs indicating that THBS1 plays a role in the therapeutic effect of ASCs Conclusions: Our data gather some evidence that THBS1 exerts a pro-chondrogenic and anti-inflammatory function in vitro, which could partially explain a chondroprotective effect of ASCs in OA.

Integrin alpha3 deficiency leads to interstitial lung disease, nephrotic syndrome and epidermolysis bullosa (ILNEB), an autosomal recessive multiorgan disease characterized by basement membrane abnormalities in skin, lung and kidney. The pathogenetic chains from ITGA3 mutation to tissue abnormalities are still unclear. Although integrin 3 was reported to regulate multiple extracellular proteins, the composition of the extracellular compartment of integrin alpha3-negative keratinocytes has not been resolved so far. In a comprehensive approach, quantitative proteomics of deposited extracellular matrix, conditioned cultured media as well as of the intracellular compartment of keratinocytes isolated from an ILNEB patient and from normal skin were performed. By mass spectrometry-based proteomics, 167 proteins corresponding to the GO terms “extracellular” and “cell adhesion”, or included in the “human matrisome” were identified in the deposited extracellular matrix, and 217 in the conditioned media of normal human keratinocytes. In the absence of integrin alpha3, 33% and 26% respectively were dysregulated. Dysregulated proteins were functionally related to integrin alpha3 or were known interaction partners. The results show that in the absence of integrin alpha3 ILNEB keratinocytes produce a fibronectin-rich microenvironment and make use of fibronectin-binding integrin subunits alphav and alpha5.

The specific role of β-catenin in the anucleate platelet however remains elusive.  Here, we performed a label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of β-catenin immunoprecipitates from human platelets identifying 9 co-immunoprecipitating proteins. GO biological pathway analysis revealed a significant enrichment of specific functional terms including 'cell adhesion', 'cell junction organization' and ‘adherens junction organization'. Our bioinformatics data suggests that human platelet β-catenin may be involved in facilitating cell adhesion and cell junctions. We found three proteins co-immunoprecipitating with β-catenin under both resting and activated conditions, four proteins under resting condition only and two proteins under activated condition only.

An FDR of 0.01 (1%) was used at the peptide and protein level and was estimated by searching a reversed and forward database. To generate the LFQ intensity protein profiles, signals of corresponding peptides in different HP LC MS/MS runs were matched by MaxQuant applying a mass accuracy of at least 20 ppm and a maximum retention time window of 2 min (Luber, Cox et al. 2010). Protein profiles were based on the ion intensities of all peptides assigned to a given protein in each of the fractions analysed.

Multiple databases have been dedicated to PTMs, including recent initiatives oriented to the in silico prediction of PTM interactions. The study of PTM cross-talk ultimately requires experimental evidence about whether certain PTMs co-exist in a single protein molecule. However, available resources do not assist researchers in the experimental detection of co-modified peptides. Here we present TCellXTalk, a comprehensive database of phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation sites in human T cells that supports the experimental detection of co-modified peptides using targeted or directed mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of TCellXTalk and the strategy presented here in a proof of concept experiment that enabled the identification and quantification of 15 co-modified (phosphorylated and ubiquitinated) peptides in CD3 proteins of the T-cell receptor complex. To our knowledge, these are the first co-modified peptide sequences described in this widely studied cell type. Furthermore, quantitative data showed distinct dynamics of co-modified peptides upon T cell activation, demonstrating differential regulation of co-occurring PTMs in this biological context. Overall, TCellXTalk enables the experimental detection of co-modified peptides in human T cells and puts forward a novel and generic strategy for the study of PTM cross-talk.

The fragmentation spectra were searched with the Sequest HT engine against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot human database (canonical and isoform sequences, release 2016_05) using the following parameters: trypsin, maximum 3 missed cleavages, 20 ppm precursor mass tolerance, 0.6 Da fragment mass tolerance, cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine and acetylation of lysine as dynamic modifications. Peptide spectral matches were filtered for “search engine rank 1” and 1 % false discovery rate using Percolator (Kall 2007, Spivak 2009). The localization probability for each K-Ac site was calculated using ptmRS (version 1.4) (Taus 2011) and only K-Ac peptides with sites localized with a probability ≥75 % were annotated as modified peptides in the database. Because acetylation blocks tryptic cleavage (Zee 2012), K-Ac sites mapped to a peptide C-terminal lysine residue were excluded from the database except when the site coincided with the protein C-terminal residue. For quantitative analysis of co-modified peptides in CD3 proteins, peptide abundance was determined by a label-free approach using the Progenesis QI for proteomics software (v3.0, Nonlinear Dynamics). Peptides were identified with Proteome Discoverer as described above considering oxidation of methionine, GG addition to lysine, and phosphorylation of serine, tyrosine or threonine as dynamic modifications. Peptide-spectrum matches were filtered for “search engine rank 1” and 5 % false discovery rate using Percolator. The peptide identifications were imported and matched to the corresponding features across the different runs. PTM site probabilities derived from ptmRS were integrated in the Progenesis output file and data was further processed using custom scripts. Peptides with a K-ε-GG site mapped to a peptide C-terminal lysine were removed and only peptides with all sites localized with a probability ≥75 % were kept. MS3 spectra were interpreted manually for identification of co-modified peptides.	2018-06-21	"[[""PMID:30219844"",""DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty805""]]"

We show that the mammalian spliceosome specifically associates with the S5P CTD isoform of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) as it elongates across spliced exons of protein coding genes, both in human Hela and murine lymphoid cell lines. Immuno-precipitation of MNase digested chromatin with phospho CTD specific antibodies reveals that components of the active spliceosome (both snRNA and proteins) form a specific complex with S5P CTD Pol II. Furthermore a dominant splicing intermediate formed by cleavage at intron 5’ss results in the tethering of upstream exons to this complex at all spliced exons. These are invariably connected to upstream spliced constitutive and less frequently to alternative exons. Finally S5P CTD Pol II accumulates over spliced exons but not adjacent introns. We propose that mammalian splicing employs a rapid, co-transcriptional splicing mechanism based on CTD phosphorylation transitions.

To understand the impact of alternative translation initiation on a proteome, we performed the first large-scale study of protein turnover rates in which we distinguish between N-terminal proteoforms pointing to translation initiation events. Using pulsed SILAC combined with N-terminal COFRADIC we monitored the stability of 1,941human N-terminal proteoforms, including 147 proteoform pairs with heterogeneous N-termini originating from the same gene that result from alternative translation initiation and incomplete processing of the initiator methionine. N-terminally truncated proteoforms were on average less abundant than canonical proteoforms, many had different stabilities and exhibited both faster and slower turnover rates compared to their canonical counterparts. These differences in stability did not depend on the length of truncation but on individual protein characteristics. In silico simulation of N-terminal proteoforms in macromolecular complexes revealed possible consequences for complex integrity such as replacement of unstable canonical subunits. The extent of intrinsic disorder in N-terminal protein structures correlated with turnover times, indicating that a change in the structural flexibility of protein N-termini in truncated proteoforms might impact proteoform stability. Interestingly, removal of the initiator methionine by methionine aminopeptidases reduced the stability of processed proteoforms while susceptibility for N-terminal acetylation, another common co-translational modification, did not seem to impact on turnover rates. Taken together, our findings reveal differences in protein stability between N-terminal proteoforms and point to a role for alternative translation initiation and co-translational initiator methionine removal in the overall regulation of proteome homeostasis.

As a direct partner of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) it mediates interactions with diverse RNA processing and transport machineries in a transcript-dependent manner. Here we present the human ARS2 crystal structure, which exhibits similarities and metazoan-specific differences to the plant homologue SERRATE, most notably an additional RRM domain. We present biochemical, biophysical and cellular interactome data comparing wild type and mutant ARS2 that identify regions critical for interactions with FLASH (involved in histone mRNA biogenesis), NCBP3 (a putative cap-binding protein involved in mRNA export) and single-stranded RNA. We show that FLASH and NCBP3 have overlapping binding sites on ARS2 and that CBC-ARS2-NCBP3 form a ternary complex that is mutually exclusive with CBC-ARS-PHAX (involved in snRNA export). Our results support that mutually exclusive higher order CBC-ARS2 complexes are critical in determining Pol II transcript fate.

987	PXD000171	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000171	The effect of proteasome inhibition on the HLA peptidome	The Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptidome is thought to be generated mostly through proteasomal degradation of cellular proteins, a notion that is based on the alterations in presentation of selected peptides following proteasome inhibition. We evaluated the effects of proteasome inhibitors, epoxomicin and bortezomib, on human cultured cancer cells. Since the inhibitors did not reduce the level of presentation of the cell surface human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, we followed their effects on the rates of synthesis of both HLA peptidome and proteome of the cells, using dynamic stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (dynamic-SILAC). The inhibitors reduced the rates of synthesis of most cellular proteins and HLA peptides, yet the synthesis rates of some of the proteins and HLA peptides was not decreased by the inhibitors and of some even increased. Therefore, we concluded that the inhibitors affected the production of the HLA peptidome in a complex manner, including modulation of the synthesis rates of the source proteins of the HLA peptides in addition to their effect on their degradation. The collected data may suggest that the current reliance on proteasome inhibition may overestimate the centrality of the proteasome in the generation of the MHC peptidome. It is therefore suggested that the relative contribution of the proteasomal and non-proteasomal pathways to the production of the MHC peptidome should be revaluated in accordance with the inhibitors effects on the synthesis rates of the source proteins of the MHC peptides. Bioinformatics & data processing: Peptides were identified and the dynamic-SILAC data were quantified using the MaxQuant and the Proteome Discoverer software tools. Graphical representation of the bioinformatics results was performed with Perseus, version 1.3.0.4.

Methionine oxidation was accepted as variable modification for both tryptic and HLA peptides. Carbamidomethyl cysteine and n-acetylation were accepted as modification for the proteomics analyses. Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids and a maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed for tryptic peptides. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set for tryptic peptides to 0.01 for protein identifications, and 0.05 for the MHC peptides.

Extensive high-throughput sequencing led to the characterization of four MB subgroups (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4) delineated with distinct molecular signatures and clinical outcomes. However, up-to-date these analyses have not attained the global comprehension of their dynamic network complexity. Wishing to uncover a comprehensive view of all MB subgroups we employed a proteomic analysis to integrate accurate protein expression and activity that should ultimately give rise to a realistic picture of how MB cancer cells are regulated. In this study we present the first analysis regrouping methylation status, whole-transcriptome sequencing and quantitative proteomics (proteome and phosphoproteome) using a super SILAC / spiked in strategy across 38 flash frozen primary human MBs (5 WNT, 10 SHH, 10 Group 3 and 13 Group 4). First, our data pinpointed that proteomic analysis could reveal MB subgroup identity. Second, analysis of proteome and phosphoproteome highlighted disregulated signaling pathways that have not been predicted by transcriptomic analysis. Altogether, combined multi-scale analyses of MB have allowed us to identify unrevealed pathways involved in human MB genesis and progression.

These include the analysis of metabolites, cells as well as proteins. For identifying new suitable diagnostic protein biomarkers bottom-up data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry-based approaches are most popular. Drawbacks of this method are stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection. Recently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) emerged as an alternative method. It overcomes several limitations of DDA, since it combines the benefits of DDA and targeted methods like selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We established a DIA method for in-depth proteome analysis of CSF. For this, four spectral libraries were generated with samples from native CSF (n=5) CSF fractionation (15 in total) and substantia nigra fractionation (54 in total) applying to CSF DIA of three replicates. The DDA and DIA methods for CSF were conducted with the same nanoLC parameters using a 180 minute gradient. Compared to a conventional DDA method, our DIA approach both increased the number of identified protein groups with 1574 compared to DDA with 648 over 50 % with a comprehensive spectral library (generated with DDA measurements from five native CSF and 54 substantia nigra fractions) and decreased the coefficient of variation to 6 %, compared to 11 % with a DDA method. We also could show that a sample specific spectral library generated only from native CSF increased the identification reproducibility from three DIA replicates to 90 % (77 % with a DDA method). Moreover, by utilizing a substantia nigra specific spectral library for CSF DIA over 60 brain-originated proteins could be identified compared to only eleven with DDA. In conclusion, the here presented optimized DIA method substantially outperforms DDA and could develop into a powerful tool for biomarker discovery in CSF.

Four different spectral libraries were generated (with mass spectrometry proteomics data from the DDA analysis  deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE39 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD010698  for native CSF, PXD009624 for fractionated CSF and PXD010690 for substantia nigra) by using Spectronaut 9.0 (Biognosys). Therefore, different .MSF files from PD were uploaded to the “Prepare” perspective of Spectronaut and treated with the following settings: for identification only peptides with high confidence level (equals a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%) were considered and protein inference was performed by Spectronaut. Spectral Library Filters were set to no missed cleavage filters, no peptide charge filters, number of best fragment ions between 3 and 6 in a mass range of 300 – 1800 m/z.

Increasing evidence indicate that individual GalNAc-Ts co-regulate and fine-tune specific protein functions in health and disease, and deficiencies in individual GALNT genes underlie congenital diseases with distinct phenotypes. Studies of GalNAc-T specificities have mainly been performed with in vitro enzyme assays using short peptide substrate, but recently quantitative differential O-glycoproteomics of isogenic cells with and without GALNT genes has enabled a more unbiased exploration of the non-redundant contributions of individual GalNAc-Ts. Both approaches suggest that fairly small subsets of O-glycosites are non-redundantly regulated by specific GalNAc-Ts, but how these isoenzymes orchestrate regulation amongst competing redundant substrates is unclear. To explore this, we developed isogenic cell model systems with Tet-On inducible expression of two GalNAc-T genes, GALNT2 and GALNT11, in a knockout background. Using quantitative O-glycoproteomics with TMT labelling we found that isoform-specific glycosites were glycosylated in a dose dependent manner, and induction of GalNAc-T2 or T11 produced discrete glycosylation effects without affecting the major part of the glycoproteome. The results support the findings that individual GalNAc-T isoenzymes can serve in fine-tuned regulation of distinct protein functions	"[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]"		"[{""ptm"":""iodoacetamide derivatized residue"",""UNIMOD"":""4""},{""ptm"":""TMT6plex-126 reporter+balance reagent acylated residue""},{""ptm"":""monohydroxylated residue"",""UNIMOD"":""35""}]"	"[""LTQ Orbitrap""]"	"[""Biological""]"	"[""Shotgun proteomics""]"	"[""TMT""]"	Inducible expression, O-glycosylation, glycoproteomics, GalNAc-transferase, mass spectrometry	Data processing was performed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software (Thermo Scientific) using Sequest HT Node as previously described (1) with minor changes. Briefly, all spectra were initially searched with full cleavage specificity, filtered according to the confidence level (medium, low and unassigned) and further searched with the semi-specific enzymatic cleavage. In all cases the precursor mass tolerance was set to 6 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance to 20 mmu. Carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues was used as a fixed modification. Methionine oxidation and HexNAc attachment to serine, threonine and tyrosine were used as variable modifications for ETD MS2. All HCD MS2 were pre-processed as described (1) and searched under the same conditions mentioned above using only methionine oxidation as variable modification.    For the quantitative analysis only HCD MS2 spectra were used. In the case of ETD MS2 spectra the group of TMT reporter fragment ions (m/z range of 126-132) was extracted from the adjacent HCD MS2 spectrum (the same precursor ions), concatenated with the corresponding ETD MS2 spectrum and later used for quantification.

1000	PXD010207	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD010207	TMEM41B is a novel regulator of autophagy and lipid mobilization	Autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis by targeting damaged organelles, pathogens or misfolded protein aggregates for lysosomal degradation. The autophagic process is initiated by the formation of autophagosomes, which can selectively enclose cargo via autophagy cargo receptors. A machinery of well-characterized autophagy-related proteins orchestrate the biogenesis of autophagosomes, however, the origin of the required membranes is incompletely understood.  Here, we applied sensitized pooled CRISPR screens and identified the uncharacterized transmembrane protein TMEM41B as a novel regulator of autophagy. In the absence of TMEM41B, autophagosome biogenesis is stalled, LC3 accumulates at WIPI2- and DFCP1-positive isolation membranes, and lysosomal flux of autophagy cargo receptors and intracellular bacteria is impaired. In addition to defective autophagy, we found that TMEM41B knockout cells display significantly enlarged lipid droplets and reduced mobilization and β-oxidation of fatty acids. TMEM41B localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interacts with SIGMAR1, a chaperone which regulates calcium and lipid transfer at ER contact sites with mitochondria and lipid droplets. Taken together, we propose that TMEM41B is a novel regulator of autophagosome biogenesis and ER lipid mobilization.

Tumour cells in these starved regions sense reduced levels of oxygen and switch on genes that help them to adapt, survive and continue growing. Since hypoxia is a key physiological difference between normal and cancer tissue, an opportunity exists to selectively kill tumour cells by exploiting the differences in protein expression between normal and hypoxic tumour tissue. However, a major challenge is to identify druggable hypoxia-induced proteins critical for tumour cell survival. This is especially important in cancers of unmet need where hypoxia gene signatures correlate with poor prognosis (for example, colorectal cancers). To identify new hypoxia-induced proteins, we performed SILAC-based proteomics on colorectal cancer cells exposed to normoxia and hypoxia. In this study, we identify a new hypoxia-activated GPCR signalling axis that enables colorectal tumour cells to survive the microenvironmental stress of hypoxia. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated role for this GPCR-axis as a key regulator of the adaptive response to hypoxia and highlght an opportunity to exploit tumour-associated hypoxia for therapy.

Previous analyses of proteins extracted from ancient dental calculus revealed the presence of the dietary milk protein β-lactoglobulin, providing direct evidence of dairy consumption in the archaeological record. However, the potential for calculus to preserve other food-related proteins has not yet been systematically explored. Here we analyse shotgun metaproteomic data from 100 archaeological dental calculus samples ranging from the Iron Age to the post-medieval period (8thC BC - 19thC AD) in Britain, as well as dental calculus from contemporary dental patients and recently deceased individuals, to characterise the range and extent of dietary proteins preserved in dental calculus. In addition to milk proteins, we detected proteomic evidence of foodstuffs such as cereals and plant products, as well as the digestive enzyme salivary amylase. We discuss the importance of optimized protein extraction methods, data analysis approaches, and authentication strategies in the identification of dietary proteins from archaeological dental calculus. Our ability to detect dietary proteins, although limited, demonstrates the potential of these methods to robustly identify foodstuffs in the archaeological record that are under-represented due to their poor preservation.

Recent developments are enabling increasingly sophisticated phosphoproteomics studies, but practical challenges remain. The EasyPhos workflow addresses these, and is sufficiently streamlined to enable analysis of hundreds of phosphoproteomes at a depth of >10,000 quantified phosphorylation sites. Here we present a detailed and updated protocol that further ensures high performance in sample-limited conditions, while also reducing sample preparation time. By eliminating protein precipitation steps and performing the entire protocol including digestion in a single 96-well plate, we now greatly minimize opportunities for sample loss and variability. This results in very high reproducibility and low sample requirements of 200 Î¼g of protein starting material or less. After cell culture or tissue collection, the protocol takes 1 d, whereas mass spectrometry measurements require 1 h per sample. Applied to glioblastoma cells acutely treated with EGF, EasyPhos quantified 20,132 distinct phosphopeptides from 200 Î¼g protein in less than one day of measurement time, revealing thousands of EGF-regulated phosphorylation events.

In total, N = 60 individuals were included in this sub-study, including n = 36 with early symptomatic stage (primary/secondary), n = 13 early latent and n = 5 late latent stage and n = 6 controls. Almost all participants were HIV-positive (56/60; 93 %) and identified as men who have sex with men (MSM) (59/60; 98 %). Sixteen (27 %) individuals were serum PCR positive for T. pallidum at the time of diagnosis. Ten pools containing urine from six participants (±1.5 mL per individual) were created based on clinical staging. Urine protein was extracted from the pools by a two-step molecular weight cut-off centrifugal filtration to remove large proteins and non-protein material. Samples were digested, subjected to multi-dimensional liquid chromatographic separation based on hydrophobicity and were analysed with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and/or liquid chromatography- electrospray ionization quadruple ion mobility time-of-flight high-definition mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-Q-IM-TOF) in data dependent (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and data independent HDMSE (ESI-IM-Q-TOF) acquisition modes. Results In total, 26 peptides corresponding to four unique T. pallidum proteins were uncovered in four different pooled urine samples, from n = 3 symptomatic (primary/secondary stage; PSS) and n = 1 latent stage pool. Peptides from GTPase Obg (Tp0742) were detected in two separate PSS pooled samples. Protein designations are listed as in the currently annotated T. pallidum proteome available at the UniProt database (Proteome ID: UP000014259) which is related to the genome assembly and annotation ID GCA_000410535.2 listed on the European Nucleotide Archive. Eleven peptides from an uncharacterized protein (Tp0369) and 8 peptides from a protein annotated as the Borrelia-like p83/100 protein (Tp0486) were detected in two different PSS pooled samples. A protein annotated as an ABC superfamily transport protein (Tp0804) was uncovered in a latent stage pooled sample. BLAST analyses revealed low peptide sequence similarity with other pathogenic and commensal prokaryotes and human proteins. Conclusions High resolution mass spectrometric analyses of protein extracts from pooled urine samples resulted in the detection of four T. pallidum proteins. This is the first successful account of applying proteomics approaches to detect treponemal antigens in clinical samples. These proteins could represent potential biomarkers for downstream diagnostic applications.

We focused on Anxa1 because it is one of the major proteins upregulated in imatinib-sensitive KCL22S cells versus imatinib-resistant KCL22R. Our proteomic strategy revealed 21 interactors. Bioinformatic analysis showed that most of these proteins are involved in cell death processes. Among the proteins identified, we studied the interaction of Anxa1 with two phosphatases, Shp1 and Shp2, which were recently identified as biomarkers of imatinib sensitivity in patients affected by chronic myeloid leukemia. Our data open new perspectives in the search for annexin-mediated signaling pathways and may shed light on mechanisms of resistance to imatinib that are unrelated to Bcr-Abl activity. For data analysis, we used the MASCOT software (version 2.4) Peptide Mass Fingerprinting search program (http://www.matrixscience.com) selecting NCBInr aug2010 database (11592891 sequences) (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov), and the following six parameters: specificity of the proteolytic enzyme used for hydrolysis (trypsin); up to 1 missed cleavage; cysteines such as S-carbamidomethylcysteines; unmodified N- and C-terminal ends; unmodified and oxidized methionines; putative Gln-induced pyroGlu formation; a precursor peptide maximum mass tolerance of 400 ppm, and a maximum fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da. Using the probability-based Mowse score, the ion score is 10 x Log(p), p being the probability that an eventual match is a random occurrence. All MS/MS spectra with a MASCOT score of or higher than 41 (p =< 0.05) had a good S/N, so the interpretation of the data was unambiguous. MS/MS spectra of peptides that had a MASCOT score below 41 were inspected manually and included in the statistics only in the presence of at least four continuous y or b ions.

The pathophysiology of post-infectious and idiopathic olfactory loss is still poorly delineated. Since proteins are key players in olfaction and technical advances including LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry give us the opportunity for detailed analysis of the nasal mucus proteome we aimed to undertake a comparative analysis of the olfactory cleft mucus proteome using mucus samples of the olfactory cleft in patients with idiopathic and postinfectious olfactory disorders versus healthy controls. The study was conceived as a pilot study and included 7 patients with idiopathic hyp- and anosmia, 7 patients with postinfectious hyp- and anosmia and 7 healthy controls. In total, 1117 different proteins were detected in at least 5 patients in at least one group. No significant different overall protein concentrations in patients compared to healthy controls (0.4614 µg/µL, SD=0.26273 vs. 0.5143 µg/µL, SD=3087; p=0.689) were found.  Significant correlation regarding olfactory test results (TDI score) and protein concentrations (r=0.114, p=0.623) were either found. Results of this study did not show significant differences regarding the proteomic composition of the olfactory cleft mucus between patients suffering from postinfectious and idiopathic dysosmia versus healthy controls. Thus, central olfactory processing pathways may play a role in idiopathic and postinfectious olfactory disorders.

In biomarker studies, because of normal clinical or biological variabil-ity, candidate biomarkers need to be validated across a large number of samples. To ensure that the discovered biomarkers are truly associated with oocytes quality and fertilization rather than the result of variability, three independent experiments were designed with a large population. In the present study, we investigated the peptide profile of human follicular fluid with fertilized and non-fertilized oocytes from patients undergoing in vitro fertilization using proteomic analysis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We additionally determined the protein identi-ties of the discovered peptide biomarkers as a first step toward understanding the pathways in which they may function.

In particular, phosphoproteomics of MM has become of significant importance because of the central role that phosphorylation plays in the development of MM. Investigating clinical samples, however, is an extremely challenging task as there is usually only very limited quantities of material available to perform targeted enrichment approaches. Here, an automated phosphopeptide enrichment protocol using the AssayMap Bravo platform was applied to MM tissues and assessed for performance. The strategy proved to be highly-sensitive, less prone to variability, less laborious than existing techniques and adequate for starting quantities at the microgram level. An Fe(III)-NTA-IMAC-based enrichment workflow was applied to a dilution series of MM tissue lysates. The workflow was efficient in terms of sensitivity, reproducibility and phosphosite localization; and from only 12.5 µg of sample, more than 1,000 phosphopeptides were identified. In addition, from 60 µg of protein material the number of identified phosphoproteins from individual MM samples was comparable to previous reports that used extensive fractionation methods. Our data set included key pathways that are involved in MM progression; such as MAPK, melanocyte development and integrin signaling. Moreover, tissue-specific immunological proteins were identified, that have not been previously observed in the proteome of MM-derived cell lines. In conclusion, this workflow is suitable to study large cohorts of clinical samples that demand automatic and careful handling.

Briefly, wiff files were converted into mzXML files using ProteoWizard (Kessner et al., 2008) msconvert v.3.0.3316, and then mzML files using OpenMS (Sturm et al., 2008) tool FileConverter. OpenSWATH was performed using the tool OpenSWATHWorkflow with input files including the mzXML file, the TraML library file, and TraML file for iRT peptides. The false discovery rate for peptide identification was below 0.1%. High confidence peptide features from different samples were aligned using the algorithm TRansition of Identification Confidence (TRIC) (version r238), which is available from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/msproteomicstools or https://code.google.com/p/msproteomicstools/. The following parameters for the feature_alignment.py are as follows: max_rt_diff = 30, method = global_best_overall, nr_high_conf_exp = 2, target_fdr = 0.001, use_score_filter = 1.  Protein quantification The concentration of each protein is quantified through the simultaneous measurement of several peptides. To optimize the protein quantification, we developed a new computational method, which combines maximally consistent peptides for each protein and excludes inconsistent (i.e. uncorrelated) peptides (Picotti et al., 2013). Given a set of peptides unambiguously assigned to a single protein, consistent peptides were selected using the following procedure: all pairwise correlations between all peptides of a protein across the samples were calculated at first. Peptide pairs with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of at least 0.3 were determined, resulting in clusters of correlated peptides. This procedure yielded one or more peptide clusters per protein. We used the largest cluster of each protein and we quantified the protein’s concentration as the average intensity across the peptides in that cluster. The minimum cluster size was set to 2 and proteins without a cluster of at least two correlated peptides were removed from the subsequent analysis. This procedure resulted in very robust concentration estimates for 1906 proteins with high correlation between technical replicates (R ≥ 0.95) and no missing values.  60 samples with 1,906 proteins quantified in each sample were clustered by heatmap in R. To further visualize the sample similarities, the protein intensity matrix was firstly turned to distance matrix by dist function, then turned to newick tree file by as.phylo function, and finally plotted by Figtree software.	2016-07-18	"[[""DOI:10.26508/lsa.201800042"",""PMID:30090875""]]"

1030	PXD007740	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD007740	A system-wide approach to monitor responses to synergistic BRAF and EGFR inhibition in colorectal cancer cells	Molecular heterogeneity of tumors, epigenetic changes and a diverse range of molecular mechanisms are main contributors to drug resistance, which represents one of the great challenges in cancer treatment. A deeper understanding of the molecular biology of cancer has resulted in better targeted therapies, where one or multiple drugs are adopted in novel therapies to tackle resistance. This beneficial effect of using combination treatments has to some extent also been observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation, whereby dual inhibition of BRAF(V600E) and EGFR increases antitumor activity. Notwithstanding this success, it is not clear whether this combination treatment is the only or most effective treatment to block resistance. Here, we investigate molecular responses upon single and multi-target treatments, over time, using BRAF(V600E) mutant CRC cells as a well-define model system. Through integration of transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomics data we obtain a comprehensive overview, revealing both well-known and novel responses. We primarily observe widespread upregulation of tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and and metabolic pathways. This points to by which the treated cells switch energy sources as a defensive response entering a quiescent like state, while activating signalling to re-activate the MAPK pathway.

Repeat expansions in C9ORF72, the major cause of ALS, reduce C9ORF72 levels but how this impacts stress granules is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that C9ORF72 associates with the autophagy receptor p62 and controls elimination of stress granules by autophagy. This requires p62 to associate via the Tudor protein SMN with proteins, including FUS, that are symmetrically arginine-methylated by PRMT5. Mice lacking p62 accumulate arginine-methylated proteins and alterations in FUS-dependent splicing.  Finally, patients with C9ORF72 repeat expansions accumulate symmetric arginine dimethylated proteins which co-localize with p62. This suggests that C9ORF72 initiates a cascade of ALS-linked proteins (C9ORF72, p62, SMN, FUS) to recognize stress granules for degradation by autophagy and hallmarks of a defect in this process are observable in ALS patients.

Oncolytic adenoviruses are being modified to exploit the aberrant expression of proteins in tumor cells to enhance tumor tropism and glioma-selective replication. E1A mutant adenovirus Delta-24-RGD has shown favorable toxicity profile and remarkable efficacy in a first-in-human phase I clinical trial. However, the comprehensive modulation of glioma metabolism in response to Delta-24-RGD infection is poorly understood. Integrating mass spectrometry based-quantitative proteomics, physical and functional interaction data, and biochemical approaches, we conducted a cell-wide study of cytosolic, nuclear, and secreted glioma proteomes throughout the early time course of Delta-24-RGD infection.

Relative quantification and protein identification were performed with the ProteinPilot™ software (version 5.0; Sciex) using the Paragon™ algorithm as the search engine. The search parameters allowed for cysteine modification by MMTS and biological modifications programm in the algorithm (i.e. phosphorylations, amidations, semitryptic fragments, etc.). Reporter ion intensities were bias corrected for the overlapping isotope contributions from the iTRAQ tags according to the certificate of analysis provided by the reagent manufacturer (Sciex). The peptide and protein selection criteria for relative quantitation were performed as follows. Only peptides unique for a given protein were considered for relative quantitation, excluding those common to other isoforms or proteins of the same family. Proteins were identified on the basis of having at least one peptide with an ion score above 99% confidence. Among the identified peptides, some of them were excluded from the quantitative analysis for one of the following reasons: (i) The peaks corresponding to the iTRAQ labels were not detected; (ii) the peptides were identified with low identification confidence (<1.0%); (iii) the sum of the signal-to-noise ratio for all of the peak pairs was <6 for the peptide ratios. The protein sequence coverage (95% conf.) was estimated for specific proteins by the percentage of matching amino acids from the identified peptides having confidence greater than or equal to 95% divided by the total number of amino acids in the sequence. Several quantitative estimates provided for each protein by ProteinPilot were utilized: the fold change ratios of differential expression between labelled protein extracts; the p-value, representing the probability that the observed ratio is different than 1 by chance. A decoy database search strategy was also used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR), defined as the percentage of decoy proteins identified against the total protein identification. The FDR was calculated by searching the spectra against the decoy database generated from the target database. The results were then exported into Excel for manual data interpretation. Although relative quantification and statistical analysis were provided by the ProteinPilot software, an additional 1.3-fold change cutoff for all iTRAQ ratios (ratio <0.77 or >1.3) and a p-value lower tan 0.05 were selected to classify proteins as up- or down-regulated (at least in two of three biological replicates). Proteins with iTRAQ ratios below the low range (0.77) were considered to be underexpressed, whereas those above the high range (1.3) were considered to be overexpressed.	2017-10-23	"[[""DOI:10.18632/oncotarget.25774"",""PMID:30123426""]]"

A striking feature of this disease is that a range of different mutations in ribosomal proteins results in similar disease phenotypes primarily characterized by erythrocyte abnormalities and macrocytic anemia, while most other cell types are minimally affected. Previously, we analyzed the erythrocyte membrane proteomes of several DBA patients and identified several proteins that are not typically associated with this cell type that suggested inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of DBA.  In this study, we evaluated the erythrocyte cytosolic proteome of DBA patients through in-depth analysis of hemoglobin-depleted erythrocyte cytosol.  The simple, reproducible, hemoglobin depletion using nickel columns enabled in-depth analysis of over 1000 cytosolic erythrocyte proteins with minimal subsequent fractionation of the proteome.  Label-free quantitation and statistical analysis identified 29 proteins that were significantly changed in DBA patients compared to matched healthy control donors.  Some of the proteins that were significantly increased in DBA erythrocyte cytoplasm included three proteasome subunit beta proteins that make up the immunoproteasome and proteins induced by interferon-γ such as n-myc interactor and interferon-induced 25 kDa protein [NMI and IFI35 respectively].  Pathway analysis confirmed the presence of an inflammatory signature with erythrocytes of DBA patients and predicted key upstream regulators including mitogen activated kinase 1, interferon-γ, tumor suppressor p53, and tumor necrosis factor.  These results show that erythrocytes in DBA patients are intrinsically different from those in healthy controls which may be due to an inflammatory response resulting from the inherent molecular defect of ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency or changes in the bone marrow microenvironment that leads to red cell aplasia in DBA patients.

Data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods aim to expand the benefits of low-throughput targeted proteomics to proteome-wide analyses. These methods rely on the use of several broadband isolation windows that select and fragment all peptide ions within a cycle. Isolation windows differ in that (I) they exhibit different widths, (ii) they are acquired either sequentially or in a non-consecutive order, and (iii) they are either juxtaposed or overlapped. Here we present DIA+, a novel DIA multiplexing scheme with isolation windows that combine signals from identical peptides with different charges. DIA+ is based on the co-isolation of charge +2 and +3 precursor ions from identical peptide sequences to combine their signal and therefore, increase the number of MS2 peptide fragment ions detected. DIA+ combines three non-consecutive m/z ranges, based on the mass difference between charge +2 and +3 peptides, into a composite 24 Da isolation window. Forty of these combined 24 Da windows cover a range of 400-1350 m/z. The performance of DIA+ was compared with other reference methods in the field, and with a DIA+ control method in which each 24 Da isolation window results from the combination of three consecutive m/z ranges. The combination of improved signal-to-noise and sequence coverage increases the confidence on peptide identification and results in a significant increase in the number of identified peptides and proteins.

Histone 4 Lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) serves a unique role amongst the many histone modifications as it directly affects chromatin structure1. The Male Specific Lethal (MSL) complex associated MOF/KAT8 histone acetyl transferase is responsible for bulk H4K16ac in flies and mammals. Yet, its importance during human development and a potential involvement in human pathologies remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover that pathogenic variants in MSL3, a component of the MSL complex, are causative for a new recognizable X-linked syndrome affecting Histone 4 Lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) in both male and female individuals. Common clinical features of the syndrome include global developmental delay comprising profound speech delay, delayed ability to walk and craniofacial dysmorphism. Using patient-derived primary fibroblasts, we demonstrate that de novo variants or deletions of MSL3 affect the assembly and enzymatic activity of the MSL complex, hence impacting on global H4K16ac levels. Transcriptome analysis from patient cells showed misregulation of cellular pathways involved in serotonergic signaling, morphogenesis, axon guidance and cell structure. Finally, using HDAC inhibitor treatment, we can rescue expression of downregulated target genes, offering potential therapeutic avenues for MSL3-mutated patients. Taken together, we characterize a novel syndrome, named ILyADe (Impaired Lysine 16 acetylation associated disorder), which is caused by mutations of an epigenetic regulator, allowing us for the first time to unravel the crucial role of H4K16ac during human development. ILyaDe thus constitutes a new class of syndromes associated with misregulation of a single epigenetic modification caused by a genetic alteration.

Furthermore, early detection of GBM, such as by a routine blood test, may improve survival, even with the current treatment modalities. This study includes large-scale analyses of the HLA peptidome (immunopeptidome) of the plasma-soluble HLA molecules (sHLA) of 142 plasma samples and the membranal HLA of GBM tumors of 10 tumor samples of the same patients. Tumor samples were fresh-frozen immediately after surgery and plasma samples were collected before, and at multiple visits after surgery. In total, this HLA peptidome analysis involved 52 different HLA allotypes and resulted in the identification of more than 35,000 different HLA peptides. Strong correlations were observed in the signal intensities and in the repertoires of identified peptides between the tumors and plasma-soluble HLA peptidomes of the same patients; yet, low correlations were observed between these HLA peptidomes and the tumors’ proteomes. HLA peptides derived from Cancer/Testis Antigens (CTAs) were selected based on their presence among the HLA peptidomes of the patients and absence of expression of their source genes from any healthy and essential human tissues, except from immune-privileged sites. Additionally, peptides were selected as potential biomarkers if their levels in the plasma-sHLA peptidome were significantly reduced after the removal of tumor mass. The CTAs identified among the analyzed HLA peptidomes provide new opportunities for personalized immunotherapy and for early diagnosis of GBM.

Peptide identifications were based on the human section of the Uniprot database (http://www.uniprot.org/) of July 2015 containing 69,693 entries. Proteins were declared positive identification with at least two identified tryptic peptides per protein. Mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm for the precursor masses and 20 ppm for the fragments were allowed. Methionine oxidation was accepted as variable modification for both tryptic and HLA peptides. Carbamidomethyl cysteine was accepted as a fixed modification for the proteomics data and as a variable modification for the HLA peptidome data. Methionine sulfoxide and n-acetylation were set as variable modifications for both the proteomics and HLA peptidomics analyses. Minimal peptide length was set to seven amino acids and a maximum of two miscleavages was allowed for tryptic peptides. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set for tryptic peptides to 0.01 for protein identifications, and 0.05 for the HLA peptides. The resulting identified protein tables were filtered to eliminate the identifications derived from the reverse database, as well as common contaminants.  Normalization of the HLA peptidome and proteome Data: The HLA peptidome of each of the LC-MS/MS runs was normalized according to its median. The medians were zeroed, and down-regulated HLA peptides were defined as those changing by at least two folds in the plasma samples collected immediately before surgery relative to samples collected at later clinic visits. The proteome LC-MS/MS data was normalized using the LFQ and iBAQ tools of the MaxQuant software.	2019-06-06	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra118.000792"",""PMID:30072578""],[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra119.001524"",""PMID:31154438""]]"

OMICs technologies cannot be applied on clinically precious human material as this is required in its integrity for routine pathology investigation. Hence all OMICs discovery today is done on residual and not clinically relevant material. In the study, we present a novel, non-destructive, procedure named EXPEL, which uses rapid, pressure-assisted, interstitial fluid extrusion, allowing for full clinical pathology and OMICs analysis (proteins, metabolites, miRNA and DNA) on the same specimen. To demonstrate this we engage in a simultaneous biomarker discovery and routine diagnostic analysis of human colorectal cancer and liver metastases. Biomarkers discovered with EXPEL methodology can be readily detected in human sera, allowing for unprecedented translation to the clinic. EXPEL method enables for the first time both clinicians and scientist to explore identical, fresh, clinical material regardless of origin and size.

Current diagnosis of HF relies on clinical evaluation, blood assays and imaging techniques at the time of diagnosis. Our aim is to develop a diagnostic assay to detect HF early in at risk individuals within the community using human saliva as a medium, paving the way towards precision medicine.  Methods: Saliva samples were collected from healthy controls (n=36) and HF patients (n=75). Salivary proteome profiles were analysed by Sequential Window Acquisition of All Theoretical fragment ion spectra – Mass Spectrometry (SWATH-MS). A total of 738 proteins were quantified and 177 proteins demonstrated significant differences in saliva from HF patients and healthy controls.  Candidate biomarkers were chosen based on their abundance and difference between the two cohorts. A multi-protein panel was developed using logistic regression analysis. The diagnostic performance of the multi-protein panel was assessed using the receiver operative characteristic curves. The candidate proteins were further validated technically, using western blot analysis as well as biologically, using an independent cohor.t. Results: A group of six proteins were chosen as potential protein candidates based on their differences in the abundance between the two cohorts. During the validation phase, two of the proteins were eliminated as these did not meet our criteria. The panel consists of four proteins with sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 62.5% with an area under ROC curve of 0.78 in discriminating healthy controls from NYHA class I/II HF patients.  Conclusion: Analysis of salivary proteome using SWATH-MS analysis revealed novel HF-specific protein candidates when combined into a panel yielding high diagnostic performance. A multi-centre longitudinal clinical trial will be the next step before clinical implementation of this panel. 	"[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]"	"[""saliva""]"	"[{""ptm"":""No PTMs are included in the dataset""}]"	"[""TripleTOF 5600""]"	"[""Biomedical""]"	"[""SWATH MS""]"		Heart failure; Saliva; diagnosis; mass spectrometry; multi-biomarker strategies	Peptide identification was performed by the Protein Pilot 4.1 software (SCIEX) using the LudwigNR database (downloaded from http://apcf.edu.au as at 27 January 2012; 16 818 973 sequences; 5 891 363 821 residues) with the following setting: Sample Type, identification; cysteine alkylation, acrylamide; instrument, TripleTof 5600; Species, human; ID focus, Biological modification; enzyme, trypsin; Search effort, thorough ID.

The apoptotic phenotype and mechanism by which it induces cell death however, remain poorly understood and controversial. Here, we show that GrM-induced cell death was largely caspase-dependent with various hallmarks of classical apoptosis, coinciding with caspase-independent G2/M cell cycle arrest. Using positional proteomics in HeLa cells, we identified the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase II alpha (topoII alpha) as a physiological substrate of GrM. Cleavage of topoII alpha by GrM at Leu1280 dissected topoII aplha functional domains from the nuclear localization signals, leading to nuclear exit of topoII alpha catalytic activity into the cytoplasm, and rendering it nonfunctional. Similar to the apoptotic phenotype of GrM, topoII aplha depletion in tumor cells led to cell cycle arrest in G2/M, mitochondrial perturbations, caspase activation, and apoptosis. We conclude that cytotoxic lymphocyte GrM targets topoII aplha to trigger cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis.  Raw data files were processed with Mascot distiller 2.3. The mgf files were searched with Mascot daemon 2.3. The quantification was also done by Mascot Distiller. All data was stored in ms_lims.

As OPSCCs are often diagnosed at an advanced stage, mortality and morbidity remain high. There are no diagnostic biomarkers for early stage detection of OPSCC.  Serum from 25 patients with stage I-II OPSCC and 12 disease- individuals were studied with quantitative label-free proteomics using ultra-definition MSE. Statistical analyses were performed to identify proteins most reliably distinguishing early stage OPSCCs from controls. P16 was used as a surrogate marker for HPV. P16-positive and -negative tumours were also analysed separately.  With two or more unique proteins per identification, 176 proteins were quantified. A clear separation between patients with early-stage tumours and controls was seen in principal component analysis. Latent structures discriminant analysis identified 96 proteins most reliably differentiating OPSCC patients from controls, with 13 upregulated and 83 downregulated in study cases. The set of proteins was studied further with network, pathway and protein-protein interaction analyses, and found to participate in e.g. lipid metabolism.  We identified patients with early stage OPSCC from controls based on their serum proteome, and suggest a protein set for further evaluation as a diagnostic biomarker panel for OPSCC.

We previously showed that naturally occurring peptides of collagen type I were elevated in the urine of patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). CRLM tissue was compared to healthy adjacent liver tissue (controls) using high resolution mass spectrometry. Twenty-two different collagen alpha chains were identified, 19 of which were significantly upregulated (P<0.05) in CRLM tissue compared with control tissue. We observed expression of four collagen alpha chains which were absent or low expressed in healthy colon and control tissue, but were highly present in CRC and CRLM tissues analyzed. This expression pattern was also observed for six non-collagen colon specific proteins. Two of these proteins (CDH17 and PPP1R1B/DARP-32) were not known to be differently expressed in CRLM in comparison to healthy liver tissue. Furthermore, 16 of 20 identified proteins related to collagen synthesis were upregulated, indicating increased synthesis of collagen in CRLM. Cross-validation of the mass spectrometry data with immunohistochemistry for collagen type XII confirmed the significant upregulation of collagen type XII in CRLM. This study shows that the majority of collagen types are upregulated in CRLM compared to control tissue most likely as a result of an increased collagen turnover and changes in the collagen supramolecular structure. This research provides further understanding of morphologic changes in extracellular matrix of CRLM and the finding of proteins and peptides that might be specific for tumor metastasis in liquid biopsies.

Although epidemiological studies showing adverse effects such as oxidative stress-induced aging exists, studies showing the cellular and molecular response to such stress are rare. Using a primary skin keratinocyte model and TMT-based quantitative proteomics strategy, we studied the effects of chronic exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPE) and DPE vapor on the cellular proteome and the ability of a known anti-oxidant Vitamin E in ameliorating such changes. LC-MS3 analysis of DPE and/or its vapor exposed skin keratinocytes resulted in quantification of 4,490 proteins of which 201 and 374 proteins were significantly dysregulated (≥1.5 fold, p-value ≥0.05) in each condition, respectively. We observed distinct molecular alterations in chronic DPE and DPE vapor exposure models.

Proteins circulating in blood are a preferred source of biomarkers for a wide range of cancers due to the ease and non-invasiveness of collection. Our approach to cancer biomarker discovery is based on the observation that proteomic changes in tumor tissue are remotely detectable as changes in the protein composition of blood plasma. To determine whether these changes in the plasma of patients are specific for their specific cancer or represent a response to cancer in general we performed a cross-tumor plasma proteomic study. Using a proteomic serum/plasma workflow consisting of the combined use of N-glycosite enrichment and SWATH mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS), we investigated 155 blood samples derived from cohorts of patients with carcinomas at a localized or locally advanced clinical stage, or from a matched control group. A quantitative comparison of the resulting N-glycosite profiles indicated that some biomarkers are common to several cancers, while others are highly specific for one cancer type.

The raw p-value < 0.05 and fold change (FC) between Carcinoma and Controls > 1.2 were used as criteria to recognize significant changes of blood glycoproteins (Table 1). These proteins were used as the input for further analyses including machine learning, logistic regression analysis and data stratifications.	2017-05-04

Among these strategies, bacteria induce transcriptional changes, in order to modify the set of proteins synthetized by the host cell, or target pre-existing proteins by modulating their post-translational modifications or by triggering their degradation. Protein levels variations in host cells during infection integrates both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations induced by pathogens. Here, we focused on host proteome alterations induced by the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and more specifically the Listeria toxin Listeriolysin O (LLO).  In order to characterize host proteome alterations induced by LLO, we performed a shotgun proteomics analysis on HeLa cells treated or not with the LLO toxin. To this end, we used SILAC labelling (stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture) to compared in a quantitative manner the protein content from two differentially treated cell populations: one control population and one population incubated with a sublytic dose of LLO (3 nM). We decided to expose cells to LLO during only 20 min to limit protein level changes resulting from transcriptional changes. We performed two independent experiments (experiment #1 and experiment #2) with swapped SILAC labelling to rule out putative labelling-dependent effects. A total of 2009 and 2577 proteins was quantified in each independent experiment, respectively, and 1834 proteins were quantified in both experiments. Among these 1834 proteins, we identified a total of 151 proteins for which protein levels were consistently decreased in cells treated with LLO (i.e. with a log2 control/LLO ratio >0.5 in both experiments). To assess whether the host proteasome was involved in the decrease of these 151 proteins, we repeated our proteomics analysis on SILAC-labelled HeLa cells pre-treated with proteasome inhibitors before exposure to LLO. Two independent experiments were similarly performed with swapped SILAC labelling (experiment #3 and experiment #4). Interestingly, we observed that the vast majority of host proteins identified as strongly downregulated in response to LLO also displayed significant decreased levels in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that the majority of observed decreases in host protein levels induced by LLO are not due to proteasome-mediated degradation. In follow-up experiments, we validated that LLO decreases in particular the protein level of two E2 ubiquitin enzymes, UBE2K and UBE2N, leading to major changes in the host ubiquitylome. This toxin-induced proteome remodeling involves post-transcriptional regulations, as no modification in the transcription levels of the corresponding genes was observed. These decreases in host protein levels were observed in different epithelial cell lines but not in macrophages. In addition, we could show that Perfringolysin O, another bacterial pore-forming toxin similar to LLO, also induces host proteome changes. Taken together, our data show that different bacterial pore-forming toxins induce deep proteome remodeling, that may impair host epithelial cell functions.

Protease activity is tightly regulated by control of gene expression, compartmentalisation of enzyme and substrate, zymogen activation, enzyme inactivation, and substrate availability. Emerging evidence suggests that proteolysis can also be regulated by substrate glycosylation and that glycosylation of individual sites on a substrate can decrease, or in rare cases, increase its sensitivity to proteolysis. In the present study we investigated the relationship between site-specific O-glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage of extracellular proteins. By in silico analysis we found a significant association between O-glycosylation sites and cleavage sites. We then used a positional proteomic strategy, Terminal Amine Isotopic Labelling of Substrates (TAILS) to map in vivo cleavage sites in HepG2 cells with and without one of the key initiating GalNAc-transferases, GalNAc-T2. To reduce complexity, the comparison were performed in so-called SimpleCells. In these cells the Core 1 β3-galactosyltransferase-specific molecular chaperone (COSMC; C1GALT1C1) has been knocked out, resulting in global truncation of O-glycans leaving only the initial GalNAc. Surprisingly, we found that loss of GalNAc-T2 resulted in not only an increase in cleavage, but also a decrease in cleavage across a broad range of other substrates, including key regulators of the protease network. GALNT2 has previously been identified as a candidate gene for dyslipidaemia and has been shown to specifically glycosylate central regulators of lipid homeostasis, here we find altered processing of several of these regulators including Apolipoproteins B (ApoB) and the Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), providing new clues to the link between GALNT2 and lipid homeostasis. In contrast to the findings from the majority of previous studies, these results indicate that O-glycosylation can both decrease and increase substrate cleavage. We challenged this system with exogenous matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and neutrophil elastase and observed substantial changes to the neutrophil elastase N-terminome, but no evidence for a similar role for MMP9. Overall, we show that loss of O-glycosylation leads to a general decrease in cleavage, that GalNAc-T2 O-glycosylation affects key regulators of the cellular proteolytic network, including multiple members of the Serpin family.

Raw data were analysed using Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer 2.1 software and searched against the UniProt KB/SwissProt-reviewed database downloaded on July 8, 2010, containing 20,212 entries. An additional fasta file containing contaminants obtained from a common repository at the Max Planck Institute was included in the search: (http://www.matrixscience.com/help/ seq_db_setup_contaminants.html). HCD data were searched using the SEQUEST HT node in PD 2.1. In all cases, the precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion mass tolerance to 50 millimass units. Carbamidomethylation (+57.021 Da) of cysteine and dimethyl labelling (light: +28.031 Da, heavy: +34.069 Da) of lysine were set as static modifications. Dimethylation of the protein N termini, acetylation of protein N termini (+42.011), formation of pyroglutamate on peptide N termini (+17.027) and methionine oxidation (+15.996Da) were considered dynamic modifications. The search was conducted using semi-specific trypsin cleavage with up to two missed cleavages. All spectra were searched against non-decoy and decoy databases to allow calculation of the false discovery rate. Afterwards, percolator was used to calculate the local false discovery rate and a threshold FDR of 1% was applied at the peptide level. Data were subsequently analysed R. The technical variance was measured by comparison of two identical non-treated samples (Figure 3). The samples were differentially labelled and compared using TAILS; in the ideal scenario, quantitation of the two fractions should result in a heavy:light ratio of 1.0 for all quantified N-termini peptides. A deviation from this ratio represents the technical error associated with TAILS enrichment and quantitation by LC23 MS/MS. From this analysis 98% of peptides were quantified with a less than 2-fold change (H:L ratio range log(2) -0.73 to 0.21) indicating good technical replication. Subsequently, internal tryptic peptide dimethyl ratios were combined by sample type and used to define significant outlier cut-offs by box-and-whisker plot analysis using the BoxPlotR72 tool as previously described73 (coefficient = 1). Final log(2) upper and lower threshold values were 1.52 and -1.69 respectively. These results are in agreement with previously reported lower limits of detection for dimethyl quantitation and TAILS experiments.11,74 Peptide Maps. Data for proteins containing quantified N-termini were subsequently mapped onto protein schematics using R to produce a peptide map summarising total quantitation from all experiments. These barcodes provide a visual method for assessing the changes detected in each treatment group. Two separate analyses were performed to obtain these data: as MMP9 and neutrophil elastase specific effects were only a small portion of the total dataset, the analysis was repeated by combining all experimental groups to generate treatment-independent quantification. These data are represented by the ‘shotgun’ and ‘all’ rows in the peptide map. Substrate winnowing. Correctly mapped peptides designated as outliers were subjected to a substrate winnowing process to separately identify protease dependent and independent targets. Only peptides identified in ≥ 2 spectra were considered and peptides identified with variable N-termini forms (for example a peptide identified with both an N-terminal dimethyl and N-terminal pyroglutamate label in the same sample) were excluded due to the uncertainty in quantitation of these species. Protease independent targets were defined as outlier peptides identified across multiple treatment groups, whereas protease dependent targets were defined as high-confidence targets uniquely identified in that treatment group. Peptides quantified only in one channel were only accepted for further consideration if they were identified by ≥ 2 high quality spectra. Such peptides were deemed singlets and assigned a ratio of 1:50 based on the channel in which they were identified. Of the remaining peptides ~50% of treatment-independent and 65% of treatment dependent (MMP9 or neutrophil elastase) substrates were known O-glycoproteins. Substrates passing these quality checks are listed in the candidate peptides tables in the main text. GO term analysis of protease substrates was performed using the DAVID75, GOrilla76 and REVIGO77 tools. Network effects were assessed with STRING.78 All analysis was performed using unchanged proteins identified in HepG2 cells during TAILS as the reference dataset.	2018-04-10	"[[""DOI:10.1074/jbc.ra118.001978"",""PMID:29593093""]]"

Large-scale proteomic profiling studies of these lesions are also non-existent.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate proteomic changes between normal epidermis, AK, BD and cSCC that could support a molecular classification and improve our understanding of disease progression.  METHODS: Microdissected formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples of normal epidermis (n = 4, pooled), AK (n = 10), BD (n = 10) and cSCC (n = 10) were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Following normalization and multiple testing adjustments, differential abundance analysis was performed using Linear Models for Microarray data. Proteins were filtered for significance (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05) and fold change of at least ±1.5. Comparative bioinformatics analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Proteomic findings were subsequently substantiated using immunohistochemistry.  RESULTS: 2073 unique proteins were identified. cSCC had the highest number of differentially abundant proteins (63 proteins) followed by BD (58 proteins) and AK (46 proteins). Six proteins (APOA1, ALB, SERPINA1, HLA-B, HP and TXNDC5) were differentially abundant in cSCC compared to AK. Immunohistochemical analysis corroborated changes in MIF, RPL37A and TXNDC5. IPA analysis predicted that cell proliferation, angiogenesis and inflammatory reactions were significantly activated in cSCC compared to BD and AK. Cell death and DNA damage were predicted to be inhibited in BD.  CONCLUSION: Our study supports the concept that AK and BD are precursors of cSCC. The identification of proteome changes indicates disruption of repair, pro-apoptotic, and tumor promoting pathways. Our findings will help select targets for classification and treatment.

Enlarged white adipose tissue (WAT) is a feature of obesity and leads to changes in its paracrine and endocrine function. Dysfunction of WAT cells is associated with obesity associated disorders like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Resveratrol (RSV) a natural polyphenolic compound mimics beneficial effects of calorie restriction. As such, RSV seems a promising therapeutic target for obesity-associated disorders. The effect of RSV on the human adipokine profile is still elusive. Therefore, a proteomic study together with bioinformatical analysis was performed to investigate the effect of RSV on the secretion profile of mature human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes. RSV incubation resulted in elevated basal glycerol release and reduced intracellular TG content. This increased intracellular lipolysis was accompanied by profound changes in the adipocyte secretion profile. Extracellular matrix proteins were down-regulated while processing proteins were mostly up-regulated after RSV treatment. Interestingly, RSV induced secretion of proteins protective against cellular stress and proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, we found a RSV-induced up-regulation of adiponectin and ApoE accompanied by a down-regulation of PAI-1 and PEDF secretion which may improve anti-inflammatory processes and increased insulin sensitivity. These effects are beneficial to alleviate obesity-induced metabolic complications. In addition, two novel RSV-regulated adipocyte-secreted proteins were identified.

The identification of specific biomarkers is required to facilitate diagnosis and therapy of dry AMD. We thus measured the proteome of 34 vitreous humor samples (dry AMD: n = 6, nAMD: n = 10, PDR: n = 9, ERM: n = 9). Samples were immunodepleted for high abundant blood proteins and analyzed by LC-MS/MS with a shotgun approach. Data from dry AMD, nAMD and PDR were compared to the ERM patient group, which was used as reference group. A bioinformatic pipeline was used for label-free relative quantification of proteins and to perform cluster analysis, gene ontology classification and gene set enrichment analysis. A selection of differentially regulated proteins was validated by ELISA.  A total of 677 proteins were identified and relatively quantified in the four patient groups. Different clusters of regulated proteins for each patient group were identified and showed characteristic enrichment of specific pathways, like ‘oxidative stress’ for dry AMD, ‘focal adhesion’ for nAMD and ‘complement and coagulation cascade’ for PDR patients. We’ve identified CHLE to be specifically upregulated in dry AMD and RNAS1 together with CPVL to be upregulated in both forms of AMD. The description of pathways specific for the different patient groups and the identification of differentially regulated proteins provide a first step towards the definition of biomarkers for dry AMD. To validate these data and to unravel the mechanistic connection of identified proteins to dry AMD, larger patient cohorts need to be investigated.

Herein, we describe a novel, integrated approach that addresses this knowledge gap. This utilizes mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics to characterize the global impact of an oncogene on the expressed kinome, and then functionally annotates the regulated kinases. As an example, we identified approximately one hundred protein kinases exhibiting altered expression and/or phosphorylation in Src-transformed mammary epithelial cells. Screening with corresponding siRNAs identified nine kinases, including SGK1, as being essential for Src-induced transformation. In contrast, MAP4K5 suppressed transformation in a manner enhanced by S335 phosphorylation. In triple negative breast cancer cells, Src positively regulated SGK1 expression and combined inhibition of Src and SGK1 was more effective at inhibiting cell proliferation than either treatment alone. Therefore, this approach not only provides major mechanistic insights into oncogenic transformation but also aids the design of improved therapeutic strategies.

ROs and chRCCs show pronounced molecular and histological similarities, which renders their differentiation demanding. We aimed for the differential proteome profiling of ROs and chRCCs in order to better understand distinguishing protein patterns.   Methods We employed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples (six RO cases, six chRCC cases) together with isotopic triplex dimethylation and a pooled reference standard to enable cohort-wide quantitative comparison. For lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and integrin alpha-V (ITGAV) we performed corroborative immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an extended cohort of 42 RO cases and 31 chRCC cases lacking any overlap with the smaller proteomic cohort.  Results: At 1 % false discovery rate, we identified > 3900 proteins, of which >2400 proteins were consistently quantified in at least four RO and four chRCC cases. The proteomic expression profiling discriminated ROs and chRCCs and highlighted established features such as accumulation of mitochondrial proteins in ROs together with emphasizing the accumulation of endo-lysosomal proteins in chRCCs. In line with the proteomic data, IHC showed enrichment of LAMP1 in chRCC and of ITGAV in RO.   Conclusion We present one of the first differential proteome profiling studies on ROs and chRCCs and highlight differential abundance of LAMP1 and ITGAV in these renal tumors.

Methods: Four matched pairs of hGF and hPDLF were cultured.  Prior to confluence, membrane bound and associated proteins from cells of the 4th passage were extracted.  The processed protein samples were identified by digestion with trypsin and sequenced using capillary-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on an Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer.  Scaffold by Proteome Software was used to quantitate and validate protein identifications derived from MS/MS sequencing results.        Results: Four hundred fifty proteins were common to both hGF and hPDLF.  Of the proteins identified, 214 were known membrane bound or associated proteins and 165 proteins were known nuclear associated proteins. Twenty-seven proteins, identified from the 450 proteins, common to both hGF and hPDLF, were detected in statistically significant greater quantities in either hGF or hPDLF.  More specifically, 13 proteins were detected in significantly greater quantities in hGF, while 14 proteins were detected in significantly greater quantities in hPDLF.        Conclusions:  Distinct differences in the cellular protein catalog may reflect the dynamic role and high energy requirements of hGF in extracellular matrix remodeling and response to inflammatory challenge as well as the role of hPDGF in monitoring mechanical stress and maintaining tissue homeostasis during regeneration and remineralization.        Method Details: Sequence information from the MS/MS data was processed by converting the .raw files into a merged file (.mgf) using an in-house program, RAW2MZXML_n_MGF_batch (merge.pl, a Perl script).  Isotope distributions for the precursor ions of the MS/MS spectra were deconvoluted to obtain the charge states and monoisotopic m/z values of the precursor ions during the data conversion. The resulting mgf files were searched using Mascot Daemon by Matrix Science version 2.3.2 (Boston, MA) and the database searched against the full SwissProt database version 2012_06 (536,489 sequences; 190,389,898 residues) or NCBI database version 20120515 (18,099,548 sequences; 6,208,559,787 residues The mass accuracy of the precursor ions were set to 20ppm, accidental pick of 13C peaks was also included into the search. The fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.5 Da.  Considered variable modifications were oxidation (Met), deamidation (N and Q) and carbamidomethylation (Cys). Four missed cleavages for the enzyme were permitted.  A decoy database was also searched to determine the false discovery rate (FDR) and peptides were filtered according to the FDR. The significance threshold was set at p less than 0.05 and bold red peptides is required for valid peptide identification. Proteins with a Mascot score of 50 or higher with a minimum of two unique peptides from one protein having a -b or -y ion sequence tag of five residues or better were accepted. Any modifications or low score peptide/protein identifications were manually checked for validation.         Spectral Counting: Label Free Quantitation was performed using the spectral counting approach. Scaffold (version Scaffold_3.4.9, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (Keller, A et al Anal. Chem. 2002;74(20):5383-92).  Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability and contained at least 1 identified peptides.  Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii, AI Anal Chem. 2003 Sep 1;75(17):4646-58). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.

At least four different subtypes of FTLD-TDP have been described, based on the morphology and neuroanatomical distribution of pathological TDP-43 accumulations. To understand the molecular basis of this heterogeneity that correlates with clinical presentations, we developed SarkoSpin, a new method for the biochemical isolation of pathological TDP-43 from complex tissues. Using postmortem samples of 79 patients and controls, we show that SarkoSpin allows the physical separation of pTDP-43 from ~99.8% of total proteins, including the extreme bulk of physiological TDP-43. Pathological TDP-43 extracted from different disease subtypes forms large and buoyant assemblies of distinct densities and 3-dimentional shapes that correlate with specific neuropathological classifications.

OMICs technologies cannot be applied on clinically precious human material as this is required in its integrity for routine pathology investigation. Hence all OMICs discovery today is done on residual and not clinically relevant material. In the study, we present a novel, non-destructive, procedure named EXPEL, which uses rapid, pressure-assisted, interstitial fluid extrusion, allowing for full clinical pathology and OMICs analysis (proteins, metabolites, miRNA and DNA) on the same specimen. To demonstrate this we engage in a simultaneous biomarker discovery and routine diagnostic analysis of human colorectal cancer and liver metastases. Biomarkers discovered with EXPEL methodology can be readily detected in human sera, allowing for unprecedented translation to the clinic. EXPEL method enables for the first time both clinicians and scientist to explore identical, fresh, clinical material regardless of origin and size.

We show that RING1B (RING2, RNF2) and canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) genes are amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer (BC). Moreover, cPRC1 complexes functionally associate with genes regulated by cell type specific key transcription factors such as estrogen receptor (ER) in ER+ tumor cells and BRD4 in triple negative BC cells. cPRC1 is recruited to active enhancers in a manner independent of PRC2 and RING1B enzymatic activity. RING1B regulates enhancer activity and gene transcription not only by promoting the expression of BC oncogenes but also by regulating chromatin accessibility for oncogenic transcription factors. RING1B recruitment, and thus PRC1 association, to active enhancers occurs in multiple cancers.

At a cellular level, this life and death decision is controlled by environmental stimuli including death receptors activation. Here, we show that establishment of cell polarity and AJ formation control the pro-apoptotic signaling emanating from the death receptor Fas. We demonstrate that in colon epithelia Fas concentrates at cell-cell junctions together with the E-cadherin, which protects cells from FasL-induced cell death. The Fas-cadherin association requires the C terminal PDZ binding site of Fas and, using a proteomic approach, we showed that this domain allows the association with the polarity molecule Dlg1. We proved that the interaction of Fas with this scaffold molecule participate to this cell death protection. Therefore inhibition of FasL-induced cell death by Fas-cadherin-Dlg1 complex is a double-edged sword mechanism that helps to maintain epithelial homeostasis by (i) protecting normal polarized epithelia from apoptosis (ii) promoting the elimination of compromised non-polarized cells.

Relative intensity-based label-free quantification (LFQ) was processed using the MaxLFQ algorithm2 from the freely available MaxQuant computational proteomics platform, version 1.5.3.83. The acquired raw LC Orbitrap MS data were first processed using the integrated Andromeda search engine4. Spectra were searched against the human subset of the swisssprot database database (date 2018.01; 20244 entries).The following parameters were used for searches : (i) trypsin allowing cleavage before proline; (ii) two missed cleavages were allowed; (ii) monoisotopic precursor tolerance of 20 ppm in the first search used for recalibration, followed by 4.5 ppm for the main search and 0.5 Da for fragment ions from MS/MS ; (iii) cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.02146) as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation (+15.99491) and N-terminal acetylation (+42.0106) as variable modifications; (iv) a maximum of five modifications per peptide allowed; and (v) minimum peptide length was 7 amino acids and a maximum mass of 4,600 Da. The match between runs option was enabled to transfer identifications across different LC-MS/MS replicates based on their masses and retention time within a match time window of 0.7 min and using an alignment time window of 20min. The quantification was performed using a minimum ratio count of 1 (unique+razor) and the second peptide option to allow identification of two co-fragmented co-eluting peptides with similar masses. The false discovery rate (FDR) at the peptide level and protein level were set to 1% and determined by searching a reverse database. For protein grouping, all proteins that cannot be distinguished based on their identified peptides were assembled into a single entry according to the MaxQuant rules. The statistical analysis was done with Perseus program (version 1.5.6.0) from the MaxQuant environment (www.maxquant.org). The LFQ normalised intensities were uploaded from the proteinGroups.txt file. First, proteins marked as contaminant, reverse hits, and “only identified by site” were discarded. Quantifiable proteins were defined as those detected in at least 100% of samples in at least one condition. Protein LFQ intensities were base 2 logarithmized to obtain a normal distribution. Missing values were replaced using data imputation by randomly selecting from a normal distribution centred on the lower edge of the intensity values that simulates signals of low abundant proteins using default parameters (a downshift of 1.8 standard deviation and a width of 0.3 of the original distribution). In this way, imputation of missing values in the controls allows statistical comparison of protein abundances that are present only in the inhibitors samples. To determine whether a given detected protein was specifically differential a two-sample t-test were done using permutation based FDR-controlled at 0.01 and 0.05 and employing 250 permutations.

By monitoring the rate of incorporation of labelled amino acids into newly synthesised proteins as they appear in the media, we can differentiate those proteins that have been destined for secretion, and exhibit rapid labelling, from those with low rates of labelling or low turnover relative to the growth rate of the cells which is a feature of intracellular proteins.

Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation was allowed as a variable modification. The initial precursor and fragment ion maximum mass deviations were set to 20 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. Peptide and protein false discovery rates (FDRs) were set to 1%, the ‘requant’ function activated and ‘match between runs’ enabled with the default parameters. For each peptide which passed a 1% FDR threshold in the Andromeda search, the relative isotope abundance (RIA) was calculated at each time-point if available in the MS data. We applied a set of stringent criteria in order to produce high quality data-sets for each cell-line analysed. First, the RIA data for at least 3 time-points were considered necessary for determination of the labelling trajectory. As the protein content of the secretome increases with time, we only analysed peptides where we had RIA data at both 6 h and 24 h post exchange of DMEM. We only focussed on peptides that had been identified and quantified, allowing RIA calculation, at > 1 time-point in the labelling trajectory, too, so that we were effectively tracking their RIA behaviour over time. Peptides for which we obtained evidence at a single time-point, were rejected, even if they yielded informative RIA data for the kinetic behaviour of the parent protein in the system). Peptides were also rejected from further analysis if they showed impossible behaviour in this experimental system, for example, their calculated RIA 30 min after media exchange was > that after 24 h. To assess changes in the abundance of proteins identified from the 1% FDR Andromeda searches, we summed the peptide intensity reported by MaxQuant of labelled (heavy) and unlabelled (light) features to obtain a surrogate label-free quantification value. All mathematical modelling and data visualisations were carried out using R (v3.5.0) and ggplot2 (v2.0.0).	2019-10-08	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.TIR117.000516"",""PMID:29915148""]]"

We have analyzed sections from FFPE biopsy blocks and identified more than 4500 protein without sample pre-fractionation. We have compared protein expression in two sample cohorts that were chosen retrospectively from patients participating in research protocols at our facility. First we compared biopsies from 10 patients collected at the time of diagnoses (untreated CD) with biopsies collected 1 year later following gluten free diet (treated CD). We observed overall good agreement between differential expression of proteins and histological changes that occur in the intestine. We identified biological pathways that are known to operate in the disease lesion. We also observed a strong signal for neutrophil infiltration. By use of a dedicated immunoglobulin variable gene family database we found that differential expression of IGHV5-51 distinguished our untreated from treated CD patients. We also compared protein expression in 4 treated CD patients that developed histological changes in the small intestine in response to a 3 day gluten challenge. Although these patients develop an intestinal lesion resembling the lesion observed in untreated patients, we observed differential expression of proteins involved in acute tissue remodeling that were not seen when we compared UCD to TCD samples. Our study presents a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that analysis of material from FFPE tissue block material can provide a comprehensive overview of many disease processes that occur in the celiac small intestine.

We have previously reported that lung-derived MSC are tissue-resident cells with lung-specific properties compared to bone marrow-derived MSC. Assessing relevant molecular differences between lung-MSC and bone marrow-MSC is important, given that such differences may impact their behavior and potential therapeutic use. Here, we present an in-depth mass spectrometry (MS) based strategy to investigate the proteomes of lung-MSC and bone marrow-MSC. The MS-strategy relies on label free quantitative data-independent acquisition (DIA) analysis and targeted data analysis using a MSC specific spectral library. We identified several significantly differentially expressed proteins between lung-MSC and bone marrow-MSC within the cell layer (352 proteins) and in the conditioned medium (49 proteins). Bioinformatics analysis revealed differences in regulation of cell proliferation, which was functionally confirmed by decreasing proliferation rate through Cytochrome P450 stimulation. Our study reveals important tissue-specific differences within proteome and matrisome profiles between lung- and bone marrow-derived MSC that may influence their behavior and affect the clinical outcome when used for cell-therapy.

Studies in mice suggest that TEX101 is a cell-surface chaperone which regulates, through protein-protein interactions, the maturation of proteins involved in spermatozoa transit and oocyte binding. Male TEX101-null mice are sterile. Here, we identified by co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry the interactome of human TEX101 in testicular tissues and spermatozoa. The testis-specific cell-surface dipeptidase 3 (DPEP3) emerged as the top hit. We further validated the TEX101-DPEP3 complex by using hybrid immunoassays. Combinations of antibodies recognizing different epitopes of TEX101 and DPEP3 facilitated development of a simple immunoassay to screen for disruptors of TEX101-DPEP3 complex. As a proof-of-a-concept, we demonstrated that anti-TEX101 clone 34ED604 (antibody T4) disrupted the native TEX101-DPEP3 complex. Disrupting antibodies may be used to study the human TEX101-DPEP3 complex, and to develop modulators for male fertility.

Protein search was performed against the non-redundant Human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (HUMAN5640_sProt-012016). Search parameters included: trypsin enzyme specificity, 2 missed cleavages, minimum peptide length of 8 amino acids, minimum of 1 unique peptide, top 8 MS/MS peaks per 100 Da, peptide mass tolerance of 20 ppm for precursor ion and MS/MS tolerance of 0.5 Da, fixed modification of cysteines by carbamidomethylation and variable modification of methionine oxidation and N-terminal protein acetylation. False-discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% both at the protein and the peptide levels. Label-free relative quantification of identified proteins was achieved by the MaxLFQ algorithm integrated into MaxQuant (33). The ‘proteinGroups.txt’ file, generated by MaxQuant, was uploaded to Perseus software (version 1.5.5.3) for further statistical analysis (34). Protein identifications classified as “Only identified by site”, “Reverse”, and “Contaminants” were excluded. LFQ intensities were log2-transformed, and two groups with three replicates each were compared (LFQ-anti-TEX101 and LFQ-mouse IgG). Proteins with less than three valid values in at least one group were filtered out. Missing LFQ values were imputed with values representing a normal distribution to enable statistical analysis. A two-sample t-test (Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate-adjusted p values) was applied to determine proteins statistically enriched by anti-TEX101 versus non-specific mouse IgG. We performed variance correction (s0) for each comparison, and we applied FDR of 1% for candidate selection.	2018-03-19	"[[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.ra118.000749"",""PMID:30097533""]]"

ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a reversible posttranslational modification involved in a range of cellular processes. Here, we report system-wide identification of serine ADPr in human cells upon oxidative stress. High-resolution mass spectrometry and unrestricted data processing confirm that serine residues are the major target of ADPr in HeLa cells. Proteome-wide analysis identifies 3,090 serine ADPr sites, with 97% of acceptor sites modulating more than 2-fold upon oxidative stress, while treatment with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib abrogates this induction. Serine ADPr predominantly targets nuclear proteins, while structural-predictive analyses reveal that serine ADPr preferentially targets disordered protein regions. The identified ADP-ribosylated serines significantly overlap with known phosphorylated serines, and large-scale phosphoproteomics analysis provides evidence for the site-specific crosstalk between serine ADPr and phosphorylation. Collectively, we demonstrate that serine ADPr is a widespread modification and a major nuclear signaling response to oxidative stress, with a regulatory scope comparable to other extensive posttranslational modifications - Part 1, ADP-ribosylation data.

For data dependent analysis, the library of 4783 SOMAmer®s were multiplexed in sets of 8 and used for enrichment of target proteins from cell lysate and conditioned media, as well as human plasma and serum.  A subset of the SOMAmer®s were screened in urine by this global profiling technique as well.  Cell lines were selected from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia for screening by comparing gene expression of the target proteins measured by RNA sequencing across the CCLE.1  Using the criterion of FPKM value greater than 5 for the target protein, the minimum number of cell lines was grown to maximize protein coverage across the SOMAmer® library.  For a given cell line, the presence of at least 8 target proteins with FPKM values greater than 5was required for inclusion.  Approximately 400 target proteins were not covered by this strategy were screened in serum and plasma only.  For enrichment from biological matrices, SOMAmer®s were combined into sets of 8 such that the potential interaction with similar proteins or binding partners was minimized.  Non-specific binding of the SOMAmer®s was assessed in each matrix by using a SOMAmer® generated against the bacterial protein CysH.  Target protein spectral counts in the SOMAmer® enriched samples were compared to the respective CysH control.  A positive hit is defined as target protein detection with a minimum of 2 spectral counts and signal over CysH background greater than 10X (if applicable).

1117	PXD000162	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000162	Hypoxia-induced Changes in the Secretome of Human Preadipocytes and Adipocytes	White adipose tissue (WAT) is involved in energy metabolism by secretion of proteins with endocrine and paracrine effects. Dysregulation of the secretion pattern of obesity-associated enlarged WAT may lead to obesity-related disorders. This dysregulation may be the result of a hypoxic state caused by poorly vascularised WAT. The effect of hypoxia on the secretome of human (pre)adipocytes is largely unkown. Therefore, secretome changes of CoCl2-treated and non-treated human SGBS (pre)adipocytes were studied by using 2DE with bioinformatic analysis. In addition, regulation of protein secretion was analysed by protein turnover experiments. Hypoxia-induced secretome changes were mostly associated with protein down-regulation and extracellular matrix protein dysregulation. The observed up-regulation of collagens in adipocytes may be essential for cell survival while down-regulation of collagens in preadipocytes may indicate a disturbed differentiation process. These hypoxia-induced changes can be seen as WAT dysfunction that may lead to obesity-associated complications. In addition, 9 novel adipocyte secreted proteins were identified from which 6 were regulated by hypoxia.LC ESI-MS/MS and database search: Excised spots were in-gel trypsin digested and ten microliters of the digested was analyzed by LC ESI-MS/MS on a LCQ Classic (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). The trapped sample was separated on the analytical column (Biosphere C18, 5 µm particle diameter, 200 mm L × 0.05 mm i.d.; Nanoseparations, Nieuwkoop, The Netherlands) using a linear gradient from 5 to 60% (v/v) ACN in water containing 100 mM acetic acid in 55 min (100 nL/min). The eluate of the analytical column was nanosprayed from a Teﬂon connected, gold-coated fused silica emitter (5 µm i.d.; NanoSeparations). With respect to LC-ESI-MS/MS, LCQ Xcalibur v2.0 SR2 raw ﬁles and spectra were selected from Proteome Discover1.2 software (Thermo Scientiﬁc) with the following settings: minimal peak count 50; total intensity threshold 4000; and S/N = 6. Peak lists were searched with Sequest v1.2.0.208 and Mascot v2.3.0.1 against EMBL-EBI International Protein Index database for human proteins (version 3.78, 86 702 entries) and using following settings: fragment tolerance, 1.00 Da (monoisotopic); parent tolerance, 3.0 Da (monoisotopic); ﬁxed modiﬁcations, carbamidomethylation of cystein; variable modiﬁcations, oxidation of methionin; max missed cleavages, 2. Search engine results were combined and validated by Scaffold v3.00.07 (Proteome Software, Portland, OR) with minimum peptide and protein probability set to =80%, followed by visual inspection of spectral (annotation) quality and manual curation, eliminating high background spectra and single engine identiﬁcations, evaluating one-hit wonders and ﬁltering out keratins. Mass spectrometry data can be visualized using PRIDE Inspector and Scaffold .sf3 free viewer (https://proteomecommons.org/tool.jsp?i=1009). Maldi-MS and database search: For MALDI-TOF MS 1.5 mL of each peptide mixture and 0.5 mL matrix solution (10 mg/mL CHCA in 50% ACN/0.1% TFA) was spotted automatically onto a 96 well-format target plate. The spots were allowed to air-dry for homogeneous crystallization. Spectra were obtained using a M@LDI-LR mass spectrometer (Waters). The instrument was operated in positive reflector mode. The acquisition mass range was 900–3000 Da. The instrument was calibrated on 6–8 reference masses from a tryptic digest of alcohol dehydrogenase. In addition, a near point lockmass correction for each sample spot was performed using adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18–39 (MH1 2465.199) to achieve maximum mass accuracy. Typically 100 shots were combined and the background was subtracted. A peptide mass list was generated for the subsequent database search. For semi-quantitative labeling measurements, the area of the M15 peak was divided by that of the M peak x100%. A SD was obtained for this isotopomer mass peak ratio by repeating the experiment three times. Significance of differences between ratios was determined by analysis of variance. The peptide mass list was searched with ProteinLynx Global Server (Waters) or the Mascot search engine (http://www.matrixscience.com) against the Swiss-Prot database (http://expasy.ch/sprot) for protein identification. One miss-cleavage was tolerated, carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as an optional modification. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 100 ppm. No restrictions were made on the protein M and the pI. A protein was regarded as identified when it had a significant MASCOT probability score (p<0.05) and at least five peptide mass hits or sequence coverage of at least 30% of the complete protein sequence.

1123	PXD000050	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD000050	The human islet of Langerhans proteome database	Type 2 diabetes is a worldwide disease reaching epidemic dimensions. The rapid progression of the disease urgently calls for both a broader and deeper understanding of its pathophysiology. In line with this statement, the Human Diabetes Proteome Project (HDPP) was officially launched at the 11th HUPO meeting in Boston, 2012. A special session was dedicated to this new initiative, gathering experts in the main topics related to diabetes and its associated complications. Key issues were debated with a focus on how deranged circulating glucose and free fatty acids induce dysfunction. It has been decided that HDPP will therefore focus on studying the early stages of diabetes that lead to abnormal glucose and lipid levels. The initiative will initially focused on islets of Langerhans, insulin-producing cell lines, and blood human samples from diabetes-related cohorts. In subsequent stages HDPP will investigate target tissues in which glucose and lipids could promote protein dysfunctions. Omics-rooted systems approaches enhanced by bioinformatics will be deployed to unravel effects of lipids and glucose triggering diabetes initiation and progression. A first milestone has been defined for the 12th HUPO meeting in Yokohama, 2013: the 1000 diabetes-associated protein (the 1000-HDPP) database, i.e. a freely available internet resource (www.HDPP.info) of more than 1000 proteins with links to their corresponding proteotypic peptides, affinity reagents and protein-specific biological/biomedical information.

Ductus arteriosus closure involves functional and structural remodeling, controlled by many factors. The closure-related human plasma proteins are unknown. Here we for the first time demonstrate six key differential plasma proteins in the human PDA patients using proteomic technology and present a model to illustrate the constriction and closure of ductus arteriosus. We found that permanent closure might be regulated by the proteins related to platelet activation and coagulation cascades, complement mannan-binding-lectin, and other systemic signaling pathways. Our findings indicate that the differential proteins involved in these pathways may play key roles in the non-closure of the ductus arteriosus and may be developed as biomarkers for diagnosis. All those findings may be served as the basis of understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of PDA.

LC-MS/MS analysis resulted in the identification of 4,920 phosphosites corresponding to 2,288 proteins in six HNSCC cell lines compared to a normal oral cell line; OKF6/TERT1. Among the proteins identified, 23 kinases were found to be hyperphosphorylated in all HNSCC cell lines compared to the normal oral cell line.

Here, we investigated the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery on the plasma proteome, hypothesizing that specific proteins or protein patterns may serve as key mediators and markers of the metabolic response. We performed MS-based proteomics on two longitudinal studies encompassing 47 morbidly obese patients, generating quantitative information on more than 1700 proteins. A global correlation matrix incorporating about 200,000 relationships revealed functional connections between proteins and assigned them to physiological processes. The main classes of significantly altered proteins were markers of systemic inflammation and those involved in lipid metabolism, and our data highlight robust correlative and anti-correlative behavior to each other and to clinical parameters. A group of inflammation-related proteins showed distinct inverse relationships to proteins consistently associated with insulin sensitivity.

For deep proteome profiling, multi-dimensional separation strategies and large initial protein amounts are required. Here, we report on an online 2D-LC-MS/MS approach applying strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) in displacement chromatography mode (DCM) as the first dimension of separation. This method enables a comprehensive analysis of proteomes in the low µg-range (5 µg). The first detailed comparison of DCM with conventionally used gradient chromatography mode (GCM) highlights a significantly better separation efficiency with DCM. Especially for peptides with a net-charge state (NCS) of +2, which represents the majority of tryptic peptides in mammalian proteomes, DCM provides a significantly better separation. These peptides were separated over several fractions in DCM, which is not possible to achieve in GCM due to theirs low affinity towards the SCX column. The better separation in DCM results not only in a considerably higher reproducibility (Pearson’s r=0.93), but significantly increases identification rates of both peptides and proteins. For peptides with a low NCS, DCM achieved a 2.6-fold increase in identified peptides. In total, DCM provides a 1.5-fold increase in peptide identifications and a 1.7-fold increase of protein identifications. The number of identified unique peptides per protein and the protein sequence coverages were significantly higher in DCM compared to GCM providing more reliable quantitative results. The higher sequence coverage are of interest for applications such as proteogenomics, where it is important to have high protein sequence coverages to identify single amino acid variants and splice-junction peptides.

Identified proteins resulted from a comparison of GLC1 and GLC1 SCLC cell lines using 2D DIGE. MALDI-TOF-MS analyses were performed on an UltraFlexTM II (Bruker Daltonics) instrument according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The instrument was equipped with a scoutTM MTP MALDI target. The spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode according to the settings given by the manufacturer. For external calibration, a peptide standard (m/z 757.399, 1296.684, 1619.822, 2093.086 and 3147.471) was used. The MALDI-PMF spectra were processed using the FlexAnalysis™ 2.4 software (Bruker Daltonics) and converted in the .xml format. For peak detection, the spectra were subjected to an internal recalibration using 13 different monoisotopic masses from autolysis products of trypsin and fragments of keratins ranging from m/z 842.509 – 2825.406. Following parameters were applied: snap peak detection algorithm, signal to noise threshold of 6, maximal number of peaks 100, quality factor threshold 50 and baseline subtraction TopHat. The generated mass lists were subsequently sent to ProteinScapeTM 1.3 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), triggering database searches using ProFound (Version 2002.03.01, Proteometrics LLC) and MASCOT (Version 2.3.02, Matrix Science, London, UK). The following search parameters were selected: fixed cysteine modification with propionamide, variable modification due to methionine oxidation, one maximal missed cleavage sites in case of incomplete trypsin hydrolysis and no details about 2-DE derived protein mass and pI. Using the Score booster function of ProteinScapeTM the mass lists were recalibrated and background masses removed using a list containing 44 masses occurring in a minimum of 10% of generated peak lists. The database searches were run with a mass tolerance of 40 ppm using UniProt’s human complete proteome set (downloaded on 26.10.2012) containing 68.109 protein entries. The used database is a composite database consisting of the UniProtKB entries and a duplicate of the same database, in which the amino acid sequence of each protein entry was randomly shuffled. Proteins reaching Profound score > 1.5 or Mascot score > 64 were considered as identified. Using these criteria one decoy database entry was found by the search engines indicating high confidence of protein identifications. If several database entries of homologues proteins matched these criteria only the entry with the highest score was reported.

NCK1 and NCK2 are Src-Homology (SH) 2 and 3 domain adaptors that regulate processes requiring a remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton. Evidence from gene inactivation in mouse suggest that NCK1 and NCK2 are functionally redundant, although recent reports support the idea of unique functions for NCK1 and NCK2. We sought to examine this question further by delineating NCK1- and NCK2-specific signalling networks. We used both affinity purification-mass spectrometry and BioID proximity labelling to identify NCK1/2 signalling networks comprised of 98 proteins. Strikingly, we found 30 proteins restricted to NCK1 and 28 proteins specifically associated with NCK2, thus suggesting differences in their function. We report that Nck2-/-, but not Nck1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) are multi-nucleated and display extended protrusions reminiscent of intercellular bridges, which correlate with an extended time spent in cytokinesis as well as a failure of a significant proportion of cells to complete abscission. Our data also show that the midbody of NCK2-deficient cells is not only increased in length, but also altered in composition, as judged by the mislocalization of AURKB, PLK1 and ECT2. Finally, we show that NCK2 function during cytokinesis requires its SH2 domain. Taken together, our data delineate the first high-confidence interactome for NCK1/2 adaptors and highlight a number of proteins specifically associated with either protein. We further demonstrate that contrary to what is generally accepted, NCK1 and NCK2 are not completely redundant, and shed light on a previously uncharacterized function for the NCK2 adaptor protein in cell division.

Absolute mass search restricts the search space to proteins matching the mass of the precursor, whereas in biomarker search, the search space is extended to protein sequence fragments matching the mass of the precursor. The analysis took about two days per dataset when performing absolute mass and biomarker searches in Prosight PC.  Alternatively we created a custom database containing all histone proteins and common protein contaminants found in our samples using the three different separation approaches described here using an approach similar to what has been described by Zhao et al.28 The confined protein list was created from searches using Prosight PC against the complete Human proteome using 1D (RPLC and WCX) and 2DLC-HRMS data allowing for a 5 PTMs and 10 ppm for parent ions and fragment ions matching. The list of proteins identified (reported in section S3 of the supporting information) was used to create a protein database (“histone&contaminants database”) against which extensive searches (allowing up to 15 PTMs) were performed (using both, Prosight PC and Informed Proteomics).  Table 1 lists proteins identified using Prosight PC 4.0 for searches against the confined database allowing for a maximum of 13 modifications and applying UVPD fragmentation settings for top-down MS2 (RAW files were processed using the Xtract algorithm). The analysis was performed in Absolute mass mode with mass tolerance of 10 ppm for precursor and 10 ppm for fragments using the Δm mode (this function allows to identify proteoforms with PTMs not included in the annotated proteoform database). The unmatched spectra were further searched in Biomarker discovery mode, using the same mass tolerance settings. Histone identifications were filtered using the best hit per experiment function and a P<1E-04 cut-off. Analysis of a single dataset with this approach took 2 days on a personal computer with Intel Core i7-3820 CPU processor at 3.6 GHz with 32 GB of RAM. Additionally, we searched all datasets against the “histone&contaminants database” using the Informed-Proteomics workflow29: ProMex for intact mass deconvolution, MSPath-Finder as search engine, and LcMsSpectator as a data visualization tool. The feature maps reported in various figures were obtained using LcMsSpectator. The results reported in Table 2 were generated from ProsightPC using absolute mass searches against the complete human proteome, with mass tolerance of 10 ppm for precursor and 10 ppm for fragments, allowing up to 13 PTMs and filtered using P<1E-04 cut-off and according to C score results	2018-03-01	"[[""DOI:10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00458"",""PMID:30226781""]]"

A Majority of Keratin 8 (K8) functions are governed by its phosphorylation at Serine73 (head domain) and Serine431 (tail domain) residues. Although deregulation of K8 phosphorylation has been associated with progression of different carcinomas, its role in skin SCC and the underlying mechanism is obscured. To understand the molecular basis of K8 phosphorylation mediated regulation of skin SCC progression, we performed TMT-based quantitative phosphoproteomics by expressing K8 wild type, phosphodead and phosphomimetic mutants in K8 deficient A431 cells. Bioinformatic analysis of our phosphoproteomic data showed differential regulation of phosphoproteins associated with migratory, proliferative and invasive potential in these cells. Further validation of protein phosphorylation levels and phenotypic validation of our phosphoproteomic data suggested potential role of K8 site specific phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in neoplastic progression of A431 cells.

To explore potential biomarkers of HBV-ACLF for clinical applications, immuno-depletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach was employed to analyze plasma samples from 20 healthy control people, 20 CHB patients and 20 HBV-ACLF patients, respectively. As a result, a total of 427 proteins were identified and quantified from these samples, and 42 proteins were differentially expressed in HBV-ACLF patients as compared to both CHB patients and healthy controls. According to bioinformatics analysis results, 6 proteins related to immune response (MMR), inflammatory response (OPN, HPX), blood coagulation (ATIII) and lipid metabolism (APO-CII, GP73) were selected as biomarker candidates. Further ELISA analysis confirmed the significant up-regulation of GP73, MMR, OPN and down-regulation of ATIII, HPX, APO-CII in HBV-ACLF plasma samples (p<0.01). Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed high diagnostic value of these candidates in assessing HBV-ACLF. In conclusion, present quantitative proteomic study identified 6 novel HBV-ACLF biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for development of HBV-ACLF biomarker.

This study reports the results obtained for their characterization in our laboratory utilizing integrated top-down and bottom-up HPLC-ESI-MS and MS/MS platform. The family include 11 parent peptides/proteins and more than 6 parent glycosylated proteins. Despite the complexity, on the basis of their primary structure they result the product of the duplication of three repeats and we propose that they can be classified in two main groups, the first including the peptides called P-E, P-Ko, IB-6, Ps-1, Ps-2, P-H, P-F, P-J, and P-D, the second including the peptides called IB-1, II-2 and the glycosylated basic proline-rich proteins codified by PRB3 and PRB4 genes. A third minor hybrid group includes the proteins called IB-8a Con1- and Con1+.  Some of the proteins of the family (IB-1, II-2 and P-J) are almost always detectable in adult human saliva, while the others are expressed with different frequencies according to the phenotype. Various isoforms are detectable in the adult saliva and three of them, until now not reported (P-H S1→A, P-Ko P36→S, P-Ko A41→S), were characterized by MS/MS fragmentation.

1160	PXD006215	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD006215	The Behçet’s Disease associated Hap10 variant of ERAP1 generates a low affinity HLA-B*51 peptidome through differential processing of two subpeptidomes	HLA-B*51, the main risk factor for Behçet’s disease (BD), binds two main subpeptidomes consisting of low affinity peptides with Ala as their second amino acid and higher affinity peptides with Pro at this position. A low activity variant of ERAP1, Hap10, is uniquely associated with BD susceptibility in epistasis with HLA-B*51. The peptidome presented by HLA-B*51:08 in a cell line expressing Hap10 was compared with the HLA-B*51:01 peptidome from a cell line expressing higher activity variants of ERAP1. The differences due to ERAP1 could be clearly distinguished from those due to subtype polymorphism. The latter should not affect disease susceptibility, since both HLA-B*51 subtypes are associated with BD. In the lower activity, BD-associated, ERAP1 context longer peptides were generated, the Pro2 subpeptidome was significantly reduced, and the Ala2 subpeptidome was correspondingly increased and showed a higher frequency of ERAP1-susceptible P1 residues. These effects are readily explained by the low activity of the disease-associated Hap10 variant, and together resulted in a significantly altered HLA-B*51 peptidome of lower affinity. The differences between both B*51 subtypes affected residue usage at various internal positions of the peptide ligands, including P3, where B*51:01 showed preference for aromatic residues whereas B*51:08 preferred smaller and polar ones. The profound effects of the BD-associated Hap10 haplotype on the nature and affinity of HLA-B*51/peptide complexes could significantly alter T-cell and NK cell recognition, providing a basis for the joint association of ERAP1 and HLA-B*51 to BD.

TEX101 was suggested to function as a cell surface chaperone of numerous proteins involved in sperm migration and sperm-egg interaction. However, the precise functional roles of human TEX101 in spermatogenesis and fertilization are unknown.  Here, we show that a common homozygous variant rs35033974 of TEX101 (G99V) with ~1% frequency in the general population may be associated with idiopathic male infertility. Spermatozoa from patients with homozygous rs35033974 exhibited near-complete degradation of variant G99V TEX101 protein and concomitant degradation of its interactome, as revealed by proteomic measurements. Substantially reduced levels of numerous testis-specific membrane proteins involved in sperm migration and sperm-oocyte fusion (including LY6K, IZUMO3 and ADAM29) were confirmed in spermatozoa of men with homozygous G99V variant. These men were previously diagnosed with idiopathic male infertility or oligospermia and failed the treatment by intrauterine insemination. Collectively, these data may facilitate diagnostics of idiopathic male infertility, provides a rational for selection of male infertility treatments and validate TEX101 and its interactome as targets to develop non-hormonal male contraceptives.

Until now, research mainly focused on differences in core ribosomal proteins and associated factors. The impact of posttranslational modifications has not yet been studied systematically. Analyzing ribosome heterogeneity is challenging since individual proteins can be part of different subcomplexes (40S, 60S, 80S and polysomes). Here, we develop polysome proteome profiling (3P) to obtain unbiased proteomic maps across ribosomal subcomplexes. 3P combines extensive fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation with quantitative mass spectrometry. The high resolution of the profiles allows us to assign proteins to specific subcomplexes. Phosphoproteomics on 3P fractions reveals that phosphorylation of serine 38 in RPL12 -- a known mitotic CDK1 substrate -- is strongly depleted in polysomes. Follow-up experiments confirm that RPL12 phosphorylation regulates translation of specific subsets of mRNAs during mitosis. Together, our results show that posttranslational modification of ribosomal proteins can regulate translation.

Here we present an ultra-tolerant Sequest database search that allowed peptide matching even with modifications of unknown masses up to ±500 Da. From an HEK293 cell proteome-wide dataset (9,513 proteins and 396,736 peptides), a ±500-Da search matched an additional 184,000 modified peptides. These were linked to both biological and chemical modifications representing 523 distinct mass bins including phosphorylation, glycosylation, and methylation.  We attempted to localize all unknown modification masses to specific regions within a peptide, and known modifications were accurately assigned to the correct amino acids with frequencies often >90%.  These data demonstrate that a large fraction of previously unassignable spectra are assignable to peptide sequences with modifications.

Erroneous charge state and monoisotopic m/z values were corrected as per previous publication 22. MS/MS spectra assignments were made with the Sequest algorithm 3  using indexed Ensembl databases (Mouse: Mus_musculus NCBIM37.61, Human: Homo_sapiens GRCh37.61). Databases were prepared with forward and reversed sequences concatenated according to the target-decoy strategy 41.  All searches were performed using a static modification for cysteine alkylation (57.02146 Da).   Closed Searches.  Closed searches were performed with Sequest (Rev28) using indexed databases with a precursor ion tolerance of 5 ppm.  The fragment ion tolerance was set very narrow (0.01 Da).  Specificity was set based on the protease used (trypsin for HEK293 studies and Lys-C for mouse studies) and allowing 1 missed cleavage.  Oxidized methionine was considered dynamically (+15.994915 Da).  Sequest matches were filtered by linear discriminant analysis as described previously 22  to a dataset level error of 1% FDR at the protein level (~0.2% peptide level) based on matches to reversed sequences 41.  Open Searches.  Open searches were performed with Sequest exactly as for Closed searches with the following changes.  The precursor ion tolerance was set to 500 Da unless otherwise specified.  The GUI (graphical user interface) in Proteome Discoverer 2.0 (soon to be released) will allow Open searches to be conducted.  Oxidized methionine was not considered as a dynamic modification.  Post-search filtering via linear discriminant analysis did not use mass accuracy (ppm) as a feature for differentiating true and false positives.  These searches often considered more than 1000 fold greater peptide search spaces.  However, the time penalty for this increase does not scale linearly for Sequest and was ~10 fold.  Open searches for each 3-hr analysis considered on average 44,390 MS/MS spectra and finished in less than two hours on a standard 6-core CPU with 6MB RAM.  Note that using the pre-indexed database option is essential to achieving reasonable search times.   Guassian fit analysis Mass shifts were clustered using Gaussian mixture models using the mclust package for R Core 52-54. Mass shifts were binned in to 1 Da windows bounded at each half Da point. Within each bin, the number of mass shifts annotated in UniMod 55  falling within that bin were used to set the maximum number of Gaussian mixtures in the model, and the mixture models allowing for variable mixture variances were fitted within that window. An optimal number of mixture components was calculated by the software using BIC, and the model for that number of components was used. Fitted mixture components with a variance greater than 0.01 were then removed from the data set.  Ascore The Ascore algorithm 40  uses the cumulative binomial probability distribution to provide a localization score for a mass difference (phosphorylation, +79.9663) to a serine, threonine, or tyrosine.  We modified the Ascore algorithm to allow for the localization of any modification mass to any potential site within the peptide.  Because sufficient information was not always present to localize to a specific site, scores were calculated for individual sites as well as regions.  An Ascore value of >20 (p<0.01) was used as a threshold significance value for assigning modifications to an amino acid or region within a peptide. Supplementary table 2 contains the Ascore, Ascore sequence (potential location of modification), Ascore region (amino acids in which the score is identical) and the number of amino acids considered in the region. In addition, a modification could not be localized if the number of ions matched for a peptide does not increase when the modification is considered throughout the sequence.	2014-11-06	"[[""DOI:10.1038/nbt.3267"",""PMID:26076430""]]"

However, due to technical difficulties involved in their assembly and analysis, the role of repeats in tumor evolution is poorly understood. We developed a rigorous motif-based methodology to quantify variations in the repeat content of proteomes and genomes, directly from proteomic and genomic raw sequence data, and applied it to analyze a wide range of tumors and normal tissues. We identify high similarity between the repeat-instability in tumors and their patient-matched normal tissues, but also tumor-specific signatures, both in protein expression and in the genome, that strongly correlate with cancer progression and robustly predict the tumorigenic state. In a patient, the hierarchy of genomic repeat instability signatures accurately reconstructs tumor evolution, with primary tumors differentiated from metastases. We find an inverse relationship between repeat-instability and point mutation load, within and across patients, and independently of other somatic aberrations. Thus, repeat-instability is a distinct, transient and compensatory adaptive mechanism in tumor evolution.

Endosomes undergo a process of maturation which specifies whether material will be shuttled back to the cell surface or degraded by the lysosome. Nevertheless, a complete inventory of factors regulating endosomal maturation is still lacking. Recently, membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endosomes have emerged as important players in endosomal sorting, dynamics and motility. Here, we identify the ER transmembrane protein PDZD8 as a new Rab7 effector that, together with the MCS component Protrudin, forms an ER-late endosome MCS. At these ER-late endosome MCSs, PDZD8 also recruits mitochondria to form a three-way contact. Our data suggest that the PDZD8/Protrudin-Rab7 MCS functions to facilitate an early stage of late endosome maturation.

However, the mechanisms underlying histone degradation remain elusive. When compared with their differentiated counterparts, immortal human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have a unique chromatin architecture and low levels of trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), a heterochromatin-associated modification. Here we assess a link between the intrinsic epigenetic landscape and ubiquitin-proteasome system of hESCs. We find that hESCs exhibit high expression of UBE2K, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Loss of UBE2K increases the levels of H3K9 trimethyltransferase SETDB1, resulting in H3K9 trimethylation and repression of neurogenic genes during differentiation. Concomitantly, loss of UBE2K impairs the ability of hESCs to differentiate into neural progenitors with neurogenic properties. Besides H3K9 trimethylation, we find that UBE2K binds histone H3 to induce its polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Notably, ubc-20, the worm orthologue of UBE2K, also regulates both histone H3 levels and H3K9 trimethylation in C. elegans germline. Thus, our results indicate that UBE2K crosses evolutionary boundaries to promote histone H3 degradation and reduce H3K9me3 repressive marks in immortal cells.

Additionally, serious side effects may  cause medication drop-out, aggravated by a lack of understanding about how  these drugs act at molecular level. As proteomics is a suitable tool for  studying multifactorial disorders, the main goal was to unravel signaling  pathways in blood plasma associated with a positive treatment outcome for the  atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone. Blood plasma was collected  from schizophrenia patients six weeks after treatment (T6), and patients were  classified as good or poor responders to olanzapine or risperidone, and then  samples were compared to each patient's baseline (T0). All samples were  analyzed using label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics. Samples were  depleted of the 14 most abundant proteins in plasma, were digested, and then  submitted to M-Class two-dimensional nano-liquid chromatography, coupled online  to a Synapt G2-Si mass spectrometer. Data was obtained in MSE mode (data- independent acquisition) in combination with ion-mobility (HDMSE). The proteins  found to be differentially abundant in good responders compared to poor  responders for risperidone and olanzapine were functionally analyzed in silico  using Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis and were found to be mostly involved with  immune system functions. This data can contribute to better understand the  biochemical signaling peripherally triggered by antipsychotic medication, and  can eventually be used to help improve treatment outcome by predicting patient  response as well as through the development of new medication or a combination  of drugs that act on the immune system to reduce the duration of poor response  periods in patients suffering with schizophrenia.

Our study population included two cohorts for the discovery (N = 30) and validation (N = 30) of differentially excreted proteins. Of the 2451 proteins identified, 576 were quantified in all samples from the discovery cohort, and 34 comprised the urinary signature for early type 1 diabetes after Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment (Q < 0.05). The top pathways associated with this signature included lysosome, glycosaminoglycan degradation, and innate immune system (Q < 0.01).

However, limited data is available regarding the MB tumor microenvironment. Here we present a mass spectrometry-based multi-omics study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from recurrent MB patients. A group of age-matched patients without a neoplastic disease was used as control cohort. Proteome profiling identified several characteristic tumor markers and revealed a strong prevalence of anti-inflammatory and tumor-promoting proteins characteristic for alternatively polarized myeloid cells in MB samples. The up-regulation of ADAMTS1, GAP43 and GPR37 indicated hypoxia in CSF of MB patients. This notion was independently supported by metabolomics, demonstrating up-regulation of tryptophan, methionine, serine and lysine, all of which have been described to be induced upon hypoxia in CSF. The beta-oxidation promoting lipid hormone 12,13-DiHOME was found strongly upregulated, potentially promoting a metabolic shift supporting drug resistance and stem cell properties of MB cells.

The protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is the major enzyme responsible for generating monomethyl- and symmetric dimethyl arginine (MMA and SDMA, respectively) in proteins. PRMT5 is essential for viability and normal development, and overexpressed in a wide variety of cancer types. In the present study, we found that the levels of PRMT5 and symmetric dimethylation in proteins from colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues are more highly maintained relative to adjacent normal tissues from patients. Using immunoaffinity enrichment of methylated peptides combined with high resolution mass spectrometry, a total of 147 SDMA sites from 94 proteins were identified. Most abundant methylated proteins identified from normal and CRC tissues are RNA processing proteins, transcriptional and translational regulators. Furthermore, when quantitative analysis of the two tissue types of samples was carried out, 77 SDMA sites exhibited statistically significant changes (>2.0-fold, p-value <0.05) between normal and CRC tissues. We confirmed KSRP, G3BP2 and TRIP6 which are more highly maintained in cancer tissues relative to adjacent normal tissues from same patients as well as the expression levels of the proteins. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of symmetric arginine dimethylation using clinical samples and suggests that the modification can be used in clinical application.

A mass accuracy of +/-5 ppm was used for precursor ions and 1.0 Da for product ions. Enzyme specificity was limited to trypsin, with at least one tryptic (K- or R-containing) terminus required per peptide and up to four mis-cleavages allowed. Cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.02146374) was specified as a static modification, oxidation of methionine (+15.9949146221) and methylation (+14.0156500642 for monomethyl and +28.0313001284 for dimethyl) on arginine residues were allowed as variable modifications. Reversed decoy databases were included for all searches to estimate false discovery rates and filtered using a 5% FDR in the Linear Discriminant module of Core. Peptides were also manually filtered using a +/-5ppm mass error range and presence of a methylated arginine residue. Sites of arginine methylation were determined using a slight variation on the Ascore algorithm [17], with sites scoring >13 considered confidently assigned.      All quantitative results were generated using Progenesis (Nonlinear Dynamics) and Skyline (MacLean) to extract the integrated peak area of the corresponding peptide assignments. The intensity of identified peptides was represented by the peak area of the extracted ion chromatogram of their monoisotopic peaks. The peptide with the highest intensity was picked to represent one methylation site of a protein when multiple peptides were identified for the same methylation site. For statistical analysis, the peptide peak intensity values were first log-transformed followed by Student’s t-test comparison of the log2(peptide peak intensity) values obtained from the two LC-MS/MS replicates of the peptides containing methylarginine from each type of sample.  Heat maps of the quantitative data were generated and clustered in Perseus software (version 1.6.1.1, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry).	2019-10-01	"[[""DOI:10.1002/pmic.201900367"",""PMID:32468700""]]"

However, its use in quantifying acute changes has been limited due the low labeled peptide stoichiometry. Here, we describe the use of instrument logic to select peaks of interest via targeted mass differences (TMD) for overcoming this limitation. Comparing peptides artificially mixed at low heavy-to-light stoichiometry measured using standard data dependent acquisition with or without TMD revealed 2-3 fold increases in identification without significant loss in quantification precision for both MS2 and MS3 methods. Our benchmarked method approach increases throughput by reducing the necessary machine time. We anticipate that all pulsed SILAC measurements, if combined with TMT or not, would greatly benefit from instrument logic based approaches.

Assessing the specificity of anntibodies, or any protein binder, is essential for the development of a protein biomarker assay. In addition to antibodies, novel protein binders like affimers are developed with a high specificity against the target protein and without batch-to-batch variability. In this study, we compared the specificity of affimers and commercially available antibodies against two non-related proteins (IL-37 and proinsulin).   We conducted protein capture experiments with antibodies coupled to magnetic protein G beads and (biotinylated) affimers coupled to streptavidin magnetic beads. Binding capacity of anti-IL-37 and anti-proinsulin antibodies and affimers was investigated via these magnetic-bead captures of their recombinant protein targets in human plasma.   The purified fractions were transferred to an SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel digestion of the visualized protein bands and subsequently analyzed with western blot or shotgun proteomics using LC-MS/MS. From the proteomics experiments we evaluated the amount of background proteins that were co-purified during the protein purification procedure. In addition we determined the relative abundance of the target protein relative to other non-related proteins.

We conducted a stringent affinity-purification mass-spectrometry-based screen of the physical interactions of human RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligases. The resulting protein-interaction network revealed interactions between the RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase MKRN2 and GLE1, a DEAD-box helicase activator implicated in mRNA export termination. We assessed MKRN2 epistasis with GLE1 in a genetically tractable zebrafish model. Morpholino-mediated knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout of MKRN2 partially rescued retinal developmental defects seen upon GLE1 depletion, consistent with a functional association between GLE1 and MKRN2. Using ribonomic approaches, we showed that MKRN2 binds selectively to the 3'UTR of a diverse subset of mRNAs and that nuclear export of MKRN2-associated mRNAs is enhanced upon knockdown of MKRN2. Taken together, we suggest that MKRN2 interacts with GLE1 to selectively regulate mRNA nuclear export and retinal development.

This process does not depend on the presence of accessible or useable DNA in a sample. This makes proteomic genotyping an attractive alternative for analysis of problematic forensic samples, such as hair shafts, degraded bones or teeth, fingermarks, or sexual assault evidence. To demonstrate the concept in hair shafts, we developed an optimized sample processing protocol that could be used with high effectiveness on single hairs. This allows us to determine if the detected profiles of genetically variant peptides are robust and result in a consistent profile of inferred SNP alleles regardless of the chemical or biological history of the sample.  Several real world scenarios have been evaluated. Here we include a study of four European subjects that had both pigmented and non-pigmented (or gray and non-gray) hair shafts. We tested whether (a) protein profiles change as a result of the loss of pigmentation and (b) these changes were reflected in the inferred genotype derived from detection of genetically variant peptides. Using this information, we can determine whether the resulting GVP profiles are more dependent on the biological context of pigmentation status or the underlying genotype.

While significant efforts have been invested in analyzing the HLA peptidomes of fresh tumors, it is often impossible to obtain sufficient volumes of tumor tissues for comprehensive HLA peptidome characterization. This work attempted to overcome some of these obstacles by using patient-derived xenograft tumors (PDX) in mice as the tissue sources for HLA peptidome analysis. PDX tumor provide a proxy for expansion of the patient tumor by re-grafting them through several passages to immune compromised mice. The HLA peptidomes of human biopsies were compared to those derived from PDX tumors. Larger HLA peptidomes were obtained from the significantly larger PDX tumors as compared to the patient biopsies. The HLA peptidomes of different PDX tumors derived from the same source tumor biopsy were very reproducible, even following subsequent passages to new naïve mice. A large number of CTA-derived HLA peptides were discovered, as well as several neoantigens. Taken together, use of PDX tumors for HLA peptidome analysis serves as a highly expandable and stable source of reproducible and authentic peptidomes, opening up new opportunities for defining large HLA peptidomes when only small tumor biopsies are available. This approach provides a large source for tumor antigens identification potentially useful for personalized immunotherapy.

Structural and functional brain alterations are reflected in the protein composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) patients have higher CSF levels of tau, but we lack knowledge of systems-wide changes of CSF protein levels that accompany AD. Here we present a highly reproducible mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics workflow for the in-depth analysis of CSF from minimal sample amounts. From three independent studies (>200 individuals), we characterize differences in proteins by AD status (>1,000 proteins, CV<20%). Proteins with previous links to neurodegeneration such as tau, SOD1 and PARK7 differed most strongly by AD status, providing strong positive controls for our approach. CSF proteome changes in Alzheimerâ€™s disease prove to be widespread and often correlated with tau concentrations.

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomics is a rapid and highly sensitive approach for high-throughput identification of phosphorylation sites. However, the exact localization of phosphorylation sites which depends on trypsin-centric shotgun phosphoproteomics is often arbitrary and unreliable because of the limited product ion coverage in the MS2 spectra. Therefore, phosphorylation site determination from MS data with a single protease cannot be expected to be comprehensive, regardless of the strategy used for phosphopeptide detection. Here, we have explored the application of LysargiNase which was recently reported to mirror trypsin in specificity to cleave arginine and lysine residues exclusively at the N-terminal side. Our data demonstrates that the combined application of LysargiNase and trypsin results in higher sequence coverage with more complete ladder sequences which is helpful to pinpoint the precise phosphorylation sites. Therefore, the combined use of these two enzymes will partially overcome the limitations of trypsin-centric phosphoproteomics to achieve a more reliable phosphoproteome and to increase the identification of novel phosphorylation sites.

Using degron tags we analyse how acute depletion of these proteins affects mitosis. Loss of Cyclin A in G2-phase prevents the initial activation of Cdk1. Cells lacking Cyclin B can enter mitosis and phosphorylate most mitotic proteins, because of parallel PP2A:B55 phosphatase inactivation by Greatwall kinase. The final barrier to mitotic establishment corresponds to nuclear envelope breakdown that requires a decisive shift in the balance of Cdk1 and PP2A:B55 activity. Beyond this point Cyclin B/Cdk1 is essential to phosphorylate a distinct subset mitotic Cdk1 substrates that are essential to complete cell division. Our results identify how Cyclin A, B and Greatwall coordinate mitotic progression by increasing levels of Cdk1-dependent substrate phosphorylation.  The phosphoproteomics dataset aims to identify substrates that are affected specifically by acute depletion of Cyclin Bprotein.

On the global scenario, PKDL in mainly restricted to distinct zones of South Asia (India, Nepal and Bangladesh) and East Africa, mainly Sudan. In India, the most prominent fatal form of leishmaniasis present is VL, affecting entirely the eastern region of the country. The clinical presentation of VL and PKDL differ substantially; where VL patients suffer from sustained fever, hepatospleenomegaly, weight loss and anemia, PKDL patients manifest dermal lesions in the form of macular, nodular and polymorphic.  Although, compared to VL, the mortality rate of PKDL is significantly lower, yet it is observed as a stigmatizing disease that brings a substantial socioeconomic burden, further intensified by a hesitancy of patients, to obtain treatment, or due to noncompliance. Lesions, especially the polymorphic forms, are parasite-rich, concluding that PKDL plays a crucial role in the anthroponotic transmission of VL. PKDL patients with Macular lesions, having comparatively lower parasitic load, and thus lacks detection sensitivity with standard techniques like rK39 (73% sensitivity), Leishmanin skin test (54% sensitivity) and Histopathological studies with patients’ skin biopsy sample (7-33% sensitivity) and is often misdiagnosed as Vitiligo cases. In order to completely eliminate Kala-azar in Southeast Asia, proper identification of various routes of the disease is essential, which could efficiently distinguish between cured PKDL and active PKDL as well as active PKDL from other cross disease like Leprosy and Vitiligo. Till now very less work has been done towards biomarker identification for PKDL from patients’ plasma. Most of the methods for disease identification are based on highly invasive tissue biopsy followed by PCR/qPCR. Recently investigations from our group have demonstrated the presence of novel glycoproteins in the circulating immune complexes (CICs) from serum, as biomarkers for early identification of PKDL patients. An Immune complex (IC), sometimes called an antigen-antibody complex, is a molecule formed from the integral binding of an antibody to a soluble antigen. After an antigen-antibody reaction, the immune complexes can be subject to any number of responses, including complement deposition, opsonisation, phagocytosis, or processing by proteases. Accumulation of ICs leads to a broad spectrum of pro-inflammatory effects, including activation of the complement cascade and induction of cytokine secretion. These complexes may also be deposited in tissues and vessel walls, leading to inflammation, tissue damage and, ultimately, disease manifestations. Immune complexes also affect disease progression and outcome in various disorders through the induction of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines. In the present study we hypothesize that the CICs’ proteome is altered among PKDL patients with different dermal manifestations (Macular and Polymorphic) as compared to Cured individuals (CR) and Healthy controls (HI). The aim of this current study is to identify differentially expressed CIC proteomic profile among different forms PKDL patients as compared to HI. The differential protein expression of specific unique peptide fragments, representing specific proteins, could be used as diagnostic biomarkers in early detection of both Macular and Polymorphic PKDL cases. In this prospective study, we included PKDL patients with Macular and/or Polymorphic lesion, Cured individuals and HI. Among the enrolled patients, blood samples were collected from 20 primarily confirmed PKDL patients with Macular lesions, 20 primarily confirmed PKDL patients with Polymorphic lesions, 12 Cured individuals previously suffering from PKDL and 12 Healthy individuals; collected during the period of 2015-2016, stored at -80°C. Next the CICs were purified from PKDL patients’ plasma and LC MS/MS analysis was performed using Q-ExactivePlusOrbitrap mass spectrometer. This work for the first time revealed the differential CICs proteome profile among different forms of PKDL patients as compared to their Cured and Healthy counterparts.

It is characterized by periodontal attachment destruction, bone resorption, and eventual tooth loss. Salivary biomarkers have been sought to predict and prevent periodontitis. This comparative study analyzed the salivary proteome of 30 individuals with chronic periodontitis (CP) and 10 with periodontal health (PH), and correlated specific proteins with clinical parameters of disease by using mass spectrometry. Stimulated whole saliva was obtained and pooled for 5 healthy controls and 15 CP patients, precipitated with TCA, digested enzymatically with trypsin and analyzed by an LTQ Orbitrap Velos equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. A wide range of salivary proteins of various functions was significantly reduced in CP individuals, whereas salivary acidic proline-rich phosphoprotein, submaxillary gland androgen-regulated protein, histatin, fatty acid-binding protein, thioredoxin, and cystatin were predominant in diseased patients and correlated significantly with signs of periodontal attachment loss and inflammation. Specific salivary proteins were associated with PH and CP. These differences in salivary proteome profiles may contribute to the identification of disease indicators or signatures and the improvement of periodontal diagnosis.

2014	PXD019204	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD019204	An azidoribose probe to track ketoamine adducts in histone ribose glycation (293T nuclei - LFQ)	Reactive cellular metabolites can modify macromolecules and form adducts known as non-enzymatic covalent modifications (NECMs). Dissecting the mechanisms, regulation and consequences of NECMs, such as glycation, has been challenging due to the complex and often ambiguous nature of the adducts formed. Directly tracking the formation of modifications on key targets to uncover their underlying physiological importance requires specific chemical tools. Here we present the novel chemoenzymatic syntheses of an active azido-modified ribose analog, 5-azidoribose (5-AR), as well as an inactive control derivative, 1-azidoribose (1-AR) and their application towards understanding protein ribose-glycation in vitro and in cellulo. With these new probes we found that, similar to MGO-glycation, ribose glycation specifically accumulates on histones. In addition to fluorescent labeling, we demonstrate the utility of the probe in enriching modified targets, which were identified by label-free quantitative proteomics and highresolution MS/MS workflows. Finally, we establish that the known oncoprotein and hexose deglycase, fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K), recognizes and facilitates the removal of 5-AR glycation adducts in live cells, supporting the dynamic regulation of ribose glycation as well as validating the probe as a new chemical tool to monitor FN3K activity. Altogether, we demonstrate this probe’s utilities to uncover ribose-glycation and deglycation events as well as tracking FN3K activity towards establishing its potential as a new cancer vulnerability.

In that respect, the MET RTK is deregulated in abundance and/or activity in a variety of human tumors. Using two proteomic techniques, we explored how the MET inhibitor tepotinib modulates global cellular phosphorylation response to ionizing radiation (IR).

Little is known about the molecular make-up of human EEC subtypes and the regulated secretion of individual hormones. Here we describe an organoid-based platform for functional studies of human EECs. EEC formation is induced in vitro by transient expression of NEUROG3. A set of gut organoids was engineered in which the major hormones are fluorescently tagged.  A single-cell mRNA atlas was generated for the different EEC subtypes, and their secreted products were recorded by mass-spectrometry. We note key differences with murine EECs, including in hormones, sensory receptors and transcription factors. Notably, several novel hormone-like molecules were identified. Inter-EEC communication is exemplified by Secretin-induced GLP-1 secretion. Indeed, individual EEC subtypes carry receptors for various EEC hormones. This study provides a rich resource to study human EEC development and function.

Transcriptomic and biochemical approaches have established comprehensive catalogues of ISGs across species and cell types, but their antiviral mechanisms remain incompletely characterized. Here, we apply a combination of quantitative proteomic approaches to map IFN-induced rearrangements in the human protein-protein interaction network. Specifically, we analyzed the IFN-induced changes to the HeLa cell proteome with shotgun mass spectrometry.

To gain an understanding of the molecular mechanism, we set out to identify its binding partners by interaction proteomics. TAP-MS/MS analysis of different SLC15A4 protein variants provided a global view of the SLC15A4 interaction landscape. Among the proteins detected, the uncharacterized protein CXorf21 emerged as a prominent and specific binder. CXorf21 is a X chromosome-encoded gene which has also been linked to SLE by a GWAS. CXorf21 was robustly identified with all the SLC15A4 constructs tested, indicating that the interaction does not require the N-terminal or central cytoplasmic region of the transporter.

Generated peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) were post-processed based on the target-decoy approach (Elias & Gygi, 2007) using Percolator (version 3.01) (The, MacCoss et al., 2016) and filtered for an estimated FDR of less than 1%. Protein groups implied by peptides across all samples was simplified using an in-house script based on Occam’s razor principle. The number of PSMs per gene (based on UniProt annotation) and biological sample (collapsing technical replicates) served as input to SAINT (version 2) (Choi, Liu et al., 2012) for probabilistic scoring of bait-prey interactions using the GFP samples as control. Significant interactions (FDR of less than 1%) were visualized as network in Cytoscape 3.5.1 (Shannon, Markiel et al., 2003).

The proliferation, differentiation, and cell death of epidermal progenitor cells have to be delicately regulated, as deregulation of this process can lead to many skin diseases, including skin cancers. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in skin homeostasis remain poorly defined. In this study, with quantitative proteomics approach, we identified an important interaction between KDF1 (Keratinocyte Differentiation Factor 1) and IKKα (IκB kinase α) in differentiating skin keratinocytes. Ablation of either KDF1 or IKKα in mice leads to similar but striking abnormalities in skin development, particularly in skin epidermal differentiation. With biochemical and mouse genetics approach, we further demonstrate that the interaction of IKKα and KDF1 is essential for epidermal differentiation. To probe deeper into the mechanisms, we find that KDF1 associates with a deubiquitinating protease, USP7 (Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 7), and KDF1 can regulate skin differentiation through deubiquitination and stabilization of IKKα. Taken together, our study unravels an important molecular mechanism underlying skin tissue homeostasis and epidermal differentiation.

Mutations in the gene encoding cystatin B (CSTB) are the primary genetic cause of EPM1. Here, we investigate the role of CSTB during neurogenesis in vivo in the developing mouse brain and in vitro in human cerebral organoids (hCOs) derived from EPM1 patients.   Remarkably, we find that CSTB (but not one of its pathological variants) is secreted into the mouse cerebral spinal fluid and the conditioned media from hCOs. In embryonic mouse brain, we find that functional CSTB influence progenitors’ proliferation and simultaneously modulate neuronal distribution by attracting interneurons to the site of secretion via cell non-autonomous mechanisms. Similarly, in patient-derived hCOs, low levels of functional CSTB result in an alteration of progenitor’s proliferation, premature differentiation, and changes in interneurons migration. Secretion and extracellular matrix organization are the biological processes particularly affected as revealed by proteomic analysis in patients’ hCOs. Overall, our data shed new light on the cellular mechanisms underlying the development of EPM1.

Here we present a rapid and reproducible phosphoproteomics approach to systematically analyze hundreds of samples by fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using data independent acquisition (DIA). To overcome the inherent issue of positional phosphopeptide isomers in DIA-based phosphoproteomics, we developed and employed an accurate site localization scoring algorithm, which is incorporated into the Spectronaut software tool. Using a library of synthetic phosphopeptides spiked-in to a yeast phosphoproteome in different ratios we show that it is on par with the top site localization score for data-dependent acquisition (DDA) based phosphoproteomics. Single-shot DIA-based phosphoproteomics achieved an order of magnitude broader dynamic range, higher reproducibility of identification and improved sensitivity and accuracy of quantification compared to state-of-the-art DDA-based phosphoproteomics. Importantly, direct DIA without the need of spectral libraries performed almost on par with analyses using specific project-specific libraries. Moreover, we implemented and benchmarked an algorithm for globally determining phosphorylation site stoichiometry in DIA. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the DIA approach by systematically analyzing the effects of thirty different kinase inhibitors in context of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling showing that a large proportion of EGF-dependent phospho-regulation is mediated by a specific set of protein kinases.

All participants will be questionnaired with appropriate tools evaluating quality of life of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder diary. Urine samples will be taken twice with 7 day gap and then prepared for further evaluation with mass spectrophotometry. Mass spectrophotometry will be performed for all labeled samples with QExactive spectrophotometer.

During the recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV), myalgia was one of the most frequently reported symptoms. We investigated the susceptibility of human muscle cells to ZIKV infection. Using an in vitro model of human primary myoblasts that can be differentiated into myotubes, we found that myoblasts can be productively infected by ZIKV. In contrast, myotubes were shown to be resistant to ZIKV infection, suggesting a differentiation-dependent susceptibility. Infection was accompanied by a caspase-independent cytopathic effect, associated with paraptosis-like cytoplasmic vacuolization. Proteomic profiling was performed 24h and 48h post-infection in cells infected with two different isolates. Proteome changes indicate that ZIKV infection induces an upregulation of proteins involved in the activation of the Interferon type I pathway, and a downregulation of protein synthesis. This work constitutes the first observation of primary human muscle cells susceptibility to ZIKV infection, and differentiation-dependent restriction of infection from myoblasts to myotubes. Since myoblasts constitute the reservoir of stem cells involved in reparation/regeneration in muscle tissue, the infection of muscle cells and the viral-induced alterations observed here could have consequences in ZIKV infection pathogenesis.

The following search parameters were applied: carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification, oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. The mass tolerances in MS and MS/MS were set to 5 ppm and 20 ppm respectively. Maximum peptide charge was set to 7 and 7 amino acids were required as minimum peptide length. A false discovery rate of 1% was set up for both protein and peptide levels. A match between run features was selected with a matched time window set at 1 min and alignment time window set at 20 min. Quantification was performed using the XIC-based LFQ algorithm with the Fast LFQ mode as described in a previous publication67. Unique and razor peptides, included modified peptides, with at least 2 ratio count were accepted for quantification. Statistical analysis of proteomics data For the statistical analysis of one condition versus another, proteins identified in the reverse and contaminant databases and proteins only identified by site were first discarded from the list. Then, proteins exhibiting fewer than 2 LFQ values or in at least one condition were discarded from the list to avoid misidentified proteins. After log2 transformation of the leftover proteins, LFQ values were normalized by median centering within conditions (normalizeD function of the R package DAPAR69). Remaining proteins without any LFQ value in one condition only have been considered as proteins quantitatively present in a condition and absent in another. They have therefore been set aside and considered as differentially abundant proteins. Next, missing values were imputed using the imp.norm function of the R package norm. Proteins with a log2 (fold-change) inferior to 1 have been considered as proteins which are not significantly differentially abundant. Statistical testing of the remaining proteins (having a log2 (fold-change) superior to 1) was conducted using a limma t-test70 thanks to the R package limma71. An adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to the resulting p-values thanks to the function adjust.p of R package cp4p72 using a robust method73 to estimate the proportion of true null hypotheses among the set of statistical tests. The proteins associated to an adjusted p-value inferior to an FDR level of 1% have been considered as significantly differentially abundant proteins. Finally, the proteins of interest are therefore those which emerge from this statistical analysis supplemented by those which are considered to be absent from one condition and present in another. Statistical enrichment tests were used to highlight major biological processes that may be affected during the infection, using DAVID software35 by selecting the set of quantified proteins among all replicates as background. Biological processes related to up/down-regulated proteins in each condition have been compared to those of up/down-regulated proteins in non-infected samples. If not specified, statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests were used to test the differences between groups. Pvalues of less than 0.05 were considered significant.	2020-01-23

Initially, a dependent setting of a central value plus minus a variation is available to the users to set up NCEs, and the combination of 30±10% to give the energies 20%/30%/40% has been mostly adopted in the literature. With the recent availability of independent NCE setup, we found that the combination of 20%/30%/30% is better than 20%/30%/40%; in the analysis of complex intact N-glycopeptides enriched from gastric cancer tissues, total IDs with spectrum-level FDR≤1%, site-specific IDs with site-determining fragment ions and structure-specific IDs with structure-diagnostic fragment ions were increased by 42% (4,767->6,746), 57% (599->942), and 97% (1771->3495), respectively. This finding will benefit all the coming N-glycoproteomics studies using HCD as the dissociation method.

For search of matched precursor and fragment ions, isotopic peak abundance cutoff (IPACO), isotopic peak mass-to-charge (m/z) deviation (IPMD), and isotopic peak abundance deviation (IPAD) were set at 40%, 20 ppm and 50%, respectively. Search parameters for intact N-glycopeptide spectrum matches (GPSMs) include the following refinement criteria: Y1 ions, Top4; minimal percentage of matched fragment ions of peptide backbones, ≥10%; minimal matched fragment ions of N-glycan, ≥1; TopN hits, N=2 (top1 hits have the lowest P score). N-Glycosites are localized with Glyco-brackets (G-brackets) which are defined as the number of core GlcNAc-containing fragment ion pairs each of which can independently confine the N-glycosylation to a unique N-X-S/T/C sequon when multiple sequons exist on the peptide backbones. GF score is defined as number of structure-diagnostic fragment ions. GPSMs from forward and decoy searches were combined, and a cutoff P score was then chosen to obtain spectrum-level FDR≤1%; intact N-glycopeptide IDs were obtained with duplicate removal using peptide sequence, N-glycosite and N-glycan linkage as the grouping criteria.	2019-12-20

Until now, the ability to study these events was lacking. We developed VIR-CLASP (VIRal Cross-Linking And Solid-phase Purification) to characterize the earliest interactions between viral RNA and cellular proteins. We investigated the infection of human cells using Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Influenza A virus and identified hundreds of direct RNA-protein interactions. Here, we validate the biological impact of three protein classes that bind CHIKV RNA within minutes of infection. We find CHIKV RNA binds and hijacks the lipid-modifying enzyme FASN for pro-viral activity. We show that CHIKV genomes are N6-methyladenosine modified and that YTHDF1 binds and suppresses its replication. Finally, we find that the innate immune DNA sensor IFI16 associates with CHIKV RNA, reducing viral replication and maturation. Our findings have direct applicability to the investigation of potentially all RNA viruses.

In recent years, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) protein has been characterized as a primary cytosolic DNA sensor during infection with bacteria, DNA viruses, or retroviruses. While the role of cGAS in downstream immune signaling through STING-TBK1-IRF3 proteins is well-defined, regulatory mechanisms of cGAS activity, such as through post-translational modifications (PTMs), are still an active area of research. Here, we report a comprehensive characterization of cGAS phosphorylations and acetylations in three different cell types. Data-dependent proteomic analyses of immunoaffinity purified cGAS was performed in HEK293T cells under control and DNA-challenged conditions (N = 3 each) and human fibroblasts (HFF) cells under control and HSV-1 infected conditions (N = 4 each) to generate candidate cGAS PTM sites. Using parallel reaction monitoring, a total of 11 PTMs (4 phosphorylations and 7 acetylations) were validated in HEK293T, HFF, and THP-1 cells. Of these, 3 phosphorylations and 5 acetylations have not been previously identified. The functions of these modifications were by generating a series of mutants and measuring cGAS-dependent apoptotic and immune signaling activities.

2039	PXD015880	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD015880	Exploring the impact of PARK2 mutations on the total and mitochondrial proteome of human skin         fibroblasts	Mutations in PARK2 gene are the most frequent cause of familial forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). This gene encodes Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in several cellular mechanisms, such as the mitophagic process. Mutations in this gene, which cause the loss of function of Parkin, are responsible for the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. This improper disposal may generate increased levels of ROS, lower ATP production and apoptosis activation. Given the importance of mitochondrial dysfunctions and mitophagy impairment in PD pathogenesis, the aim of the present project was to investigate both whole-cell and mitochondrial proteome alterations in human skin fibroblasts of PARK2-mutated patients. To this purpose, total and mitochondrial-enriched protein fractions from fibroblasts of five PARK2-mutated patients and five control subjects were analyzed by quantitative shotgun proteomics, in order to identify proteins specifically altered by Parkin loss. Both the network-based and the GSEA analysis of proteomics results pointed out the importance of pathways in which Rab GTPase proteins are involved. An alteration of their levels also in the mitochondrial fraction may indicate a re-localization of these GTP/GDP molecular switches, master regulators of membrane trafficking. To have a more comprehensive view of the mitochondrial alterations due to PARK2 mutations, we investigated the impact of Parkin loss on mitochondrial function and network morphology. We unveiled that the mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced in PARK2-mutated patients. Nevertheless, PINK1 did not accumulate on depolarized mitochondria. Even after the treatment with CCCP, an ionophore that triggers mitophagy, the accumulation of PINK1 was less efficient in PARK2-mutated patients than in controls derived fibroblasts. The analysis of the mitochondrial network morphology showed a filamentous network with mitochondria distributed all over the cell that was comparable between PARK2-mutated patients and control subjects. Thus, our results suggested that the network morphology was not influenced by the mitochondrial depolarization and by the lack of Parkin, revealing a possible impairment of fission and, more in general, of mitochondrial dynamics. In conclusion, the present work highlighted new molecular factors and pathways altered by PARK2 mutations. Furthermore, we obtained a definition of the mitochondrial landscape and molecular mechanisms underlying the PARK2 form of Parkinson’s disease, which will help to unravel possible biochemical pathways altered also in the sporadic form of the disease. Indeed, it is known that in sporadic cases the genetic/epigenetic background and the environment lead over time to mitochondria impairment and to the accumulation of damaged organelles.

Although MDSCs were initially described as bone-marrow-derived immature myeloid cells (either monocytic [m-MDSC] or granulocytic [g-MDSC]), also mature neutrophils have been shown to exert MDSC activity towards T cells, in ways that so far remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that human neutrophils – both from healthy donors and cancer patients – do not exert MDSC activity unless they are activated. Using neutrophils with genetically well-defined defects, we found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and granule-derived constituents are required for MDSC activity after direct CD11b-dependent neutrophil-T cell interactions. Besides these cellular interactions, neutrophils were engaged in the uptake of pieces of T cell membrane, a process called trogocytosis. Together, these interactions led to changes in T cell morphology, mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion, as indicated by electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and metabolic parameters. Our studies characterize the different steps by which activated mature neutrophils induce functional T cell non-responsiveness and irreparable cell damage.

The following parameters were considered to identify peptides: 1) Digestion by trypsin with at most two missed cleavages; 2) variable modification by oxidation (M) and fixed modification by carbamidomethyl (C); 3) a calculated false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1% across all conditions, calculated by a reverse databank created on-the-fly; 4) mass error less than 20 ppm; and 5) ion match criteria of at least 2 fragment ions per peptide and at least 5 fragment ions per protein. Identifications that did not satisfy these criteria were rejected. Also, as a default parameter, we apply protein grouping, which hides proteins whose peptides are a subset of other proteins. Keratins were removed from our data.	2019-08-29	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.jprot.2020.103813"",""PMID:32464195""]]"

However, those methods had never been compared in samples from the same tumor and patient. In this work, we compared the two most used methods, elution and centrifugation, in pieces of the same biopsy samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). First, we established that high G-force (10000g) was required to obtain TIF from cSCC by centrifugation. Secondly, we compared the centrifugation method with the elution method in pieces of three different cSCC tumors. We found that the mean protein intensities based in the number of peptide spectrum matches was significantly higher in the centrifuged samples than in the eluted samples. Regarding the robustness of the methods, we observed higher overlapping between both methods (77-80%) than among samples (50%). These results suggest that exists an elevated consistence of TIF composition independently of the method used. However, we observed a three-fold increase of extracellular proteins in non-overlapped proteome obtained by centrifugation. We therefore conclude that centrifugation is the method of choice to study the proteome of TIF from cutaneous biopsies.

As MWCNT are produced in large quantities, occupational exposure and human health is of particular concern. However, there is no consensus regarding their potential harmful effects. In particular, chronic exposure to MWCNT and mechanisms of their action at protein and lipid levels are unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate effects of long-term chronic exposure to MWCNT on cellular proteome and lipidome. Since the lung is the major target organ, an in vitro normal bronchial epithelial cell model was used. To better mimic exposure at occupational settings, cells were chronically exposed for 13 weeks to low-doses of MWCNT. MWCNT-treatment increased ROS levels in cells without increasing DNA damage and resulted in differential expression of multiple apoptotic proteins. A shotgun proteomic and lipidomic analysis of the MWCNT-exposed cells showed that of amongst the >5000 identified protein s,groups; more than 200 were altered in treated cells.  Functional analysis revealed association of these differentially regulated proteins in various cellular processes such as cell death and survival, cellular assembly and organization. Similarly, the lipid profile of the MWCNT treated cells showed accumulation of multiple lipid classes. This is first study to present results indicating that long-term MWCNT-exposure of human normal lung cells at occupationally relevant low-dose may alter both the proteome and the lipidome profile of target epithelial cells in the lung.

Highly conserved in mammals, various members of NEKs (Nima-related kinases) cross-function in signaling networks depicted in at least one of the following main biological processes: mitotic events, DNA damage repair and response and in cilliagenesis. Recent studies have shown new functions for NEK1, 2, 4 and 5 in mitochondria respiration, apoptosis and protein complexes. NEK10 is the least studied member of the Neks, nevertheless NEK10 has been reported in Neks recurrent functions: G2/M control, centrosomes and cilliagenesis. Besides, the downregulation of Nek10 was associated with poor prognosis and aggressive breast tumors. Given that Neks function relies on protein signaling networks, we investigated Nek10 protein interacting partners and Nek10´s biological roles through IP-MS/MS. Our mass spectrometry data identified new interactions for Nek10 proteomics including mitochondria functional genes: SIRT3, ATAD3A, ATAD3B and OAT. The number of mitochondrial partners was augmented more than 3-fold after zeocin treatment: FKBP4, TXN, PFDN2, ATAD3B, MRPL12, ATP5J, DUT, YWHAE, CS, SIRT3, HSPA9, PDHB, GLUD1, DDX3X, and APEX1. We focused on exerting Nek10 function on the mitochondria and we first confirmed Nek10 localization in the mitochondria and its interaction with mitochondria proteins. To extend our understanding in Nek10 roles, we depleted Nek10 in mammalian cell lines further denoting mitochondria-related phenotypes such as inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, loss of mtDNA amplification and defects on mitochondria morphology. Our proteomics and functional data contributes to the first evidences of Nek10 role in mitochondria and our overall work drive Nek10 unknown roads towards the avenues of modulating mechanisms of diseases.

However, therapy response is limited to subgroups of patients and clinically useful predictive biomarkers for treatment outcome are lacking. To discover treatment-related systemic changes in plasma and potential biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes, we analysed 45 plasma samples from 24 patients with metastatic (stage IV) CM, using HiRIEF LC-MS/MS, collected before (pre-trm) and during treatment (trm). Of these, 27 samples were taken from 15 metastatic CM patients treated with ICIs (13 pre-trm and 14 trm samples; 12 matched) and 9 patients treated with MAPKis (9 matched). Matched samples were trm and pre-trm samples taken from the same individual before treatment and after the first cycle of treatment (before the second cycle). We have analysed the change in the plasma protein levels during treatment by comparing the plasma levels in the trm samples to the pre-trm samples, to detect treatment-induced alterations in the plasma proteome. We have analysed the patients treated with ICIs separately from the patients treated with MAPKis, to detect treatment-specific changes for both.

The protein composition of this biological structure has been to date studied by targeted analyses of specific salivary proteins. In order to perform a more exhaustive proteome characterization of pellicles, we used TR146 cells expressing or not the transmembrane mucin MUC1 and generated pellicles by incubation with human saliva and washing to remove unbound proteins. A suitable method was established for the in vitro isolation of the mucosal pellicle by “shaving” it from the cells using trypsin. Comparison of pellicle and saliva compositions evidenced the adsorption of proteins not previously reported as pellicle constituents such as proteins of the PLUNC family. Pellicles formed on TR146 and TR146/MUC1 were also analyzed and compared by protein label-free quantification.

ET tumors have a different phenotype than endometrial tumors which typically develop de novo without previous exposure to tamoxifen (EN). Here we aimed to identify specific protein markers that could serve as specific molecular targets in either phenotype. A set of total 45 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) endometrial tumor tissue and adjacent myometrial tissue samples were analyzed using LC-MS/MS in SWATH-MS mode. We found that calcyphosin (CAPS) levels were elevated in EN tumors compared to ET tumors. The higher CAPS level in EC tissue invading to myometrium support its relationship to EC aggressiveness. Further, stathmin (STMN1) levels were found significantly elevated in ET vs. EN tumors and significantly associated with patient survival. This finding connects elevated levels of this cell cycle regulating, proliferation-associated protein with tamoxifen exposure. In a summary, using SWATH-MS we show that CAPS and STMN1 should be recognized as clinicopathologically different EC markers of which STMN1 is specifically connected with a previous tamoxifen exposition.

"Tumor microenvironment or stroma has the potency to regulate the behavior of malignant cells. Fibroblast-like cells are abundant in tumor stroma and they are also responsible for the synthesis of many extracellular matrix components. Fibroblast–cancer cell interplay can modify the functions of both cell types.   We applied mass spectrometry and proteomics to unveil the matrisome in 3D spheroids formed by DU145 prostate cancer cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells or prostate derived fibroblasts. Similarly DU145/fibroblast and PC3/fibroblast co-culture spheroids were also analyzed. Western Blotting and immunofluorescence were used to confirm the presence of specific proteins in spheroids. Cancer dissemination was studied by utilizing ""out of spheroids"" migration and invasion assays.  In the spheroid model cancer cell–fibroblast interplay caused remarkable changes in extracellular matrix and accelerated the invasion of DU145 cells. Fibroblasts produced structural matrix proteins, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases. In cancer cell/fibroblast co-cultures basement membrane components, including laminins (3, 5, 2, 3), heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG2 gene product), and collagen XVIII accumulated in a prominent manner when compared to spheroids that contained fibroblasts or cancer cells only. Furthermore, collagen XVIII was intensively processed to different endostatin isoforms by cancer cell derived cathepsin L.  To sum up, fibroblasts can promote carcinoma cell dissemination by several different mechanisms. Extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins provide attachment sites for cell locomotion promoting adhesion receptors. Growth factors and metalloproteinases are known to accelerate cell invasion.

The molecular events underpinning transcriptional elongation and processivity and CDK-Cyclins involved remain poorly understood. Using CRISPR-CAS9 homology-directed-repair we generated analog-sensitive-kinase variants of CDK12 and CDK13 to probe their individual and shared biological and molecular roles. Single inhibition of CDK12 or CDK13 induced transcriptional responses associated with DNA-damage and cellular growth signaling pathways respectively, with minimal effects on cell viability. In contrast, dual-kinase inhibition potently induced cell death, which was associated with extensive genome-wide transcriptional changes including wide-spread use of alternative 3’ polyadenylation sites. At the molecular level dual-kinase inhibition resulted in the loss of POLII CTD phosphorylation and greatly reduced POLII elongation rates and processivity. These data define significant redundancy between CDK12 and CDK13, and identify both as fundamental regulators of global POLII processivity and transcription elongation.

The database search was performed using the Uniprot Homo sapiens database plus common contaminants with strict trypsin specificity allowing up to 3 missed cleavages. The minimum peptide length was 7 amino acids. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was a fixed modification while N-acetylation of proteins N-termini, oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of Serine/Threonine/Tyrosine were set as variable modifications. During the MaxQuant main search, precursor ion mass error tolerance was set to 4.5 ppm and fragment ions were allowed a mass deviation of 20 ppm. PSM and protein identifications were filtered using a target-decoy approach at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% with the match between runs option enabled. Further analysis was performed using a custom pipeline developed in R, which utilizes the MaxQuant output file evidence.txt. A feature was defined as the combination of peptide sequence, charge and modification. Features not found in at least 80% of the replicates in one group were removed. To correct for injection volume variability, feature intensities were normalized by converting to base 2 logarithms and then multiplying each value by the ratio of maximum median intensity of all replicates over median replicate intensity. Missing values were imputed using a random normal distribution of values with the mean set at mean of the real distribution of values minus 2.2 s.d., and a s.d. of 0.15 times the s.d. of the distribution of the measured intensities. The probability of differential peptide expression between groups was calculated using the Limma R package (version 3.34.9). Probability values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini–Hochberg method. The heatmap for differentially phosphorylated peptides (adj. p-value < 0.3, 1-NM-PP1 treatment relative to DMSO treatment) was generated in R (v 3.5.1) using the gplots heatmap.2 function (v3.0.1.1). Differntially phosphorylated peptides with Adj. p-value ≤0.3  and logFC < 0 relative to DMSO treatment in 1-NM-PP1 treated CDK13AS/AS and #2 CDK12AS/NULL; CDK13AS/AS (excluding peptides with an Adj. p-value ≤ 0.3 in 1-NM-PP1 treated WT clone) were included in the Venn diagram.

Sequestration of mRNAs by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) into stress granules (SGs) reduces translation, but it remains unclear whether SGs also function in partitioning of specific transcripts to polysomes (PSs) to guide selective translation and stress-adaptation in cancer. Transcripts enriched in PSs, defined by polysome fractionation and RNAseq, were compared with mRNAs complexed with the SG-nucleator protein, G3BP1, defined by spatially-restricted enzymatic tagging. Short-term oxidative stress profoundly altered mRNA translation by promoting selective enrichment of transcripts within SGs or PSs. G3BP1 participates in this compartmentalisation by sequestering transcripts in SGs. Under stress, G3BP1-bound transcripts are PS-depleted and encode proteins involved in mRNA translation, pro-apoptosis, and mitochondrial function. In contrast, specific PS-enriched transcripts disassociate from G3BP1 under stress to encode proteins involved in diverse cellular cytoprotective pathways. Therefore, G3BP1 partitioning guides selective translation to support stress adaptation and cell survival.

Endothelial mechanosensors perceive and translate mechanical signals via cellular signaling pathways into biological processes that control endothelial development, phenotype and function. Here, we aim to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial mechanosensing. Approach and results We applied a quantitative mass spectrometry approach combined with cell surface chemical footprinting to assess the hemodynamic effects on the endothelium on a system-wide level. These studies revealed that of the >5000 quantified proteins 104 were altered, which were highly enriched for extracellular matrix proteins and proteins involved in cell-matrix adhesion. Cell surface proteomics furthermore indicated that LAMA4 was proteolytically processed upon flow-exposure, which corresponded to the decreased LAMA4 mass observed on immunoblot. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies highlighted that the endothelial basement membrane was drastically remodeled upon flow exposure. We observed a network-like pattern of LAMA4 and LAMA5, which corresponded to the localization of laminin-adhesion molecules ITGA6 and ITGB4. Furthermore, the adaptation to flow-exposure did not affect the inflammatory response to tumor necrosis factor α, indicating that inflammation and flow trigger fundamentally distinct endothelial signaling pathways with limited reciprocity and synergy. Conclusions Taken together, this study uncovers the blood flow-induced remodeling of the basement membrane and stresses the importance of the subendothelial basement membrane in vascular homeostasis.

Here we describe that CD2 co-stimulation plays a critical role in the functioning of human cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). We found that CD2 promotes the formation of functional immune synapses by orchestrating the polarization of lytic granules towards the synaptic interface. To broadly explore the CD2 signaling network, we undertook an analysis of protein phosphorylation in CD2-stimulated CTLs, which revealed 549 unique CD2-regulated phosphorylation events in 373 proteins. CD2 stimulation elicited an intricated network of signaling events participating in the regulation of T cell metabolism, vesicular trafficking, autophagy, cell polarity and cytoskeleton organization. We further show that a functionally critical node of this network is the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which regulates granule polarization at the CTL synapse. Polarized trafficking of granules is driven by the concerted action of TAK1/LKB1/CamKK2 kinases, which locally activate AMPK enriched on CTL lysosome membranes, illustrating a novel functional cross-talk between vesicular compartments in CTLs. Our results thus establish CD2 signaling as key for regulating targeted granule secretion in CTLs and reveal an AMPK-dependent mechanism to explain how AMPK-activating drugs boost anti-tumour CTL activity.

In this study we focused on gingipain-exerted proteolysis at the cell surface of human gingival epithelial cells (telomerase immortalized gingival keratinocytes [TIGK]). We examined whether gingipains have sheddase activity or if their main activity is degradation of membrane proteins into small fragments. Using mass spectrometry, we investigated the whole sheddome/degradome of TIGK cell surface proteins by P. gingivalis strains differing in gingipain expression. We observed extensive degradation of TIGK surface proteins, suggesting that gingipains could in fact be the major cause of damage to the gingival epithelium. Most of the identified gingipain substrates were molecules involved in adhesion, suggesting that gingipains may cause tissue damage through cleavage of cell contacts, resulting in cell detachment and rounding, and consequently leading to anoikis. These results reveal a molecular underpinning to P. gingivalis-induced tissue destruction and enhance our knowledge of the role of P. gingivalis’ proteases in the pathobiology of periodontitis.

The following modifications were set in the searches: Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.0215 Da) as fixed modification, oxidation of methionine (+15.9949 Da) and acetylation of protein N-termini (+42.0106 Da) as variable modifications.

MaxQuant was used for the label-free quantification using default settings. For relative quantification, spectral counting of razor and unique peptides was used.  The data were processed with Perseus to filter potential contaminants, reverse sequences and single peptide identifications. To minimize the number of false positives only proteins with more than 2 counts per protein were considered in the analysis. Protein SCR (spectral count ratios) were calculated by dividing spectral counts in gingipain treated samples by spectral counts in the negative control. Spectral counts of all proteins were increased by 1 to avoid division by zero. When SCR has values between 0.33 and 3 (0.33 < SCR < 3) abundance of selected protein is considered non-changed between control and the sample. SCR lower than 0.33 (SCR ≤ 0.33) means that protein abundance has decreased in the sample, comparing to the control, while SCR greater than 3 (SCR ≥ 3) means that protein abundance has increased in the sample. For the potential target list, we included only extracellular proteins that had a SCR ratio ≥ 3.	2019-10-02	"[[""DOI:10.3389/fmicb.2020.00722"",""PMID:32411104""]]"

However, the mechanisms underlying how COL11A1 confers cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer are poorly understood. We identified that fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) is upregulated by COL11A1 in ovarian cancer cells and that COL11A1-driven cisplatin resistance can be abrogated by inhibition of FAO. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that COL11A1 also enhances the expression of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis. Interestingly, COL11A1-induced upregulation of fatty acid synthesis and FAO is modulated by the same signaling molecules. We identified that binding of COL11A1 to its receptors, α1β1 integrin and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), activates Src-Akt-AMPK signaling to increase the expression of both fatty acid synthesis and oxidation enzymes, although DDR2 seems to be the predominant receptor. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis downregulates FAO despite the presence of COL11A1, suggesting that fatty acid synthesis might be a driver of FAO in ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that COL11A1 upregulates fatty acid metabolism in ovarian cancer cells in a DDR2-Src-Akt-AMPK dependent manner. Therefore, we propose that blocking FAO might serve as a promising therapeutic target to treat ovarian cancer, particularly cisplatin-resistant recurrent ovarian cancers which typically express high levels of COL11A1.

We and others identified tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the ascites as promoters of metastasis-associated processes like extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, tumor cell migration, adhesion and invasion. The precise mechanisms and mediators involved in these functions of TAM are, however, largely unknown. By comparing monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) differentiated in ascites to TAM-like asc-MDM, by LPS/IFN to inflammatory m1-MDM and by IL-10 to alternatively activated m2c-MDM, we found that conditioned media from both, asc-MDM and m2c-MDM, stimulated migration of patient-derived tumor cells, while m1-MDM failed to do so. Secretome analysis by mass spectrometry identified an overlapping set of 9 proteins secreted by both asc-MDM and m2c-MDM, but not by m1-MDM, in all tested donors. Of these, three proteins, namely transforming growth factor beta induced protein (TGFBI), tenascin C (TNC) and fibronectin (FN1), have been associated with migration-related functions. Intriguingly, increased ascites concentrations of TGFBI, TNC and fibronectin were associated with short progression-free survival. Furthermore, transcriptome and secretome analyses point to TAM as major producers of these proteins, further supporting an essential role for TAM in promoting HGSC progression. Consistent with this hypothesis, we were able to demonstrate that the migration-inducing potential of asc-MDM and m2c-MDM secretomes may be inhibited, at least partially, by neutralizing antibodies against TGFBI and TNC or siRNA-mediated silencing of TGFBI expression. In conclusion, the present study provides the first experimental evidence that TAM-derived TGFBI and TNC in ascites promote HGSC progression.

Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 3 patients from independent sibships from a large consanguineous family presenting with severe deafness and early-onset cataracts as part of a variable neurological, sensorial and cutaneous syndrome. Medical assessments and imaging were used to define the phenotype. Genome sequencing was performed to unravel the altered genotype by subsequent bioinformatics analysis based on a specific physiopathological filtering approach. We identified a unique homozygous variant in intron 10 of the PSMC3 gene, encoding the 26S proteasome ATPase ring subunit 5 (Rpt5), with a predicted local splice effect as a new donor site (c.1127+337A>G, p.Ser376Argfs15*) confirmed by RT-PCR. Strikingly, fibroblasts derived from patients carrying the deep intronic homozygous PSMC3 pathogenic variant exhibited strong signs of perturbed protein homeostasis, as evidenced by increased accumulation of intracellular ubiquitin-modified proteins. Most interestingly and in contrast to control cells, patient fibroblasts failed to increase their amount of proteasomes following proteasome inhibition using the TCF11/Nrf1 pathway, indicating that these cells were unable to adapt to proteotoxic stress. By way of 2 different zebrafish assays we further show that loss of function of PSMC3 leads to inner ear development anomalies as well as cataracts alike the patient phenotype. We propose that the PSMC3 proteasome subunit dysfunction leads to a novel human syndrome that includes early onset cataracts and deafness and suggest that Rpt5 plays a major role in inner ear and lens development.

This can be achieved by using protocols combining extraction of several lines of evidence, which decreases the material needed for analyses while maximizing the information yield. Archaeological dental calculus is a source of several different types of biomolecules, as well as microfossils, and can tell us about the human host, microbiome, diet, and even occupational activities. Here, we present a unified protocol allowing for simultaneous extraction of DNA and proteins from archaeological dental calculus. We evaluate the protocol on dental calculus from a range of ages and estimated preservation states, and compare it against standard DNA-only and protein-only protocols. We find that most aspects of downstream analyses are unaffected by the unified protocol, although minor shifts in the recovered proteome can be detected. Protein recovery depends on both the amount of starting material and choice of extraction protocol, whereas DNA recovery is significantly lowered through the unified protocol. However, DNA recovery from dental calculus is generally very high, and we found no differences in DNA fragment characteristics or taxonomic profile. In conclusion, the unified protocol allows for simultaneous extraction of two complementary lines of evidence from archaeological dental calculus without compromising downstream analyses, thereby minimizing the need for destructive analysis of this finite resource.

To identify pathways mediating this resistance, we mapped genetic co-dependencies associated with the proteasome. These studies identified cytosolic heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) chaperones as a potential target, mirroring recent studies that have shown mechanism of overcoming PI-induced stress. Here, we first underscore this relationship by mapping genetic co-dependencies in cancer proteostasis. These results lead us to explore HSP70 inhibitors as potential therapeutics. We show these compounds exhibit increased efficacy against both acquired and intrinsic PI-resistant myeloma models, unlike HSP90 inhibition. Surprisingly, shotgun and pulsed-SILAC proteomics reveal that JG’s overcome PI resistance not via the expected mechanism of inhibiting cytosolic HSP70s, but instead through mitochondrial-localized HSP70, HSPA9, destabilizing the 55S mitoribosome. Analysis of myeloma patient data further supports strong effects of global proteostasis capacity, and particularly HSPA9 expression, on response to PI. Our results characterize dynamics of myeloma proteostasis networks under therapeutic pressure while further motivating investigation of HSPA9 as a specific target in PI-resistant disease.   This dataset corresponds to figure 5, experiment outlined in figure 5a.

The spiked peptides in this experiment are histone H3 K27-containing heavy-arginine versions of the peptide ARKSAPATGGVKKPH-R, where K27 was synthetically modified to carry either no methylation, or one or two or three (me3) methyl groups, respectively. Previously to trypsination, the HEK samples were spiked with the 4 SIL peptides. Because the standards have 10 Da greater mass given by the heavy R*, they can be distinguished from their light natural versions in the MS1 spectra. Furthermore, the standards were each spiked at a concentration of 133 fmol and thus, their MS intensities were used to normalize the intensities of the endogenous peptides and quantify them in absolute terms.

Still, the genetic and molecular basis of many cancers remains only partially explained. Genetic predisposition accounts for 5-10% of cancer diagnoses and genetic events cooperating with known somatic driver events are poorly understood. Analyzing established cancer predisposition genes in medulloblastoma (MB), a malignant childhood brain tumor, we recently identified pathogenic germline variants that account for 5% of all MB patients. Here, by extending our previous analysis to include all protein-coding genes, we discovered and replicated rare germline loss-of-function (LoF) variants across Elongator Complex Protein 1 (ELP1) on 9q31.3 in 15% of pediatric MBSHH cases, thus implicating ELP1 as the most common MB predisposition gene and increasing genetic predisposition to 40% for pediatric MBSHH. Inheritance was verified based on parent-offspring and pedigree analysis, which identified two families with a history of pediatric MB. ELP1-associated MBs were restricted to the molecular SHH subtype and were characterized by universal biallelic inactivation of ELP1 due to somatic loss of chromosome 9q. The majority of ELP1-associated MBs exhibited co-occurring somatic PTCH1 (9q22.32) alterations, suggesting that ELP1-deficiency predisposes to tumor development in combination with constitutive activation of SHH signaling. ELP1 is an essential subunit of the evolutionary conserved Elongator complex, whose primary function is to enable efficient translational elongation through tRNAs modifications at the wobble (U34) position. Biochemical, transcriptional, and proteomic analyses revealed that ELP1-associated MBSHH are characterized by a destabilized core Elongator complex, loss of Elongator-dependent tRNA modifications, codon-dependent translational reprogramming, and induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), consistent with deregulation of protein homeostasis due to Elongator-deficiency in model systems. Our findings suggest that genetic predisposition to proteome instability is a previously underappreciated determinant in the pathogenesis of pediatric brain cancer. These results provide strong rationale for further investigating the role of protein homeostasis in other pediatric and adult cancer types and potential opportunities for novel therapeutic interference.

Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and a maximum of two missed cleavage sites were allowed. Oxidized methionine, N-terminal acetylation, and carbamidomethyl cysteine were set as variable modifications. Maximum allowed mass deviation was set to 10 ppm for monoisotopic precursor ions and 0.02 Da for MS/MS peaks.  Spectral library generation Spectral library from DDA analysis was generated with TPP included in myProMS (version 3.6.0) (Poullet et al, 2007[2]). The consensus library used for DIA analysis was built by SpectraST, with the following filter criteria applied: 3 to 6 fragments per peptide and fragment m/z range of 350-2,000 m/z. The combined library contained 465287 precursors (397333 peptides) from 29334 unique proteins.  DIA sample acquisition and analysis The DIA .raw files were converted in mzXML using MSConvert. Through myProMS, the resulting DIA mzXML files were treated by OpenSWATH [3] with default settings (version 2.2.0). The data was processed as described in Wenguang Shao et al. (Nat. Commun., 2019 [4]), except from the following TRIC parameters: “method: best_overall , realign_method: dIRT, dscore_cutoff: 1, target_fdr: 0.01”.  For quantification purposes, eight medulloblastoma samples acquired independently and representing the four main medulloblastoma subgroups were used as a reference to generate tumor-to-reference ratios. The label free quantification was performed by MSstat in myProMS [5]. Proteotypic peptides were used, with missed cleavages and carbamidomethyl cysteine allowed. A median-based normalization was applied on the total signal to correct XICs between each tumor and the reference.  Proteins with at least three measured peptide ratios and with no more than 25% missing values across the cohort were considered. Differential protein abundance analysis was performed using limma (R package, v3.32.10), fitting linear models (lmFit function), and computing moderated t-statistics with empirical Bayes statistics (eBayes function). P values were adjusted for multiple testing using qvalue (R package, v2.12). Enrichment scores for Reactome UPR pathways and the Elongator protein complex (ELP1-6) were caculated for samples based on gene set enrichment analysis (fgsea v1.2.1 R package). The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) index for all protein-coding genes was calculated using the uco function in seqinr (R package, v3.4). Differences in codon usage bias between two gene sets were calculated using Mann-Whitney U tests (wilcox.test function in R). The strength of codon usage bias (RSCU) was calculated as median difference in RSCU values between two gene sets. The RSCU value is in the absence of any codon usage bias between two gene sets zero. The log2 AA:AG codon usage ratio was calculated by dividing the proportion of AA-ending to AG-ending codons. A pseudocount of one was added to AA and AG codon counts to avoid infinite values.	2019-12-19	"[[""DOI:10.1038/s41586-020-2164-5"",""PMID:32296180""]]"

While biallelic mutations of the SLC26A4 gene, encoding pendrin, causes non-syndromic hearing loss with EVA or Pendred syndrome, a considerable number of patients appear to carry mono-allelic mutation. This suggests faulty pendrin regulatory machinery results in hearing loss. Here we identify EPHA2 as another causative gene of Pendred syndrome with SLC26A4. EphA2 forms a protein complex with pendrin controlling pendrin localization, which is disrupted in some pathogenic forms of pendrin. Moreover, point mutations leading to amino acid substitution in the EPHA2 gene are identified from patients bearing mono-allelic mutation of SLC26A4. Ephrin-B2 binds to EphA2 triggering internalization with pendrin inducing EphA2 autophosphorylation weakly. The identified EphA2 mutants attenuate ephrin-B2- but not ephrin-A1-induced EphA2 internalization with pendrin. Our results uncover an unexpected role of the Eph/ephrin system in epithelial function.

Here, we show that human and mouse monocytes release TGF-β1-transporting vesicles in response to the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. Soluble beta-glucan from Candida albicans binds to complement receptor 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18) on monocytes and induces the release of TGF-β1-transporting vesicles. CR3-dependence is demonstrated using CR3-deficient (CD11b knockout) monocytes generated by CRISPR-CAS9 genome editing and isolated from CR3-deficient (CD11b knockout) mice. Isolated vesicles dampen the pro-inflammatory response in human M1-macrophages as well as in whole blood. Binding of the vesicle-transported TGF-β1 to the TGF-β receptor inhibits IL-1β gene transcription via the SMAD7 pathway in whole blood and induces TGF-β1 transcription in endothelial cells. Inhibition of TGF-β1 relieved the suppression of such proinflammatory effect. Notably, human opsonized apoptotic bodies induce similar TGF-β1-transporting vesicles in monocytes, suggesting that the early immune response is suppressed through this newly identified CR3-dependent anti-inflammatory vesicle pathway.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which nuclear lncRNAs directly contribute to DNA damage responses remain largely unknown. Using RNA antisense purification coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry (RAP-qMS), we found that the lncRNA BGL3 binds to PARP1 and BARD1, exhibiting unexpected roles in homologous recombination. Mechanistically, BGL3 is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by PARP1 at an early time point, which requires its interaction with the DNA-binding domain of PARP1. BGL3 also binds the C-terminal BRCT domain and an internal region (amino acids 127-424) of BARD1, which mediates interaction of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex with its binding partners such as HP1γ and RAD51, resulting in BRCA1/BARD1 retention at DSBs.

The major fraction of complexes I, III and IV are present together in large molecular structures known as respiratory chain supercomplexes. A number of assembly factors have been proposed as required for supercomplex assembly, including the hypoxia inducible gene 1 domain family member HIGD2A. Using gene-edited human cell lines and extensive steady state, translation and affinity enrichment proteomics techniques we show that loss of HIGD2A leads to defects in the de novo biogenesis of mtDNA-encoded COX3, subsequent accumulation of complex IV intermediates and turnover of COX3 partner proteins. Deletion of HIGD2A also leads to defective complex IV activity. The impact of HIGD2A loss on complex IV was not altered by growth under hypoxic conditions, consistent with its role being in basal complex IV assembly. While in the absence of HIGD2A we show that mitochondria do contain an altered supercomplex assembly, we demonstrate it to harbor a crippled complex IV lacking COX3. Our results redefine HIGD2A as a classical assembly factor required for building the COX3 module of complex IV.

Its biogenesis requires the assembly and integration of distinct intermediate modules, mediated by numerous assembly factors. The Mitochondrial Complex I Intermediate Assembly (MCIA) complex, containing assembly factors NDUFAF1, ECSIT, ACAD9, and TMEM126B, is required for building the intermediate ND2-module. The role of the MCIA complex and the involvement of other proteins in the biogenesis of this module is unclear. Cell knockout studies reveal that while each MCIA component is critical for complex I assembly, a hierarchy of stability exists centred on ACAD9. We also identify TMEM186 and COA1 as bona fide components of the MCIA complex with loss of either resulting in MCIA complex defects and reduced complex I assembly. TMEM186 enriches with newly translated ND3, while COA1 enriches with ND2. Our findings provide new functional insights into the essential nature of the MCIA complex in complex I assembly.

2137	PXD012146	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD012146	Functions of the 12 different isoforms of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α)	HNF4α is a nuclear receptor regulating the transcription of genes involved mainly in development, cell differentiation and metabolism. Opposite functions for the two classes of P1 and P2 isoforms of HNF4α have recently been highlighted. These classes include 12 variants of HNF4α that can be expressed by the use of two promoters and by alternative splicing. Until now, the characterization of this transcription factor has ignored this diversity and has remained confined to the study of a fraction of the isoforms. We therefore wanted to clarify the situation by specifically characterizing the transcriptional functions of the 12 isoforms of HNF4α. We have generated for this purpose stable lines expressing each isoform of HNF4α in HCT 116 cells. We analyzed the whole transcriptome associated with each isoform by sequencing RNA, as well as their proteome by a BioID approach coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry. We noted major differences in the transcriptional function of the 12 isoforms. The α4, α5 and α6 isoforms have been characterized for the first time, and show a greatly reduced transcriptional potential. We have shown that these isoforms are unable to recognize the consensus response element of HNF4α. The α1 and α2 isoforms are the most potent regulators of gene expression, while the α3 isoform exhibits significantly reduced activity. Several transcription factors and coregulators have been identified as potential specific partners for certain HFH4α isoforms. The IRF-2BP2 co-repressor interacts specifically with isoforms which include the long form of the F domain of HNF4α. This specific interaction could explain the large number of genes modulated negatively by α1 and α2 compared to α3. The analysis integrating the vast amount of transcriptomic and proteomic data allows the identification of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms specific to certain isoforms, demonstrating the importance of considering all isoforms which can have diverse functions.

The ratios identified in only one of the three replicas for each experiment were eliminated. The ratios identified in two of the three replicas were eliminated when they were considered to be too divergent, ie when the standard deviation was greater than the average of the two enrichment ratios. Outliers for the ratios measured in the three replicas were detected using the Grubbs test at a value of α = 0.05 and then eliminated. Following this sorting, proteins for which no ratio was calculated in at least one experiment were removed.

As well as APOBEC3G and its homologues, however, we have recently discovered that Vif is also able to degrade the PPP2R5 family of regulatory subunits of key cellular phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R5A-E) (Greenwood et al., 2016; Naamati et al., 2019). We now identify amino acid polymorphisms at positions 31 and 128 of HIV-1 Vif which selectively regulate the degradation of PPP2R5 family proteins. These residues covary across HIV-1 viruses in vivo, favouring depletion of PPP2R5A-E. Through analysis of point mutants and naturally occurring Vif variants, we further show that degradation of PPP2R5 family subunits is both necessary and sufficient for Vif-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest. Antagonism of PP2A by HIV-1 Vif is therefore independent of APOBEC3 family proteins, and regulates cell cycle progression in HIV-infected cells.

AML is a heterogeneous disease in which molecules associated to kinase signaling are frequently mutated. However, no kinase inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of this malignancy. Thus, patient stratification requires new molecular profiling techniques in addition of to the current sequencing strategies. We have used a multiomics approach that combines proteomics, phosphoproteomics, mass cytometry and DNA sequencing to classify primary AML cells derived from 36 patients. Comprehensive integrative analysis identified molecular signatures based on phosphopeptide abundance or surface marker expression that separate AML cases according to their differentiation status. Differentiated cells presented a particular pattern of protein phosphorylation, an enrichment in the activity of several kinases and a higher sensitivity to PAK, MEK and PKC/FLT3 inhibitors. In addition, mutations in proteins closely linked to kinase signaling were more frequent on differentiated cells. Interestingly the set of patients with differentiated cells as clustered by marker expression signatures showed an increased overall survival in our set of patients and in the TCGA database registered cohort. Thus, molecular differentiation signatures could be used as prognosis and drug response markers in order to implement the application of precision medicine in AML patients.

There are also indications of its role in cancer progression, especially in breast cancer, but the molecular mechanisms behind this and the cell cycle independent functions of MASTL are poorly understood. Regulation of cell adhesion and actin dynamics play a central role in governing cell contractility, migration and cell division in normal and cancer cells. Here, we identify MASTL as regulator of cell contractility and activator of the transcriptional co-activator MTRF-A. We show that depletion of MASTL increases cell contact with the extracellular matrix, reduces contractile actin stress fibers in normal and breast cancer cells. Importantly, depletion of MASTL also leads to strongly impairs motility of breast cancer cells. Our transcriptome and proteome profiling revealed that depletion of MASTL impairs transcription and expression of several MRTF-A target genes implicated in cellular movement and actomyosin contraction, including Rho Guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (GEF-H1, ARHGEF2) and tropomyosin 4.2 (TPM4). Mechanistically, we find that MASTL is necessary for serum-induced activation of SRF/MTRF-A transcription and that exogenous expression of GEF-H1 in MASTL depleted cells is sufficient to restore cell contractility. Taken together, our results suggest that MASTL is a previously undescribed key regulator of cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton through transcriptional control of multiple adhesion and actin cytoskeleton regulating genes with key roles in contractility, cell adhesion and migration.  MASTL (Microtubule associated serine-threonine kinase-like) is a relatively recently identified mitotic accelerator. There are also indications of its role in cancer progression, especially in breast cancer, but the molecular mechanisms behind this and the cell cycle independent functions of MASTL are poorly understood. Regulation of cell adhesion and actin dynamics play a central role in cell migration, morphology and cancer progression, but the role of MASTL in these processes has not been evaluated. Here, we show that depletion of MASTL increases cell contact with the extracellular matrix in breast cancer cells. Importantly, depletion of MASTL also leads to reduction of contractile actin stress fibers and decreased cell motility. Further, our transcriptome and proteome profiling revealed that mechanistically depletion of MASTL impairs transcription and expression of regulators of cellular movement and actomyosin contraction, including Rho Guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (GEF-H1, ARHGEF2) and tropomyosin 4.2 (TPM4). Further, we show that the transcriptional changes are caused by defectiveness of the serum response factor (SRF) signalling. Importantly, this study reveals advanced role for MASTL in interphase cells that activates a transcriptional program strongly impacting on the expression of regulators of cellular motility and actomyosin contraction.

Here, by scRNA-sequencing 28,337 murine choroidal ECs (CECs) and sprouting CNV-ECs, we constructed a taxonomy to characterize their heterogeneity. Comparison with murine lung tumor ECs (TECs) revealed congruent marker gene expression by distinct EC phenotypes across tissues and diseases, suggesting similar angiogenic mechanisms. Trajectory inference of CNV-ECs revealed that differentiation of venous to angiogenic ECs was accompanied by metabolic transcriptome plasticity. EC phenotypes displayed metabolic transcriptome heterogeneity. Hypothesizing that conserved genes are more important, we used an integrated analysis, based on congruent transcriptome analysis, CEC-tailored genome scale metabolic modeling, and gene expression meta-analysis in multiple cross-species datasets, followed by functional validation, to identify the top-ranking metabolic targets SQLE and ALDH18A1, involved in EC proliferation and collagen production, respectively, as novel angiogenic targets.  The effect of SQLE and ALDH18A1 silencing in ECs was investigated by transcriptomics and proteomics analysis.

Such malignancies regularly carry mutational signatures that conform to off-target induction of uracil by the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, or downstream processing of uracil.  . HDACi suppress thymidylate synthase increasing the cellular dUTP/dTTP ratio and leading to increased pressure on uracil repair machinery due to misincorporated uracil lesions. To investigate potential effect upon other enzymes involved in genomic uracil induction and processing, Jurkat (T-cell lymphoma) and SUDHL5 (B-cell lymphoma) cells were treated with pan-HDACi SAHA prior to SILAC based MS/MS investigation. HDACi treatment mediated significant differential expression of xx and xx proteins in Jurkat and SUDHL5, respectively, and had a substantial impact upon enzymes involved in in pyrimidine metabolism. Surprisingly, uracil N-glycosylase, UNG, was strongly downregulated by HDACi treatment. Further analysis in HEK and HeLa cells revealed that HDACis induce specific loss of the nuclear isoform UNG2 independent of transcription and cell-cycle alterations. More than 80% of UNG2 is degraded proteasomally after 24 hours treatment with SAHA, MS275, Valproate or Na-butyrate, indicating a universal ability of HDACis to mediate loss of UNG2.  Targeted MS/MS analysis in HEK cells against a panel of proteins involved in DNA repair, translesion synthesis and nucleotide metabolism, revealed that UNG2 was the most pronounced differentially expressed among these after HDACi treatment. 48 hour treatment lead to a 30-40% increase in uracil lesions in the nuclear genome of HeLa and HEK cells and MS275 treatment in murine CH12F3 cell line mediated robust UNG2-loss accompanied by reduced class switch recombination. Furthermore, our analysis identified the PCNA-associated factor PAF15 among the downregulated proteins. PAF15 is overexpressed in many cancers and suppress TLS by inducing double monoubiquitinylation of PCNA and recruitment of the replicative polymerases. In summary, our findings demonstrate that HDAC inhibition affects the levels of proteins involved in DNA base excision repair, translesion synthesis and pyrimidine metabolism. These findings are important for a wide range of clinical applications of HDACi, such as in rheumatology, HIV-, and cancer treatment.

Although complete remission (CR) is achieved for the majority of the patients after induction and consolidation therapies, nearly two-thirds relapse within a short interval. Therefore, understanding of the biological factors that determine relapse has become a major interest in clinical AML. In order to identify the proteins and their phosphorylated modifications involved in AML relapse, we performed a global proteome and phosphoproteome study by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with primary cells from 41 AML patients at time of diagnosis that were defined as RELAPSE or REL_FREE according to their relapse status after a 5-year clinical follow-up post diagnosis. Our findings showed that the diagnostic sample of patients relapsing had increased levels of RNA processing and decreased expression of V-ATPases proteins along with CDKs and CSK2 activities. LC-MS/MS-based results were further validated with cell proliferation assays using V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, CSK2 inhibitor CX-4945, CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib and CDK2/7/9 inhibitor SNS-032.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of intact tissue has improved the understanding of these processes, by providing an in-depth view of the human liver proteome. However, the predominance of parenchymal cells, i.e. hepatocytes, means that the total tissue proteome mainly reflects hepatocyte expression. In this study, we therefore used quantitative label-free proteomic analysis to analyze the proteomes of the major parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell types in the human liver, i.e. hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatic stellate cells. We found that our data recapitulated specific functional differences between cell types, meaning that it can be used to reliably probe various aspects of cellular interplay.

Disulfide formation involves both an oxidative pathway for their insertion and a reductive pathway to remove incorrectly formed disulfides.  Reduction of these disulfides is critical for correct folding and degradation of misfolded proteins.  Previously, we showed that the reductive pathway is driven by NADPH generated in the cytosol.  Here, by reconstituting the pathway using purified proteins and ER microsomal membranes, we demonstrate that the thioredoxin reductase system provides the minimal cytosolic components required for reducing proteins within the ER lumen.  In particular, saturation of the pathway and its protease sensitivity demonstrates the requirement for a membrane protein to shuttle electrons from the cytosol to the ER lumen.  These results provide compelling evidence for the critical role of the cytosol in regulating ER redox homeostasis to ensure correct protein folding and to facilitate the degradation of misfolded ER proteins.

Activation of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) by its cognate chemokine ligands, including CCL2, plays a central role in recruitment of monocytes in several inflammatory diseases. In this study, we used phosphoproteomics to enable unbiased characterization of the signaling network resulting from CCL2 activation of CCR2. Using data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry, both the proteome and phosphoproteome were quantified for FlpIn-HEK293T cells stably expressing CCR2, at six time points after activation with CCL2, in comparison with untreated cells. Differential expression analysis identified 699 significantly regulated phosphorylation sites located on 441 proteins. As expected, many of these proteins participate in canonical signal transduction pathways and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, including numerous guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). In addition, we identified regulated phosphorylation sites in numerous proteins that exert functions in the nucleus, including several constituents of the nuclear pore complex.

State-of-the-art approaches are based on the introduction of a linker between the targeted amino acid and the alkyne, and still present limitations of either reactivity, selectivity or adduct stability. Herein, we present a new ethynylation method of cysteine residues based on the use of ethynylbenziodoxolone (EBX) reagents. In contrast to other approaches, the acetylene group is directly introduced onto the thiol group of cysteine and can be used in one-pot in a copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) for further functionalization. Labeling proceeded with reaction rates comparable or higher than the most often used iodoacetamide on peptides or maleimide on the antibody trastuzumab. Under optimized conditions, high cysteine selectivity was observed. The reagents were also used in living cells for cysteine proteomic profiling and displayed a much-improved coverage of the cysteinome compared to previously reported iodoacetamide or hypervalent iodine-reagent based probes. Fine-tuning of the EBX reagents allowed optimization of their reactivity and physical properties for the desired application.

The functions of lncRNAs are often mediated through associated gene regulatory activities, but how lncRNAs are distinguished from other RNAs and recruit effector complexes is unclear. Here we utilize the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to investigate how lncRNAs engage silencing activities to regulate gene expression in cis.  We find that invasion of lncRNA transcription into the downstream gene body incorporates a cryptic intron required for repression of that gene.  Our analyses show that lncRNAs containing cryptic introns are targeted by the conserved Pir2ARS2 protein in association with splicing factors, which recruit RNA processing and chromatin modifying activities involved in gene silencing.  Pir2 and splicing machinery are broadly required for gene repression.  Our finding that human ARS2 also interacts with splicing factors suggests a conserved mechanism mediates gene repression through cryptic introns within lncRNAs.

The mechanisms through which ATO function and how increased levels of ATO adversely affect the cell are not fully characterized though they involve the SUMOylation, the ubiquitylation and the degradation of the PML/RARα oncoprotein through the PML moiety. Changes in protein SUMOylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitylation were profiled using large-scale proteomic workflows on HEK293 cells following exposure to typical (1 μM) or elevated (10 μM) ATO for 4h to understand the mechanism that underlies the cytotoxicity induced with important ATO levels. Our analyses revealed that 88 proteins displayed divergent SUMOylation with elevated ATO compared to the lower dose, where the latter caused changes in SUMOylation of 4 proteins, including PML. Some of these differing SUMOylation events occurred on known substrates of caspase-3. A similar phenomenon was observed in the phosphoproteomic studies, where 48 proteins were specifically regulated with elevated ATO levels, while low ATO doses barely altered the phosphoproteome. Elevated levels of ATO cause the erroneous SUMOylation and phosphorylation of a vast amount of substrates, which may be responsible for its cytotoxic effects.

Extensive vesiculation impairs function and survival of red blood cells after transfusion, and microvesicles contribute to transfusion reactions. The triggers and mechanism of microvesicle generation are largely unknown. In this study, we combined morphological, immunochemical, proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic analyses in order to obtain an integrated understanding of the mechanisms underlying microvesicle generation during storage of red blood cell concentrates. Our data indicate that changes in membrane organization, triggered by altered protein conformation, constitute the main mechanism of vesiculation, and precede changes in lipid organization. The resulting selective accumulation of membrane components in microvesicles is accompanied by the recruitment of plasma proteins involved in inflammation and coagulation. Our data may serve as a basis for further dissection of the fundamental mechanisms of red blood cell aging and vesiculation, for identifying the cause-effect relationship between blood bank storage and transfusion complications, and for assessing the role of microvesicles in pathologies affecting red blood cells.

With currently available therapies, cure of advanced and metastatic ccRCC is achieved only in rare cases. Here, we developed a workflow integrating different -omics technologies to identify ccRCC-specific HLA-presented peptides as potential drug targets for ccRCC immunotherapy. We analyzed frequent ccRCC-specific peptides by MS-based HLA ligandomics of 55 ccRCC tumors (cohort 1), paired non-tumor renal tissues and 158 benign tissues from other organs. Pathways enriched in ccRCC compared to its cell type of origin were identified by transcriptome and gene set enrichment analyses in 51 tumor tissues of the same cohort. To retrieve a list of candidate target genes with involvement in ccRCC pathogenesis, ccRCC-specific pathway genes were intersected with the source genes of tumor-exclusive peptides. The candidates were validated in an independent cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA KIRC, n=452), yielding 113 candidate genes. DNA methylation (TCGA KIRC, n=273), and somatic mutations (TCGA KIRC, n=392), as well as correlations with tumor metabolites (cohort 1, n=30) and immune-oncological markers (cohort 1, n=37) were analyzed to refine regulatory and functional involvements of candidates. Immunogenicity analysis identified candidate epitopes able to activate native CD8+ T cells. Functional analysis of EGLN3, a candidate with frequent ccRCC-specific immunogenic peptides, revealed possible tumor-promoting functions. Integration of HLA ligandomics, transcriptomics, genetic and epigenetic data leads to the identification of novel functionally relevant therapeutic targets for ccRCC immunotherapy. Validation of the identified targets is now mandatory to expand the treatment landscape of ccRCC.

Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to immunosurveillance and first-line defense in the control of tumor growth and metastasis diffusion. NKEVs are constitutively secreted, are biologically active, reflect the protein and genetic repertoire of their originating cells and exert anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. NKEVs from tumor-conditioned NK cells interact with naïve NK cells promoting their cytotoxic activity. In cancer NK cells exhibit profound defects in degranulation ability, a status probably reflected by their NKEVs. Hence, NKEVs could contribute to improve cancer therapy by interacting with tumor and/or immune cells at the same time sensing the actual NK cell status in cancer patients.  Here we investigated the role of NKEVs in stimulating the immune system and developed an immune enzymatic test (NKExoELISA) to sense the systemic NK cell status by measuring plasma NK-derived exosomes through combined capture of exosomes, expressing typical EV (tsg101) and NK cell (CD56) markers. We analyzed by LC-MS/MS the protein content from NKEVs evaluating  proteins differentially expressed in exosomes (NKExo), vescicles (NKMV)  and total cell extract (Tot extr) from parental NK cells. Proteomic data confirmed the presence of many EV markers and detected several proteins involved in immune response, cell adhesion and complement biological processes.

Proteins in FFPE material are stable over decades but their efficient extraction and streamlined analysis by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has so far proven challenging. Here, we describe an MS-based proteomic workflow for quantitative profiling of large FFPE tissue cohorts directly from pathology glass slides. We demonstrate broad applicability of the workflow to clinical pathology specimens and variable sample amounts, including low-input cancer tissue isolated by laser microdissection. Using state-of-the-art data dependent acquisition (DDA) and data independent (DIA) MS workflows, we consistently quantify a large part of the proteome in 100 min single-run analyses. In an adenoma cohort comprising more than 100 samples, total work up took less than a day. We observed a moderate trend towards lower protein identifications in long-term stored samples (>15 years) but clustering into distinct proteomic subtypes was independent of archival time. Our results underline the great promise of FFPE tissues for patient phenotyping using unbiased proteomics and prove the feasibility of analyzing large tissue cohorts in a robust, timely and streamlined manner.

From a set of PTC patients whose tumor did not harbour any BRAF or RAS mutations, a 35 years old male patient’s normal, primary tumor and lymph node (LN) metastatic tissues was subjected to genomics and proteomics analysis. By RNA-seq analysis, we identified a novel RET rearrangement involving exons 1-4 from the 5’ end of the Trk fused Gene (TFG) fused to the 3’ end of RET tyrosine kinase leading to a TFG-RET fusion which transforms immortalized human thyroid cells in a kinase dependent manner. Further, TFG-RET oncogene oligomerises in a PB1 domain dependent manner and consistently, mutation of the oligomerisation interface led to the inhibition of RET-mediated oncogenic transformation. Quantitative proteomic analysis of the same samples revealed the upregulation of proteins involved in the ubiquitination machinery including HECT carrying E3 Ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 and DUBs like USP9X and UBP7 in the tumor and LN metastatic lesions. We further identify that expression of TFG-RET led to the upregulation of HUWE1.  Further, in a cohort of PTC patients, we observed higher expression of HUWE1, USP9X and USP7 in the tumor and metastatic lesions, when compared to the matched normal tissue. Transient knockdown of HUWE1, USP9X and USP7 affected viability and proliferation of TFG-RET transformed cells. Consistently, inhibition of RET, HUWE1 and DUBs by small molecule inhibitors significantly reduced RET-mediated oncogenesis. Apart from unveiling a novel oncogenic RET fusion in PTCs, our data may open a novel avenue of targeting ubiquitin signaling machinery in human PTCs.

We have previously reported that chromodomain Y-like transcription corepressor CDYL acts as a crotonyl-CoA hydratase and negatively regulates histone Kcr. However, the global crotonylome of CDYL-regulated Kcr on non-histone substrates remains unclear. Using proteome-wide quantitative Kcr analysis, we identified 14,311 Kcr sites across 3,734 proteins in HeLa cells, providing by far the largest crotonylome data set from a single study. Upon depletion of CDYL, 1,141 Kcr sites from 759 proteins were increased by more than 1.5 fold, and 933 Kcr sites from 528 proteins were decreased by more than 0.67 fold. Upregulated crotonylome alterations upon CDYL depletion include components from diverse cellular pathways such as RNA splicing, DNA replication, and amino acid metabolism. Specifically, CDYL regulates K88 and K379 of crotonylation on RPA1, which affects its binding to other DNA repair factors including BLM, DNA2L, RAD50 and WRN. We showed evidence that CDYL-mediated RPA1 crotonylation is critical for the homologous recombination (HR) repair of camptothecin (CPT)-induced DNA damage. Together, our results provide a broad lysine crotonylome in response to CDYL and shed new light on the role of RPA1 Kcr in DNA repair, implicating functional importance of Kcr on non-histone substrates in diverse cellular processes.

More recently, proteomics analyses have shown that per-O-acetylated MCRs can directly and chemically react with cysteine residues in lysates and potentially cells, drawing into question the physiological relevance of the labeling. Here, we report robust cellular labeling by Ac42AzMan but not the structurally-similar Ac44AzGal. However, the levels of background chemical-labeling of cell lysates by both reporters are low and identical. We then characterized Ac42AzMan labeling and found that the vast majority of the labeling occurs on intracellular proteins but that this MCR is not converted to previously characterized reporters of intracellular O-GlcNAc modification. Additionally, we used IsoTag proteomics to show that essentially all of the Ac42AzMan labeling is on cysteine residues. Given the implications this result has for the identification of intracellular O-GlcNAc modifications using MCRs, we then performed a meta-analysis of the potential O-GlcNAcylated proteins identified by different techniques. We found that many of the proteins identified by MCRs have also been found by other methods. Finally, we randomly selected four proteins that had only been characterized as O-GlcNAcylated by MCRs and showed that half of them were indeed modified.

Recent reports suggest that non-canonical cancer HLAp could be immunogenic but their identification requires highly sensitive and accurate mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteogenomics approaches. Here, we present a novel MS-based analytical pipeline that can precisely characterize the non-canonical HLAp repertoire, incorporating whole exome sequencing, bulk and single cell transcriptomics, ribosome profiling, and a combination of two MS/MS search tools. This approach results in the accurate identification of hundreds of shared and tumor-specific non-canonical HLAp. Albeit often at low levels and in distinct subpopulations of cells, numerous non-canonical HLAp are shared across tumors. This analytical platform holds great promise for the discovery of novel cancer antigens for cancer immunotherapy.

Both Andromeda and Comet provided good results in preliminary tests, their scoring methods performed well for HLAp peptides, and they allowed searching for peptides with and without variants. Andromeda matched the MS/MS spectra of each sample against their personalized reference libraries (mentioned above). Similarly, the variants were annotated in the PEFF format (http://www.psidev.info/peff) for Comet. Both search tools were run with the same principal search parameters: precursor mass tolerance 20ppm, MS/MS fragment tolerance 0.02 Da, peptide length 8-15 for HLA-I only and 8-25 for HLA-I and HLA-II peptides, Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (Protein N-term) as variable modifications and no fixed modifications. A PSM FDR of 3% was used for Andromeda as a first filter, and nonc reference sequences were loaded into the “proteogenomics fasta files” module for separate FDR calculations for prot and nonc sequences. To assure that nonc peptide sequences do not match other protein coding genes, all peptides found by Andromeda or Comet were aligned against the UniProt (www.uniprot.org) sequence database (human reviewed sequences with isoforms, downloaded 18/12/2018), where leucine and iso-leucines were treated as equal since they are not distinguishable by mass spectrometry. If peptides were found matching standard UniProt sequences, they were assigned as prot with the UniProt IDs. However, we assigned and kept TE peptide sequences that matched  annotated TEs that were integrated into the human reference in UniProt.  As schematically described in Supplementary Figure 1, the Comet FDR calculation was done separately for prot and nonc PSMs with an in-house software written in Java, which utilizes the MzJava class library77. All PSMs resulting from the Comet search, including the decoy PSMs (decoy hits originating from reversed sequences), were split into three sublists with PSMs of charge (Z) 1, 2, and charge 3 or higher. The three Comet scores XCorr, deltaCn and spScore were considered. It has been shown that when feature vectors are partitioned into different groups, group-wise local FDR (lFDR) calculation provides the most sensitive decision boundaries, for controlling the global FDR78. Therefore, the 3D space (XCorr, deltaCn and spScore) was partitioned into small cells (40 intervals in each dimension) and the lFDR was estimated for each cell. We used the following equation to calculate the lFDR:  (1) lFDR(x,Z)=(π_0 p(x│Z,H=0))/(π_0 p(x│Z,H=0)+π_1 p(x│Z,H=1) )=(1+π_1/π_0 ∙(p(x│Z,H=1))/(p(x│Z,H=0) ))^(-1) =(1+π_1/π_0  γ(x,Z))^(-1)         where π_0 and π_1 are the class probabilities for true (H=1) and wrong (H=0) PSMs, and  p(x│Z,H=0,1) are the probability distributions for feature vector  x=(XCorr,deltaCn,spScore) of PSMs with charge Z. The probability ratio γ(x,Z) is estimated for every cell and charge using all the target and decoy PSMs. The π_1⁄π_0  ratios are calculated for the nonc and prot groups separately and then the π_1⁄π_0  ratios are plugged into Equation (1). This way the lFDR values are calculated for every cell for both groups. For each cell, the number of wrong hits (n0) is set to the number of decoy hits in that cell, while the number of true hits (n1) is set to the number of target hits minus n0. These counts are then smoothed by replacing the values to average counts of the neighboring cells. Then γ(x,Z)=n_1⁄n_0  or γ(x,Z)=1 if n0 = 0. The target and decoy PSMs are further split into nonc and prot PSMs. Since there usually are not enough PSMs to estimate γ(x,Z) for the nonc group, γ(x,Z) is taken from all PSMs but π_1⁄π_0  is adapted for each group. Therefore, it is assumed that the score distributions are the same for each group, but that the ratio of true to wrong PSMs may change. The π_1⁄π_0  ratios are calculated for the nonc and prot groups separately and then the π_1⁄π_0  ratios are plugged into Equation (1). This way the lFDR values are calculated for every cell for both groups separately. The π_1⁄π_0  ratio in the nonc group is relatively smaller than the prot π_1⁄π_0  ratio, because the nonc database is larger and mostly consists of peptides that are not present in the sample.  This will lead to a larger nonc lFDR value, and to a more conservative filtering of nonc PSMs. Finally, the lFDR threshold is adjusted to allow a global FDR of 1% for the nonc and prot groups. PSMs from both search tools were combined and only the intersection, meaning PSMs with identical Comet and Andromeda matches (same peptide sequence with the same modification) were retained.	2020-01-17	"[[""DOI:10.1038/s41467-020-14968-9"",""PMID:32157095""]]"

Here, we determine epigenetic changes and genes involved in hemispheric asymmetry in the healthy and PD brain. Neurons of healthy individuals exhibit numerous hemispheric differences in DNA methylation, affecting genes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. In PD patients, hemispheric asymmetry in DNA methylation is even greater and involves many PD risk genes. Moreover, the lateralization of clinical PD symptoms involves epigenetic, transcriptional, and proteomic differences across hemispheres that affect neurodevelopment, immune activation, and synaptic transmission. In aging, healthy neurons demonstrate a progressive loss of hemisphere asymmetry in epigenomes that is amplified in PD. For PD patients, a long disease course is associated with retaining more hemispheric asymmetry in neuronal epigenomes. Hemispheric differences in epigenetic gene regulation are prevalent in neurons and may affect the progression and symptoms of PD.

2202	PXD016192	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD016192	Tandem Mass Tag approach utilizing pervanadate BOOST channels delivers deeper quantitative characterization of the tyrosine phosphoproteome	Dynamic tyrosine phosphorylation is fundamental to a myriad of cellular processes.  However, the inherently low abundance of tyrosine phosphorylation in the proteome and the inefficient enrichment of phosphotyrosine(pTyr)-containing peptides has led to poor pTyr peptide identification and quantitation, critically hindering researchers’ ability to elucidate signaling pathways regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation in systems where cellular material is limited. The most popular approaches to wide-scale characterization of the tyrosine phosphoproteome use pTyr enrichment with pan-specific, anti-pTyr antibodies from a large amount of starting material.  Methods that decrease the amount of starting material and increase the characterization depth of the tyrosine phosphoproteome while maintaining quantitative accuracy and precision would enable the discovery of tyrosine phosphorylation networks in rarer cell populations. To achieve these goals, a novel method leveraging the multiplexing capability of tandem mass tags (TMT) and the use of trigger channels – cells treated with the promiscuous tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (PV) – selectively increased the relative abundance of pTyr-containing peptides. After PV facilitated selective fragmentation of pTyr-containing peptides, TMT reporter ions delivered sensitive quantitation of each peptide for the experimental samples while the quantitation from PV trigger channels was ignored. This method yielded up to 6.3-fold boost in quantification depth of statistically significant data derived from contrived ratios, compared to TMT without trigger channels or intensity-based label-free (LF) quantitation while maintaining quantitative accuracy and precision, allowing quantitation of over 2300 unique pTyr peptides from only 1 mg of T cell receptor-stimulated Jurkat T cells. The trigger channel strategy can potentially be applied in analyses of other post-translational modifications where treatments that broadly boost the levels of those modifications across the proteome are available.

MS/MS spectra were searched against a human Uniprot database (Homo sapiens, 8/29/2017) comprised of 71,567 forward protein sequences and an equal number of reverse decoy entries. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was set on peptide spectrum match (PSM) employing a target-decoy approach. The following parameters were used: precursor ion tolerance of 3 ppm, ITMS MS/MS fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.5 Da, trypsin enzyme cleavage specificity, three maximum possible missed cleavages permitted, a minimum peptide length of 6 amino acids, maximum peptide mass of 4800 Da, fixed modification of carbamidomethylation on cysteine, variable modifications of oxidation on methionine and phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine, and a maximum of 5 modifications per peptide. “Match-between-runs” was enabled for label-free data with the default retention time window of 2 minutes. For TMT samples, additional modifications included TMT-11plex labels on N-termini and lysine residues, where reporter ion MS3 with reporter mass tolerance of 0.005 Da was defined. All downstream analyses and graphical plotting were performed in R or Microsoft Excel based on MaxQuant output files. The rationale of the experimental design is described in detail in the results section. Equal amounts of peptide were used in each labeling reaction so that the amount of peptide and label remained proportional in separate labeling steps. Three technical replicates each of 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg and 1.0 mg labeled peptides using the protein concentration derived from BCA Protein Assay were combined to create the contrived ratios of 10:1, 10:3, and 3:1. Technical, not biological, replicates were chosen to minimize biological sample variation that would otherwise hinder our ability to determine the quantitative accuracy of this experiment from predetermined contrived ratios, which is one of the core elements in the data analysis. LF experiments with a similar setup were included as a control alongside TMT experiments as a comparison. Similar amounts of peptide input were used for pTyr peptide enrichment in all comparisons to maintain approximately equal sample-to-bead ratio. Both TMT and LF experiments are limited to approximately equal instrument time. Each TMT experiment had a total of twelve fractionated LC/MS runs, whereas LF experiment had a total of eleven unfractionated LC/MS runs. LF LC/MS runs had a similar or greater total number of MS and MS/MS scans compared to TMT experiments, making both LF and TMT experiments highly comparable. To determine statistical significance, Welch’s two sample t-test was used to calculate p values from ratios containing all three intensity values present for both numerator and denominator (no missing values). To correct for multiple-hypothesis testing, the Benjamini–Hochberg (FDR) procedure was used to adjust p values to obtain q values15. Q values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Whenever appropriate, values were corrected for heteroscedasticity to allow for parametric testing by log transformation. Coefficient of determination of a linear regression model was calculated to examine the reproducibility and correlation of peptide intensities between replicates in a pairwise fashion.	2020-02-27	"[[""PMID:0"",""DOI:10.1074/MCP.TIR119.001865""],[""DOI:10.1074/mcp.tir119.001865"",""PMID:32071147""]]"

Segments form from the rostral end of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) with a periodicity that is regulated by the segmentation clock. The segmentation clock is a molecular oscillator that exhibits dynamic clock gene expression across the PSM with a periodicity that matches somite formation. Notch signalling is crucial to this process. Altering Notch intracellular domain (NICD) stability affects both the clock period and somite size. However, the mechanism by which NICD stability is regulated in this context is unclear. We identified a highly conserved site crucial for NICD recognition by the SCF E3 ligase, which targets NICD for degradation. We demonstrate both CDK1 and CDK2 can phosphorylate NICD in the domain where this crucial residue lies and that NICD levels vary in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Inhibiting CDK1 or CDK2 activity increases NICD levels both in vitro and in vivo, leading to a delay of clock gene oscillations and an increase in somite size.

SARS-CoV-2 infection has a mortality rate of 3.4% among confirmed cases, and there are currently no effective antiviral molecules or vaccines for its treatment or prevention. The search for effective antiviral treatments has recently highlighted host-directed strategies, however besides data describing viral interactions with cell surface receptors and activating proteases, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To shed light on the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells, we have utilized affinity-purification mass spectrometry to globally profile physical host protein interactions for 26 viral proteins encoded in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, identifying 332 high confidence interactions. Among the human proteins, we identify many druggable human proteins targeted by existing FDA approved drugs that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays.

The anthraquinone Rhein was examined for its anti-fibrotic potency to mitigate cardiac fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT). Primary human ventricular cardiac fibroblasts were subjected to hypoxia and characterized with proteomics, transcriptomics and cell functional techniques. Knowledge based analyses of the omics data revealed a modulation of fibrosis-associated pathways and cell cycle due to Rhein administration during hypoxia, whereas p53 and p21 were identified as upstream regulators involved in the manifestation of cardiac fibroblast phenotypes. Mechanistically, Rhein-mediated cellular effects were linked to the histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent acetylation status of p53 a posttranslational modification that acts protein stabilizing. Direct enzymatic testing revealed an inhibitory potency of Rhein for HDAC classes I/II. Functionally, Rhein inhibited collagen contraction in response to protein abundance of SMAD7, thus demonstrating its anti-fibrotic property in cardiac remodeling. In conclusion, this study identifies Rhein as a novel potent HDAC inhibitor and provides evidence that Rhein may contribute to the treatment of cardiac fibrosis as anti-fibrotic agent. As readily available drug with approved safety, repurposing of Rhein constitutes a promising potential therapeutic approach in the supplemental and protective intervention of cardiac fibrosis.

After clinical suspicion of this disorder, including progressive retinitis pigmentosa and polyneuropathy, Refsum disease is biochemically diagnosed by elevated levels of phytanic acid in plasma and tissues of the patient. To date, no cure exists for Refsum disease, but phytanic acid levels in patients can be reduced by plasmapheresis and a strict diet. In recent years, computational models have become valuable tools to provide insight into the complex behaviour of metabolic networks. Besides the comprehensive models that contain all known metabolic reactions within the human body, several tissue- and cell-type-specific models have been developed. However, while systems biology approaches are widely used for complex diseases, only few studies have been published for inborn errors of metabolism. In this study, we reconstructed a fibroblast-specific genome-scale model based on the recently published, FAD-curated model, based on Recon3D reconstruction. We used transcriptomics, exo-metabolomics, and proteomics data, which we obtained from healthy controls and Refsum disease patient fibroblasts incubated with phytol, a precursor of phytanic acid. Our model correctly represents the metabolism of phytanic acid and displays fibroblast-specific metabolic functions. Using this model, we investigated the metabolic phenotype of Refsum disease at the genome scale, and we studied the effect of phytanic acid on cell metabolism. We identified 20 metabolites that were predicted to discriminate between Healthy and Refsum’s Disease patients, whereof several with a link to amino acid metabolism. Ultimately, these insights in metabolic changes may provide leads for pathophysiology and therapy.

It is revealed that NCL strongly binds to long-loop (9-5 nt) G4 whilst interacting weakly with the shorter variants (loop < 3nt). Photocrosslinking experiments using 5-bromouracil (BrdU) modified sequences further confirmed the loop-length dependency thereby indicating that the CEB25-WT (9nt) is the best G4 substrate. Quantitative proteomic analysis (LC-MS/MS) of the photocrosslinking product(s) obtained with NCL bound to this sequence enabled the identification of one contact site within the 9nt loop. The protein fragment identified is located in the helix of the RBD2 domain of NCL, shedding light on the role of this structural element in the G4-loop recognition. Then, the ability of a panel of benchmark G4 ligands to prevent the NCL/G4 interaction was explored. It was found that only the most potent ligand PhenDC3 is able to inhibit NCL binding, thereby suggesting that the terminal guanine quartet is also a strong determinant of G4 recognition, putatively through interaction with the RGG domain. This study puts forward the molecular mechanism by which NCL recognizes G4-containing long loops and leads to propose a model implying a concerted action of RBD2 and RGG domains to achieve specific G4 recognition via a dual loop-quartet interaction.

The exact mechanism behind dopaminergic cell death is still not completely understood and, so far, no cure or neuroprotective treatment for PD is available. Recent studies have brought attention to the wide array of bioactive molecules produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), generally referred to as the secretome. Herein, we evaluated whether human MSCs-bone marrow derived (hBMSCs) secretome would be beneficial in a PD pre-clinical model, when compared directly with cell transplantation of hBMSCs alone. We used a 6-hydroxydpomanie (6-OHDA) rat PD model, and motor behavior was evaluated at different time points after treatments (1, 4 and 7 weeks). The impact of the treatments in the recovery of DA neurons was estimated by determining TH-positive neuronal densities in the substantia nigra and fibers in the striatum, respectively, at the end of the behavioral characterization. Furthermore, we determined the effect of the hBMSCs secretome on the neuronal survival of human neural progenitors in vitro, and characterized the secretome through proteomic-based approaches. This work demonstrates that the injection of hBMSCs secretome potentiated the histological recovery of DA neurons, when compared to transplantation of hBMSCs themselves, a fact that probably explains the improved behavioral performance of secretome-injected animals in the staircase test. Moreover, we observed that hBMSCs secretome induces higher levels of in vitro neuronal differentiation. Finally, the proteomic analysis revealed that hBMSCs secrete a variety of important exosome-related molecules such as those related with the ubiquitin-proteasome and histone systems. Overall, this work provided important insights on the potential use of hBMSCs secretome as a therapeutic tool for PD, and further confirms the importance of the secreted molecules rather than the transplantation of hBMSCs for the observed positive effects. These could be likely through normalization of defective processes in PD, namely proteostasis or altered gene transcription, which lately can lead to neuroprotective effects.

Only proteins with at least two confidently identified peptides were considered as positive identifications. Peptide’s confidence was assessed by a False Discovery Analysis (FDR) and a minimum of 99% confidence (less than 1% FDR) was used to select the peptides. Three biological replicates of secretome were processed, and proteins that were just identified in a single biological replicate were not considered for analysis. The final list of proteins was used for gene ontology characterization (levels 2 and 3) using PANTHER (Mi et al., 2013), regarding molecular function, protein class and signaling pathways. A levels 4 and 5 gene ontology analysis was performed through an over-representation analysis using the ConsensusPathDB (Kamburov et al., 2013), for molecular function.

Here, we tested how the oncogenes AKT and MYC affect the ability to shift between respiration and glycolysis. Using immortalized mammary epithelial cellsMCF10A, we discovered constitutively active AKT but not MYC induced cell death in galactose culture, where cells must rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy generation. However, the negative effects of AKT were short-lived, and AKT-expressing cells recommenced growth after ~15 days in galactose culture. To identify the mechanisms regulating AKT-mediated cell death, we first used metabolomics and found that AKT cells dying in galactose culture exhibited upregulated glutathione metabolism. Next, using shotgun proteomics, we discovered AKT cells dying in galactose upregulated proteins related to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a known response to oxidative stress. We therefore measured levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and discovered galactose culture induced ROS only in cells expressing AKT. Additionally, we found thatdiscovered the ROS scavenger catalase rescued AKT-expressing cells from galactose culture-induced cell death. We then demonstrated that breast cancer cell lines with constitutively active AKT signaling also exhibited cell death in galactose culture and rescue by catalase. Together, our results demonstrate that AKT but not MYC induces a metabolic vulnerability in cancer cells, namely the  that restricted flexibility to use oxidative phosphorylation. 	"[""Homo sapiens (Human)""]"			"[""Q Exactive""]"		"[""Shotgun proteomics""]"		AKT, MYC, proteomics, metabolomics, galactose, oxidative culture, oxidative stress, ROS, catalase, cancer cells survival;	The samples were randomized and injected into an Easy 1200 nanoLC ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a Q Exactive quadruple orbitrap mass spectrometry (Thermo Fisher).

Although AFP have been widely used as important biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and evaluation, the AFP level has a huge variation among HCC patient populations. Understanding the intrinsic heterogeneities of HCC associated with AFP levels is essential for the molecular mechanism studies of HCC with different AFP levels as well as for the potential early diagnosis and personalized treatment of HCC with AFP negative. Here, an integrated glycoproteomic and proteomic analysis of low and high AFP level of HCC tumors was performed to investigate the intrinsic heterogeneities of site-specific glycosylation associated with different AFP levels of HCC. we identified many commonly altered site-specific glycans from HCC tumors regardless of AFP levels, including decreased modifications by oligo-mannose and sialylated bi-antennary glycans, and increased modifications by bisecting glycans. By relative quantifying the intact glycopeptides between low and high AFP tumor groups, the great heterogeneities of site-specific N-glycans between two groups of HCC tumors were also uncovered. We found that several sialylated but not core fucosylated tri-antennary glycans were uniquely high-regulated in low AFP level of HCC tumors, while many core fucosylated bi-antennary or hybrid glycans as well as bisecting glycans were uniquely increased in high AFP tumors. The data provide a valuable resource for future HCC studies regarding the mechanism, heterogeneities and new biomarker discovery.

Ubiquitin itself is encoded by four different genes, either as single copy of ubiquitin fused to ribosomal proteins, or by polyubiquitin precursors3. Early studies identified several additional genes potentially coding for ubiquitin, but they were considered as pseudogenes due to differences in amino acids, or lack of apparent transcription4-6. Through analysis of large-scale proteomics and RNA sequencing experiments, we found evidence for expression at the mRNA and protein levels of several ubiquitin pseudogenes. Our results show that UBBP4, a pseudogene of the UBB subfamily, produces functional ubiquitin proteins with different amino acids composition compared to the canonical sequence. These ubiquitins variants are covalently conjugated to proteins that are different from ubiquitin, and proteins modified by UBBP4 are not targeted for proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, invalidation of UBBP4 results in slower cell division, and accumulation of lamin A within the nucleolus. This implies that a subset of proteins reported as ubiquitin targets could rather be through these variants arising from wrongly annotated pseudogenes, and that there is a specificity in the modification and differences in the functional consequence of proteins modified by these new ubiquitin variants. The identification of additional ubiquitins thus entails a new layer of complexity in protein ubiquitylation that has been unnoticed until now.

Here, we show that E4orf4’s tumoricidal activity correlated with changes in perinuclear actomyosin contractility that are controlled by an interaction with the Par3 polarity protein. Surprisingly, E4orf4 enhanced apical-basal polarity in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. In contrast, in tumorigenic cells, it induced a high incidence of actin-dependent nuclear bleb rupture. This process, which was regulated by the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, promoted nuclear efflux of E4orf4 and the breakdown of the nuclear compartment. Significantly, Par3 also regulated the incidence of transient nuclear envelope rupture due to the reduced nuclear rigidity in cells depleted of lamins, in absence of E4orf4. Thus, using E4orf4 as a probing tool, we uncovered a so far un-appreciated role for Par3 in controlling the actin-dependent forces acting on the nuclear envelope to remodel nuclear shape, which might be a defining feature of tumor cells that is harnessed by E4orf4.

Together, our chemical proteomics tools confirmed thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) as a main auranofin target, with perturbation of oxidoreductase pathways as the top mechanism of drug action. Additional indirect targets included NFKB2 and CHORDC1. Our comprehensive data can be used as a proteomic signature resource for further analyses of the effects of auranofin.

In the C-terminal tail region of human heme oxygenase-2 (HO2), there are two HRMs whose cysteines form a disulfide bond; when reduced, these cysteines are available to bind Fe3+-heme. Heme binding to the HRMs is independent of the HO2 catalytic active site in the core of the protein, where heme binds with high affinity and is degraded to biliverdin. Here, we describe the reversible, protein-mediated transfer of heme between the HRMs and the core of HO2. Using HDX-MS to monitor the dynamics of HO2 with and without Fe3+-heme bound to the HRMs and to the core, we detected conformational changes in the catalytic core only in one state of the catalytic cycle – when Fe3+-heme is bound to the HRMs and the core is in the apo state. The conformational changes detected are consistent with transfer of heme between binding sites. Indeed, Fe3+-heme bound to the HRMs is transferred to the apo-core upon either independently expressing the core and a construct spanning the HRM-containing tail or after single turnover of heme at the core. In addition, we observed transfer of heme from the core to the HRMs and equilibration of heme between the core and HRMs. We thus propose a Fe3+-heme transfer model in which heme bound to the HRMs is readily transferred to the catalytic site for degradation to facilitate turnover but can also equilibrate between the sites to maintain heme homeostasis.

Previous studies have identified genetic driver events of early stage disease when the tumor is confined to the eye. In this study, we have characterized genomic events in UM metastases using whole-genome and RNA sequencing from thirty-two and twenty-eight patients, respectively, and profiled individual tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a number of the metastases. We find that 91% of the patients have metastases carrying inactivating events in the tumor suppressor BAP1 and this coincided with somatic alterations in GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2, PLCB4, SF3B1 and/or CDKN2A. Mutational signature analysis revealed a rare subset of tumors with prominent signs of UV damage, associated with outlier mutational burden. We study copy number variations (CNV) and find overrepresented events, some of which were not altered in matched primary eye tumors. A focused siRNA screen identified functionally significant genes of some of the segments recurrently gained. We reintroduced a functional copy of BAP1 into a patient-derived BAP1 deficient tumor cell line and found broad transcriptomic changes of genes associated with subtype distinction and prognosis in primary UM. Lastly, our analysis of the immune microenvironments of metastases revealed a presence of tumor-reactive T cells. However, a large fraction expressed the immune checkpoint receptors such as TIM-3, TIGIT and LAG3. These results provide an updated view of genomic events represented in metastatic UM and immune interactions in advanced lesions.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is required for muscle adaptation following exercise but little is known about acute post-translational regulation and proteome remodelling during exercise. Here, we used quantitative proteomics to study ubiquitin-signalling dynamics in human skeletal muscle biopsies from healthy males before, during and after a single bout of high-intensity exercise. Exercise resulted in a marked depletion of protein ubiquitylation consistent with proteasome activation. This was also associated with acute post-translational modification of protein abundance via a network of proteases.

In eukaryotes, the NatE complex contains the NAA50 catalytic subunit with substrate specificity for N-terminal methionine acetylation and NatA, which facilitates ribosomal targeting of the complex for co-translational activity. NatA, contains NAA10 catalytic and NAA15 auxiliary subunits, and forms a complex with a protein with intrinsic NAA10 inhibitory activity, HYPK. The molecular basis for how the human NAA10 and NAA50 catalytic subunits within NatE complex coordinate function and how HYPK regulates NatE activity is unknown. Here, we characterize the biochemical interplay between the human NAA10 and NAA50 catalytic subunits of NatE and its regulation by HYPK and correlate this to the cryo-EM structures of the human NatE and NatE/HYPK complexes. We show that NAA50 and HYPK exhibit negative cooperative binding to NatA in vitro and in human cells, by inducing NAA15 shifts in opposing directions. NAA50 and HYPK each contributes to NAA10 activity inhibition through structural alteration of the NAA10 substrate binding site. NatE is about 8-fold more active than NAA50, likely due to a reduced entropic cost for substrate binding through NatA tethering, but is inhibited by HYPK through structural alteration of the NatE substrate binding site. Taken together, these studies reveal the molecular basis for coordinated N-terminal acetylation by the NAA10 and NAA50 catalytic subunits of NatE and its modulation by HYPK.

2236	PXD014524	https://www.ebi.ac.uk:443/pride/ws/archive/project/PXD014524	A simple peptide quantification approach for MS-based proteomics quality control	Despite its growing popularity and use, bottom-up proteomics remains a complex analytical methodology. Its general workflow consists of three main steps: sample preparation, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and computational data analysis. Quality assessment of the different steps and components of this workflow is instrumental to identify technical flaws and to avoid loss of precious measurement time and sample material. However, assessment of the extent of sample losses along the sample preparation protocol, in particular after proteolytic digestion, is not yet routinely implemented because of the lack of an accurate and straightforward method to quantify peptides. Here, we report on the use of a microfluidic UV/visible spectrophotometer to quantify MS-ready peptides directly in MS loading solvent, consuming only 2 µl of sample. We compared the performance of the microfluidic spectrophotometer with a standard device and determined the optimal sample amount for LC-MS/MS analysis on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer using a dilution series of a commercial K562 cell digest. Careful evaluation of selected LC and MS parameters allowed us to define 3 µg as an optimal peptide amount to be injected on this particular LC-MS/MS system. Finally, using tryptic digests from human HEK293T cells and showed that injecting equal peptide amounts, rather than approximate ones, results in less variable LC-MS/MS and protein quantification data. The obtained quality improvement together with easy implementation of the approach makes it possible to routinely quantify MS-ready peptides as a next step in daily proteomics quality control.

Due to tremendous efforts in cancer research, the overall survival of metastatic melanoma has doubled; however, complete eradication of the disease is almost unknown. With the advent of proteomics, deep-mining studies can reach low-abundant expression areas. The complexity of the proteome, however, still surpasses the dynamic range capabilities of current analytical techniques. Consequently, many predicted protein products with potential biological functions have not yet been verified in experimental proteomic data.  This category of ‘missing proteins’ (MP) is comprised of all proteins that have been predicted but are currently unverified. As part of the initiative launched in 2016 in the United States, the European Cancer Moonshot Center has performed numerous deep proteomics analyses on samples from MM patients. In this study, nine MPs were clearly identified by mass spectrometry in MM metastases. Some MPs significantly-correlated with proteins that possess identical PFAM structural domains; and other MPs were significantly-associated with cancer-related proteins. This is the first study to our knowledge, where unknown and novel proteins have been annotated within metastasis, from Melanoma Cancer patients.

Here, we investigate the RNA binding function of ATRX, a chromatin remodeler with roles in silencing of repetitive regions of the genome and in recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).  We identify ATRX RNA binding regions (RBRs) and discover that the major ATRX RBR lies within the N-terminal region of the protein, distinct from its PHD and helicase domains.  Deletion of this ATRX RBR (ATRXRBR) compromises ATRX interactions with RNAs in vitro and in vivo and alters its chromatin binding properties. Genome-wide studies reveal that loss of RNA interactions results in a redistribution of ATRX on chromatin. Finally, our studies identify a role for ATRX-RNA interactions in regulating PRC2 localization to a subset of polycomb target genes.

All parameters for database searching were kept as default. We used a custom database containing common contaminants, human ATRX (UniProt accession P46100) and bovine Rnase1 (P61823). The “Intensity” value of the peptides from MaxQuant were used for quantification. For DIA runs, we extracted the chromatograms based on the spectral library generated by the MaxQuant search of DDA runs. The extracted ion chromatogram was performed by using Skyline (MacLean et al. 2010). For quantification, we used the area under the curve of the precursor signal.  RBR-ID analysis After removal of suspected contaminants, Maxquant peptide abundances were normalized by the sum of all peptide intensities in each MS run. For each peptide a log2-converted ratio was calculated between samples treated with or without 4SU to assess depletion mediated by RNA-crosslinking. For generation of these ratios, the mean intensity of peptides with only zero values was assigned as 0.5*(minimum observed mean peptide intensity). P values for peptides were calculated using an unpaired, two-sided Student’s t test. RBR-ID scores, which are an estimate of RNA crosslinking likelihood (He et al., 2016), were calculated for each peptide as follows:  score = -log2(+4SU/-4SU normalized peptide ratio)*(log10(P-value))2  For residue level RBR-ID scores, we summed the RBR-ID score of each peptide overlapping any given amino acid and smoothed the resulting curve using Friedman's ‘super smoother’ (Friedman, 1984).

Known and new tissue specific or enriched proteins were identified and compared to transcriptome data. Many ubiquitous transcripts are found to encode highly tissue specific proteins. Discordance in the sites of RNA expression and protein detection also revealed potential sites of synthesis and action of protein signaling molecules. Overall, these results provide an extraordinary resource, and demonstrate that understanding protein levels can provide insights into metabolism, regulation, secretome, and human diseases.

MS1 scan was acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with resolution 120,000 at m/z 400. Top speed instrument method was used for MS2 and MS3. For MS2, the isolation width was set at 0.7 Da and isolated precursors were fragmented by CID at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 35% and analyzed in the ion trap using “turbo” scan. Following the acquisition of each MS2 spectrum, a synchronous precursor selection (SPS) MS3 scan was collected on the top 5 most intense ions in the MS2 spectrum. SPS-MS3 precursors were fragmented by higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) at an NCE of 65% and analyzed using the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000. We used SEQUEST in ProteomeDiscoverer (ThermoFisher Scientific) for protein identification.  Raw files from 12 fractions of each sample were combined together for a single search against GENCODE V19 human proteome database (4). Mass tolerance of 10ppm was used for precursor ion and 0.6 Dalton for fragment ions. The search included cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification. Peptide N-terminal and lysine TMT 10plex modification, protein N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. Up to two missed cleavages were allowed for trypsin digestion. The peptide false discovery rate (FDR) was set as <1% using Percolator. For protein identification, at least one unique peptide with a minimum 6 amino acid length was required. For protein quantitation, only unique peptides with reporter ion mass tolerance of less than 10ppm were used.  Peptide precursor ion isolation purity should be >50%, signal-to-noise (S/N) > 15 and the summed S/N of all channels > 200.  Peptides passing these criteria were summed, thereby giving more weight to the most-intense peptides. We also pooled together all the spectra in this study for a single search at protein FDR of 1%. For structure variant peptide search, we reconstructed the protein database by adding all the structure variant peptides to the database. The structure variant peptides were extracted based on the SNP information provided by GTEx consortium.	2020-01-07	"[[""DOI:10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.036"",""PMID:32916130""]]"
